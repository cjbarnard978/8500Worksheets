own government essential in the conduct of the war hen america first went into the war to fight for democ racy for european men there were those who said that the suf’fragists should furl their banners and wait till the war was over to resume the struggle to secure democracy for ameri can women they said that the right of self government for which ameri can women had been so long fighting had no kinship with the right of self government for which european men were fighting they said that it was not patriotic for american women to think or care about the right of self government in america when america was thinking so much and caring so much about the right of self government in europe they said that woman suffrage was not a war problem that it had nothing whatever to do with the successful conduct of the war and that it was harsh and selfish for women to insist upon it while the vast problems of the war pressed for consideration m eantime an authoritative voice had begun speaking for america on the subject of war it interpreted and clari fied as nobody and nothing else had done europe fell easily into the habit of listening when it spoke and of valuing the content president wilson’s war aims wilson’s ideals the w il sonian democracy the words became catch phrases all over it made men know and remember what the war was for europe america was justified in her own eyes and american gathered around the president with moral support and cor fidence without regard to party able men national legislators in particular took pleasure in boasting that since unity was vastly desirable and since the president’s ability to see into and through a matter to its answer was so marked they were ready to defer to his judgment and be guided by his conclusions they were pleased to put the matter as a mark of their patriotism on measure after measure pertaining to the safe conduct of the war the president’s judgment and conclusions have been accepted as hnal him securer in him than in itself individual dissent has ironed itself smooth in order to meet as a converter of the dis sonants he has had no equal y et national legislators who have supported him staunchly on other issues because he was the country’s war leader and their allegiance to country was involved in their allegiance to his leadership have pointed out that he has never oflicially taken his stand for the passage of the federal suffrage amendment as a war measure and that they were obligated to his support only on such measures as he considered essential for winning the war now comes the president with a statement unofficial to be sure but unequivocal as to his view of the essential need of passing the federal amendment in order to win the war writing to the president late in june senator shields of tennessee pointed out that if he could be persuaded that the adoption of the suffrage resolution would contribute to the successful prosecution of the war he would unhesitatingly vote for it but that he was not so persuaded these were plain words but the president’s reply was plainer still in his view the passage of the amendment at this time is an essential psychological element in the conduct of the war for democracy america’s action upon this amendment will in the president’s belief have an important and immediate influence upon the whole atmosphere and morale of the nations engaged in the war and every day i am coming to see how supremely important that side of the thing is we can win if we have the will to win hen it comes to a question of choice between the presi dent’s judgment and the judgment of the individual senator as to what are the essential elements of winning the war it is to be remembered that america chose long before the president included the passage of the federal suerage amend ment among the essentials it has come to the pass that it is exceedingly ditiicult for the american people in this supreme war crisis to brook having one of the essential elements of success defiected and defeated by men who have pledged themselves to the president’s support in winning the war how much longer will the obstructionists in the united states senate be allowed to block the passage of the amendment and by what name does america know those who fortify themselves against the elements essential to the successful termination of the war

suffrage women who reside in the fifth congressional district of brooklyn have re ceived the following letter from united states senator william m calder a letter much ap preciated as a courtesy extended by the senator and as an indication of the decided change that has recently been observed in the attitude of the public oflicial toward his women constituents the new york state legislature of 1917 reapportioned the congressional districts of brooklyn as a result the district in which you reside has no member of congress in view of that fact i am now writing to you as your senator to say that i would be glad to have you communicate with me when there is any legislation pending in washington in which you are interested or when i can in my official capacity serve you here permit me to congratulate you on taking advantage of the first opportunity to register it indicates that you propose to take an active part in the affairs of the nation state and city it is a splendid thing at this time for our women to realize that it is their patriotic duty to participate in both the primaries and elections mrs catt on the senate vote ll reports from washington indicate that there is every possibility that the minute important war measures are out of the way the federal amendment will be called up in the senate for action suffrage leaders are so confident of the result that they are preparing plans to launch ratification campaigns in forty five of the states whose legislatures meet next year the outstanding feature of my own op timism says mrs carrie chapman catt presi dent of the national american woman suf frage association is the aggressive part president wilson has taken in his efforts to convince certain senators that it is to the coun try’s best interests that the amendment be speedily submitted to the states the presi dent’s letters to senators shields and baird corroborate the statements made some time ago that the president was prepared to go to great lengths in his fight for suffrage added to this are the reports coming from authoritative circles in washington that visits back home have convinced a number of sena tors that a vote for suffrage represents 100 per cent in political expediency suffrage senti ment was never at greater height than during the last few weeks and politicians who were deaf before are now waking up to the fact that the sentiment for the federal amendment has reached a state of crystalization which presages disaster to those politicians who would impede its progress a message from miss hay s loyal supporters of

would be of interest to all who are working for suffrage and a timely warn ing to all politicians as to what the future holds for them to know that a man that was a known anti in kansas before women were en franchised cannot now be elected to a public office of any importance the recent primary election in kansas for the nomination of a united states senator has demonstrated that this is true in this state and will be also true in other states after the women have obtained the franchise mr charles scott of iola kansas formerly congressman for this district was at the bot tom of the list in the race for the nomination on the republican ticket for united states senator the other two men governor capper and ex governor stubbs were both well known sutfragists i was president of the third district during the suffrage campaign and had occasion to ask mr charles scott at various times when he was making public speeches to say something for suffrage but he consistently refused the requests of both the suffrage leaders and those of his friends mr scott is a man of high personal character but has that type of mind that cannot grasp a change in public sentiment but believes that what has been is now and ever will be he believes that if an idea has prevailed for sev eral hundred years it becomes a sacred in heritance and can be changed only at the peril of civilization of course he might concede that we might try out municipal suerage for women a few hundred years and if no evil results followed we might gradually extend it to state and then to national suffrage he did not advocate the repeal of municipal suffrage in kansas but it had no doubt not had a long enough trial to pass judgment upon in his opinion mr scott can never be elected or even nomi nated as a representative of kansas as he can not even carry his own district this ought to be driven home to every man that is now opposing suffrage in the united states senate for the time is near at hand when the women of every state will help to select the men that shall represent their state i do not think that mr scott would now state that he was opposed to suffrage and would no doubt vote for the federal amendment but it is before sueragc for women becomes a fact in a state that sup port in that state is needed and not afterwards sincerely mas magdalen b munson the spirit of rhode island 66 he

lieutenant colonel m d has written the following letter to his wife this othcer has seen front line service the letter was brought to attention by mrs oakes ames of north easton i wish i were a poet to write a few verses on the text of woman suerage it would make you sit up and take notice at your old gumshoe it is not the things the women over here are doing so much as the way they do it and their attitude on the whole proposition you see the old idea of non combatants and the danger zones are quite changed with the back area bombing and shelling game so that hundreds of nurses canteen workers red cross people of all sorts are now exposed to the dan ger of bombs and shells i could give you tales galore they not only stand it and stick till they are driven out or pulled out and often after they have been ordered out several times but till the last patient or civilian is out then and then only do they come and all the time perfectly placid and calm and matter of fact my attitude on their being up there now is quite different from what it was then i won dered whether we ought to allow them to be in the danger zone and wondered why the british last summer did not send all the nurses right away down to the base when they began to bomb the place but there was no question in the nurses minds where their place was and i think there would have been an awful row from them if it was suggested that they should re tire now i feel that they have so earned their right to be there that we have no decision in the matter but that we must give them freely the privilege to go where they want to go sarah cunningham 20 years old with a little special training at p h stayed and looked after her remaining patients long after she had been told to clear out and after the others had gone and the place was hardly livable another 23 year old girl who found a lot of poilus coming through the town she was in and having to wait over night wired to the red cross what shall i do the answer came feed em so she got a cart and for almost 24 hours she handed out stuff from the tail of the cart and in the freezing weather both of her hands were frozen many other nurses have stuck to their wards while the enemy planes were overhead and the bombs dropping often near them and not lying on their tummies but going about quietly cheer fully jollying the patients as if nothing was going on last summer the nurses on night duty alone often with practically no light at all were up hour after hour especially in the resuscitation ward where often there would be four to ten deaths a night gee but it makes you want to shout or cry or pray and to think that you who as soon as the opportunity offers go into this sort of work as a matter of course and ask and take no quarter or favors should have to ask and petition and light for equal rights for the suffrage why it is the most ridiculous thing in the world if i am not busy when i come back and there should be any question about this i think i shall take the stump for the vimmens vote and to think that you who as soon as the opportunity ofers go into this sort of work as a matter of course and ask and take no quarter or favors should have to ask and petition and fight for equal rights for the sufrage why it is the most ridiculous thing in the world women in men’s jobs n answer to a letter women in men’s j obs of august 8 written by henry chan cellor in the new york globe i would say that i am the soldier husband of a conductorette and fail to see why any one thinks that a woman cannot maintain her self respect and womanli ness even though she is holding a man’s job did the women step up and try to take the men's jobs when they were not needed no they waited till the time came when they were compelled to work for themselves and then did the men the honor of taking their jobs so that they could show themselves americans women in men's jobs must be willing workers to stick to their posts in spite of the slurs thrown at them by what are called men the women should have their vote and they will have it aren’t they worth it i con sider my wife on a plane as high as any man and much higher than some men now that they are put to the test the women seem to be very little weaker than the men they deserve a vote more than a man who will actually throw mud on a woman’s name in general conductorettes should have seats where is the manly instinct of henry chancellor and his like has he no mother wife or sister and why does he not get some kind of a rank to be written with his name before he considers himself authorized to criticize the women who are willing to work hard so that their dear ones might go to the front to protect the women and children from the fate of belgium it

same as to prohibition and doubtless always will be if the women of west virginia want a strong exponent of suffrage in the united states senate they would do well to turn their attention toward nominating and electing major davis elkins he was never known to break his word when once given he never reversed himself on any political policy for which he had declared so long as such policy was for the betterment of his state and his people a man who is brave enough to come out in the open and say that he favors woman’s suerage is certainly entitled to all the support that women can given

principle by mamie w colvin candidate for lieutenant governor of new york he prohibition party was the first to champion equal suffrage many years in advance of any other party it declared for equal suerage in its first platform in 1872 it has consistently stood by this principle seating women as delegates in its conventions and electing women to membership on its commit tees because of this fact it merits considera tion of its history and principles the prohibition party has an unstained po litical record of nearly fifty years it is one of the marvels of political history that a po litical party without the spoils of office to sus tain it and with but few of its candidates elected has year after year continued to chal lenge the attention of the nation on its su preme issue it is the longest lived minority party in the history of our country since its organization more than a score of minor parties have been launched sailed the political seas for a time and disappeared its source of power is its heroic and persistent devotion to a great prin ciple a national political problem the most shameful page of american his tory is that which depicts the rise and growth of the liquor power in american politics the adoption of the internal revenue system in 1862 and the subsequent adoption of the high license system in most of the states entrenched the liquor trafiic in the government revenues and every increase in the liquor tax has served to make it more difficult to dislodge the u s brewers association organized also in 1862 entered politics and as early as 1867 declared that it would sustain no candidate of whatever party in any election who is in any way disposed toward the total abstinence cause the liquor traffic is protected by national law promoted by national liquor organizations which wield a balance of power and dominate political parties and the evil consequences of that trafiic are incapable of being confined within state boundaries the prohibition party holds that these facts make the liquor trafiic a national problem and its destruction the great est internal task which america faces furthermore it holds that the magnitude of the task requires a political party committed to prohibition to deal with it successfully in ad ministration as well as legislation a party or farseeing statesmanship a great many people think that prohibition ists are people of but one idea but the plat forms of the party bear witness to the fact of the farseeing constructive statesmanship which seeks not only to change the attitude of the government on the liquor traffic and harmonize the action of all departments of government on this subject but to face squarely all other problems confronting the nation some one has said that a statesman is one who leads public opinion a mere politician fol lows the crowd if this is true then truly the men and women of the prohibition party during the last half a century have been the real statesmen of america the statement has been made by a'noted chi cago journalist that most of the reforms of the last generation have had their inception on the prohibition party ticket in the minds of the prohibition party some of the principles which were first championed in the platform of the prohibition party most of them many years before they were taken up by any other parties are equal suffrage 1872 civil service reform 1872 reform labor legislation 1872 direct election of u s senators 1876 twentyofour years before either one of the old parties ad vocated it suppression of polygamy

party in the last national platform 1916 written a year before our nation entered the war we pledged ourselves to maintain an effective army and navy and to provide coast defenses ade quate for

alaska and in unnumbered other pro jects which will make our soldiers constructive builders of peace for such service there should be an adequate industrial wage a plank on social justice included old age pensions insurance against unemployment and help for needy mothers all of which could be provided from what is wasted for drink we declared for the public ownership of public utilities for the

loyal party in american politics today for within its ranks there does not wrist a pro german constituency the german idea of personal liberty is incompatible with the pro hibition american idea of

in america were to create and promote german political solidarity to force the ger man languagc upon all pupils in the public schools throughout the united states and to defeat prohibition legislation as opposed to the german idea of personal liberty these facts brand the brewing industry as pro german and if for no other reason we should prohibit the manufacture and sale of beer in this country war emphasizes the need or pnonrnrrtou the nation is in war and food fuel trans portation labor money ships everything that is essential to winning the war is retarded and hindered by the liquor traffic fifty four million bushels of barley are still wasted annually in the manufacture of beer coal operators say that 15 to 25 per cent more coal could be mined each year if prohibition prevailed the brewers had last year the unrestricted use of 700,000 cars to carry beer professor irving fisher of yale president of the american economic association says that the ediciency of labor would be increased at least 10 per cent and probably much more under prohibition enough money is wasted every year in the direct cost of drink to subscribe for the first liberty loan and build a panama canal secretary daniels said in every case where we have had a shipyard or a community go from open saloons to prohibition there has been an increase of efiiciency these facts indicate the magnitude of the prohibition issue in war time and brand the liquor traffic as the strongest ally the kaiser has why von 2 the pnomnrrrou ticket 1 because the prohibition party is a clean oarty of uncompromising adherence to prin ciple a it does not compete for the liquor vote nor court the favor of the lower elements nor will it barter away public morals for paltry revenue or party success 2 because it is a national party no sec tional appeal championing a great national is sue of prime importance to the health wealth and happiness of our people 3 because of its statesmanship progres sive without radicalism conservative without reactionary tendencies a it offers a constructive solution of the liquor problem providing for an efiicient ad ministration as well as mere enactment it provides for responsible party government 4 because of its unswerving loyalty un fettered by fear of alienating the beer drinking german vote a the liquor interests are pro german and unpatriotic by wasting food fuel transporta tion labor and money and hindering in every way the successful prosecution of the war 5 because it offers an opportunity to ex press convictions in politics a we hold that no vote is thrown away if it expresses conviction but it is thrown away only when it is used to gamble in elections pick a winner or help elect a candidate be cause there is a chance of his election b we believe

249 the anti saloon league its aim and political policy by adella potter wet and dry map of the united states jan 1 1893 win prohibition territory studodm local option territory bloch litcnu turltory white spot in slack states than indian amnion by federal law he anti saloon league is a national body with 48 state organizations its aim is the total elimination of the traffic in alcoholic liquor as a beverage it in no way attacks the manufacture of alcohol for industrial or sac ramental use its method is non partisan when it was organized in 1893 there was con siderable prohibition sentiment in the country but only six dry states three of which shortly lapsed back to license there seemed no prac tical way of getting the existing prohibition sen timent into action as the majority of voters would not leave the republican and demo cratic parties to join the prohibition party at this crisis the founders of the league ap peared upon the scene and said you don’t have to stop voting your own party ticket in prder to get prohibition simply insist that the representatives of your party if elected vote for prohibition measures when this new viewpoint got over to the peo ple things began to happen republican and democratic legislators voted for prohibition laws and submitted state prohibition amend ments to their constituents with the result that today 28 states are dry either by statute or constitutional amendment the hawaiian isl ands alaska porto rico the united states territory around the panama canal and wash ington our national capitol are also dry sev eral other states through local option gains are almost dry last december the national pro hibition amendment was submitted by a two thirds vote of both houses of congress to the 48 state legislatures fourteen of these legis latures arizona delaware georgia kentucky maryland massachusetts mississippi montana south carolina north dakota south dakota texas virginia and louisiana have already voted to accept this national amendment of the fourteen massachusetts delaware maryland kentucky and louisiana are still wet states both democratic and republican states have ratihed the amendment and democratic repub lican and socialist representatives have voted for and against the question it has been and is an absolutely non partisan measure the anti saloon league is not another temperance society or a political party it is not a rival of any other organization but it is as its name implies a league of organiza tions it is a clearing house for churches and temperance societies its primary function is not the creation of anti saloon sentiment the word saloon is used because it typifies the mod ern attempt to capitalize human frailty and is branded by the court as the main cause of law lessness and crime but the direction of exist ing sentiment to secure immediate results it is non partisan and interdenominational it has found that prohibition prohibits better than regulation regulates its fundamental proposi tion is for every person who is opposed to the saloon to unite with every other opponent of the saloon without reference to what either of them thinks concerning any other question it aims to make it possible for every citizen to vote directly and effectively against liquor as a beverage and at the same time to vote his own party ticket the league has to do with candidates and things for which they stand not with parties or platforms not being a party the league never nominates candidates but when no party candidate is satisfactory it may encourage the nomination of an independent the perfection of the league idea is not to make the league as an organization a great political power or an end in itself it prefers to have the or ganization stay in the background while the citizens as individuals become so influential for righteousness that all parties will stand for moral principles as a matter of course and divide only upon questions of administration it knows that the saloon on the corner is not our grestest menace hilt rather the saloon en throned in our government unseat the one and it will be easy to get rid of the other the success of this policy is shown by the dry territory gained and the hatred of the liquor forces toward the league over two thirds the area of new york state is now dry 20 cities using their new power given them under the city local option law voted last april to do away with the sale of liquor within their boundaries candidates of all parties running for the assembly and state senate are feeling the pressure of the prohibition senti ment that is demanding the ratification of the national prohibition amendment at albany this winter this sentiment is so strong that practically every candidate who is not for the prohibition program the ratification of the na tional amendment tries to camouflage his liquor adherence by announcing that he is for prohibition for the submission of a state amendment which means no action for three or four years or for a referendum on the question which is the unconstitutional inef fective fraudulent program of the liquor in terests the liquor forces themselves in statements published in brewery magazines and at open meetings give the credit for this situation to the non partisan policy of the anti saloon league extracts from the church in action the saloon by william h anderson state

their friends at a roof garden ball and war time fashion show mrs leonard g foods one of pennsylvania’s most active and capable sutfragists who also has been particu larly active in food conservation and other patriotic work directed the big fete as general chairman of the com mittee in charge this committee in cluded many widely known patriotic women not directly identified with suffrage as well as practically all those who have been active soldiers in the battle for the ballot timed as it was to come just after the close of the third liberty loan the suffrage ball provided a brief mo ment of gaiety for the many women who had labored intensively in the loan campaign and for many months previous to that drive in other activi ties the festivity proved so suc __ cessful that suffragists of many other i 3 sections of the country secured the details of the arrangements from mrs woods the most recent appeal having come from canadians visiting pitts burgh iwho wanted to raise funds for war work to our allies across the border mrs woods contributed the use of costumes the fashion show which proved popular exhibited reproductions of the war time fashions of the revolu tion and the civil war ending with a present day parade before and after the war tableaux included the care free american girl as she used to be interested in tennis and other light sports and as the same girl is now garbed not in tennis togs but in war garden bloomers the hoe replacing the racquet the typical boudoirgirl with her novel and confections was ex hibited as transformed into the motor corps girl and the bridge devotee at the card table into the red cross worker seated at another more serious table making gauze bandages all the different war activi ties were shown liberty loan work selling of war savings and thrift stamps played their attractive part in depicting the serious side of women’s life at the present in contrast to her alleged frivolity of the pre war days flags and colors of the allies draped the balcony of the big roof garden of the william penn hotel and provided patriotic coloring the many officers stationed in pittsburgh were present as guests of the general committee an automobile a jeweled american hag of rubies sapphire and diamonds donated gowns and other desirable articles were auctioned for large sums in acknowledging the pittsburgh gift mrs rogers announced

g oods you very warme for this splendid gift and through you all those who have assisted in making the benefit a success the gift is very timely as we have just taken over at the request of the french gov ernment a 300 bed hospital for gassed men the entire charge of which will be in the hands of a group of doctors nurses and aides whom we are getting together to send over at the earliest possible moment the maintenance of this hospital will cost about 75,000 and is in addition to what we have already undertaken in france i think it perfectly fine the way in which the women have responded to the appeal for the overseas hospitals and this fine gift from pennsylvania is another evidence of their deep solicitude for the men at the front in their anxiety to do their share of war service work tag day in providence he three thousand dollar quota assigned to rhode island toward the women’s oversea hospital fund has now been secured mrs james w algeo chairman of the rhode island suffrage party says that the ease with which this money and also the pledge to the national and current expenses of her organi zation have been raised reads like a fairy story we first sent out circular letters she says after the gude man 0 the house had given one hundred dollars to encourage our efforts mrs le baron c colt daughter in law of our senior senator from rhode island who votes yes on the federal amendment became treasurer our letters met with a favorable response but not nearly enough to cover the 3,000 so we decided to tag for the remainder now tagging is a de lightful occupation if you can get enough workers which is not always easy in the hot days of summer but the appeal for the women and babies of france proved irresistible and in the three tag days carried on by us many a woman did her bit by standing for hours on a hot and dusty corner disposing of our bright yellow tags with their winsome picture of mother with baby in her arms and the motto pour la france surrounded by the lily of france miss mary cass our suffrage party leader in woonsocket and her sister miss madeleine cass netted over 1,300 by their brilliant work in their city mrs william poole leader in ward 8 of providence produced eighty five workers and 400 in her territory through the united efforts of miss althea l hall suffrage leader in pawtucket and mrs ellen ryan jolly more than one thousand dollars in that city was taken in ex change for tags had we had longer notice of the event said mrs jolly who is a clever business woman from the top of her curly dark hair to the tip of her tiny shoe we could have cleared 5,000 and i really believe her hospital baskets a suggestion ow are you raising your funds for the women’s oversea hospitals this is the way two young women who were patients of dr caroline finley before she went to france are doing it they have already sold 100 worth of berries and small fruits which they have picked and marketed themselves from bushes of their own raising they ex pect to augment this sum by sending into the city to friends who have agreed to buy them for the hospital fund bushel baskets of as sorted vegetables these they call hospital baskets they will contain whatever is fresh est and most marketable the day the basket is shipped august 24 1918 british land army to american sisters he woman’s land army of america has just received an official communication from the woman’s land army of britain which was presented to the board of directors at a meeting in august and is made public by mrs william pierson hamilton first vice president of the board who is acting chairman in the absence of the president mrs william adams brown the letter brings an inspiring message from the war workers of england who are in the fields 300,000 strong to the new sister organization on this side of the water the letter reads the land army of britain congratulates with heartfelt cordiality the woman’s land army of america for a great beginning and the promise of a great future your vigorous young organization already of twenty states has created a new source of inspiration in us who have labored since the beginning of the war while your splendid help in the fight against hunger and famine will quicken victory for the allies who have not looked in vain for your loyal and generous sup port the american land army is facing its responsibilities in a manner worthy of the strength of a great democratic country under the leadership of a great president and we in britain are proud to have been the means of in spiring action so far reaching our own ex perience extending now through four years of war while it has taught us to appreciate your diliiculties has also given us faith in the power of women to overcome your work of keeping up the food supply is vital and it is an essen tial contribution to that light for freedom in which we are both engaged and in the result of which lies the future of all nations in the land trenches behind your armies and our own a light is being bravely waged fraught with issues no less grave than on the seas and battle fields of europe british women doing their utmost are confident that the women working together in one great cause and in one great spirit will remain as an un broken front till victory is achieved rs hamilton in giving this letter to the press stated that the board of direc tors feel very greatly encouraged not only by the stimulus of such recognition but by the reports represented at the board meeting these reports have come in from every section of the country to the national oliice of the land army and show a remarkable progress in the introduc tion of women as farm laborers and an in variable success wherever units have been es tablished thirty nine states are now organized under the w'oman’s land afmy of america of these seventeen have placed active units in operation while others are canvassing the farm labor situation and strengthening their organiza tion so that they may be ready to meet the de mand another season one hundred and twenty seven units of women are now at work these units range in size from 20 to 150 women a conservative esti mate of the total number of women serving on the land this year will be 15,000 but in cluding emergency units and women working in their own locality not joining an agricultural unit the number would greatly exceed that 253 mrs stanley mccormick watch your feet this advice mrs stanley mccormick of boston second vice president of the national american suhrage association and in charge of the department of food production and home economics of the woman’s committee council of national defense gives to women contem plating farm labor the most important part of a farmerette’s uniform is her shoes she says and yet you never hear them discussed don’t ignore footgear you have to have a good spinal column to keep up with a good fob the condition of the spinal column depends greatly upon the feet if you wear improper shoes which throw the body out of balance though you may keep at your job on the form you will not do it so well as with comfortable shoes be picturesque if you wish but also be sensible the english woman adopted for farm work a good stout unlovely boot american women must also wear good stout boots if they want to preserve their health and the health of their race mrs mccormick believes that woman has a definite place to nil in the farm as a laborer she anticipates the recruiting of strong women for this work when asked if by any means the work may be too severe her answer is this there is no work which the women cannot do farm implements will prove too heavy that will not necessarily stop the women it may be possible that some of the those implements can and will probably be simplified to meet the new need then perhaps every body may projit by their alteration figure a remarkable eagerness has been shown everywhere on the part of women to enter the land army recruits have been drawn from every class and from all the professions and occupations as well as from women whose time had been idle the land army has not dis turbed to any extent existing industrial condi tions its workers are drawn from among the women whose time is free during the farming season teachers students seasonal workers it is interesting to note mrs hamilton added that the attitude of farmers in the states where the land army has not been introduced is a very conservative and skeptical one they are slow to accept woman labor until they have been shown that it is worth trying once a unit is established in any state or county the move ment advances by leaps and bounds farmers calling for help from an ever increasing radius kinds of work done by these women most of them wholly untrained at the beginning of the season are many and include tasks which were believed to be quite beyond the powers of a woman farm hand they include haying hoeing corn binding grain shedding wheat rye and oats stocking grain bagging corn cultivating plowing planting thinning and weeding fruit picking and drying potato pick ing canning berry picking pruning and tending and transplanting feeding stock dairy harness ing and driving horses running tractor operat ing binder chopping and sawing wood in doing this work the women have also continued on page 258 254 seven cents or democracy p emocracy is not cheap it never has been blood and treasure almostbeyond count have been spent to win and to keep the precious privilege of the ballot and yet in the long years of their fighting for it the people have not often wanted to turn back they have felt that even at this high price democracy was worth while and they have sacrificed and suffered and died for democracy not because they thought that when they got it it would be a cheaper form of government they knew it would cost more for a whole nation to vote than to have one crowned representative vote for them they knew that congresses and parliaments elected by the people would cost more than congresses and parliaments appointed by a king they also knew from long experience that added cost means added taxes that the only place for a government to get money is from the people they the people were go ing to have to pay the difference and yet they did not for this reason renounce democ racy it seemed worth while even at that price but perhaps none of us knew just how pre cious democracy was to us until germany threatened it now we know that we would sacrihce anything for it that without it life is hardly worth while and yet there comes a new cry from the antilsuffragists that women must not now be enfranchised because the election expenses would be too much and they feel particularly virtuous in urging that the 20,000,000 women of voting age in the united states be denied the franchise in order that some fictitious sum which presumably would have to be spent in providing additional polling places for women be turned into the war this war which we are fighting for democracy and which is se curing this right to vote for both men and women in europe for let us make no mis take one form which the democracy we are winning in europe has already taken is the enfranchisement of women 40,000,000 women in the allied countries granted the franchise within the last three years and we the na tion of all others that boasts democracy accom plished must lag behind because it will cost too much how will our soldiers feel when the war is over if we present to them our con clusion that democracy is all very well to die for but that it is quite too expensive to practice ut let us see what the actual figures are the cost of adding the woman’s vote to that of men take new york where voting costs more than anywhere else the calculation of experts shows that if as many women were added as there were men voting at the last mayoraltyoelection the cost would be lifted from 300,000 to 350,000 or about seven cents each for the women to vote as against the forty three cents each which it has cost for the men to vote this is because women use the polls at different hours from those at which men vote and is also the working out of a per fectly familiar ratio of proportionate decrease in cost as to increase of use or output but it is surely hardly logical for anyone to decide that the seven cents each for the women and not the forty three cents each for the men shall be the limit beyond which the price of democ racy may not go high time l fortunately there are not many men in our democratic world who offer to die for democ racy and then want to save seven cents by re fusing to practice it if there were any such we might present to them the two following observations 1 if in order to win the war we must pour into our war fund the money it would cost to provide voting places for women why not savestill more money by asking men to renounce their franchise and closing up the polls entirely 2 the present and past expenses of elections are and have been paid out of the taxes in paying their taxes women have contributed their full share of cost of men’s voting isn't it time that men be asked to pay their share for women’s voting but it is not alone money that the anti sutfragists boast of saving they are saving the coun try from destruction and they are saving women from politicalburdens and jury duty this is not so much the old boast of incom petence we are not fit to vote saving the country from destruction now means state’s rights an excellent skirt surely for a northern woman to hide behind our allies will come out of the war with democracy accomplished we must wait till the voting enemy alien the slacker the negro have all been converted and graciously conclude that the american woman is to be trusted with the ballot and the american women are also to be saved from political burdens and jury duty not if ohio can help it that anti suffrage state is seriously considering a bill to require women to serve on jury duty not as a privi lege or as a punishment but for the very homely reason that men are scarce and for the same reason the american women whether they want it or not will have to take up their share of the political burdens and in the end they will do it without com plaining even as the anti suffrage voters _league is doing in new york the spirit of democracy is abroad we know that our dream is to be fulfilled nancy m schoonmaker executive secretary department of citizenship connecticut woman suffrage association digitized by gods c the woman citizen in honor

camouflaging the feminine figure so that it shall look like anything from an advanc ing polyhedron to an astral map the designs go twice around the slender lady and tie in the back while they perch upon a single sector of too too solid ayoirdupois woman is naught today unless highly pat terned and since the patterning is being done here is an artistic young person with a soul who is putting much gray matter salt dyes and artis tic education into making designs suggestive of poetry and harmony she is also keen for mak ing the punishment fit the crime or the pattern fit the lady why says she dress up an unsuspecting innocent so that she looks like a vestibule wall paper which has slipped its moor ings and is uncoiling down the street miss ernestine ruprecht of no 44 east 35th street was a supervisor of art before the war she had dyed her own blouses and experimented with color schemes in hats and shoes and scarves and necklaces then the dye shortage began and she turned her attention even more earnestly to home experiments and all the while she belonged to a school of rhythmic ex pression by means of which she was seeking to project her moods into pictures why not into colors she began asking herself color being her metier now she goes right on thinking rhythms which turn into colors with suspicions of design lurking at their depths and she calls them by such names as depths of the sea which is a dream of waves tossing in the sunlight show ing every color from pale green to the purple blues at the bottom of the wave breath of spring is a vision of daffodils and brown earth with pussy willows and tag alders and what design there is carries out all these rhythmic thoughts but the designs have no hard edges they slip from shade to shadow and lose themselves in light a kitchen table rubber gloves some white enamel basins born to more prosaic uses and laundry tubs just at hand are all the outfit this nascent enterprise exacted at first miss ruprecht’s experiments were mainly with such pre wartime fripperies as chiffon scarves and nebulous tea gowns the thingg rhythmic dancers like to float away in 255 fashions for women citizens but she has no intention of confining her work to the perishable stuffs of yesteryear what she claims for her wonderful color schemes is in the first place that every woman can and should adapt the colors she wears to those na ture gave her so that instead of being a dag rant note of inharmony she can blend the tones of her gown into those of her eyes and her skin even such little passing notes of color as but tons beads and tassels may be made to punctuate thoughts in color for that is really what miss ruprecht proclaims the art of thinking colors she is using salt dyes because they will wash making her own blends for after all the art of color thinking is to be an everyday art adapted to working clothes as well as dress up clothes one should not think of bad colors or lifeless cheerless colors at all and certainly not for eight strenuous working hours of every day leaving all the softening harmonies for the few restful moments that are left when one’s zest has flagged why not choose colors which flick life into gladness for mornings as well as even ings for ofiice as well as theatre nd why not use them on cottons and in cheap materials if there are ever to be any cheap materials again that question of plaids for instance who wants to see a plaid ele phant yet every purchaser of ginghams slen der or rotund has been driven this year by the commercial textile world into buying checked dresses plaid

was to make two dollars worth of material spell out a little symphony of pleas ant thoughts there is a little trick of art by which a serviceable skirt can be multiplied by tunics of fascinating differences into a fairy wardrobe given a few utensils a few salt dyes and color sensitiveness what she did as an instinct from the time she was a little girl she has now begun to do as a commercial venture what she hopes to do even more than to make money is to share her gift of color with those too busy to think out color schemes of their own or with less aware ness of their own colorful

world we have lately received several copies of accion feminina the monthly magazine pub lished in spanish by uruguay’s national coun cil of women the leading article of one is sue is headed in english votes for wom en it rejoices over the passage of the suf frage bill in england and expresses the hope that we shall soon hear of the election of a new jeannette rankin to the british parlia ment another article pays tribute to hector mi randa the first member of uruguay’s parlia ment to champion equal rights for women on july 14 1914 he introduced a bill to extend full suffrage to women on the same terms as men and defended it in an eloquent speech the measure was not passed and would have been unconstitutional at that time but under the new constitution adopted since parliament has the power to enfranchise women and the hope is expressed that miranda’s friends and colleagues now mourning his early death will put the reform through a few sentences are quoted from his speech describing women’s po sition under the present uruguayan laws woman is outside of civil society an in ferior being an entity without rights a domes tic animal to vote is the only legal means for her to assert her rights and defend her in terests to deny her the right of suffrage is to refuse her the right of legitimate self defense apparently it is not the custom in uruguay for women to take part in funeral services or memorial meetings but in view of miranda’s well known views on the woman question the national council of women joined in the me morial service at the cemetery and the presi dent of the council doctor paulina luisi made one of the addresses she praised the bril liant young tribune whose voice shook the walls of the ancient dwelling of the viceroys and quoted the words in which he urged the par liament of uruguay to take the lead in adopt ing a measure not only just but above all democratic and human she said his name would be remembered by the women of uru guay as that of john stuart mill is by the women of england and we may add as that of henry b blackwell ought to be by the women of the united states dr baltasar brum is mentioned in passing as a gifted young

women’s period icals of their respective countries accion feminina is published in montivideo and so licits exchanges it brings us much interesting information that we should not get elsewhere a s b a timely book book newly published which has great interest at this time is the birth of the russian democracy by a j sack it is is sued by the russian information bureau at the woolworth building in new york city of which mr sack is director it gives first a history of the progressive movement in russia up to the revolution of march 1917 and then an account of its devel ment since it contains many original docu ments and a vast amount of valuable informa tion it is enriched also with portraits and biographical sketches of a great number of the heroes and heroines of the russian revolution ary movement in the past in reading of these remarkable lines it is impossible not to be thrilled by the courage and devotion shown by such a multitude of men and women hundreds of them ready to pour out their lives like water in the cause of their country’s freedom the women every whit as dauntless as the men there was zinaida konopliannikova a young teacher who shot a general guilty of great barbarities at her trial she said during the cross examination i was asked who gave you the right to kill i ask you in the name of the people who gave you the right to keep us for centuries in ignorance and poverty in prisons and in exile who gave you the right to send us to the gallows and to shoot and kill us by the hundreds the exe cutioner approached her and was about to seize her to lead her over to the scaffold she asked not to be touched and only to be shown how to tighten the loop then she put it on herself very calmly tightened it and herself threw the bench from under her feet you will sentence me to death but wherever i die i shall die with one thought forgive me my people there was so little i could give you digitized by 600816 only my life and i shall die with the firm faith that the day will come when as the poet has it the throne shall topple and the sun of liberty shall arise above the vast plains of russia the oliicial who was reading the sentence could not bear the sight his voice gave way and his hands began to tremble his neighbor snatched the paper from him and hurriedly read it through one of the soldiers fainted and this woman was only one of a great host all likeminded with her recalling the history of the past we can feel sure that the german government will never be able permanently to hold the russian down a scotchman is re ported to have said to the king of spain after lord james of dorylas had fallen in aiding him to drive out the moors be thou strong of heart lord king for this i tell thee sure the sod which drank the douglas blood shall never bear the moor a country where the plant of liberty has been watered by the blood of so many martyrs is in evitably destined to see its eventual blossoming mr sack’s book is of additional value at this time when there is a widespread effort by in terested parties to blacken the russians in american public opinion exaggerating all the follies that they have actually committed and inventing others it is not necessary to agree with all the author’s conclusions to see that his book is rich in interest and information a s b widows who sit in front ow comes a large and scholarly volume to the book table written by two oxford men j vernon bartlett and a j carlyle their christianity in history 0 study of re ligious development shows that women started out in the apostolic church with the same rights to be considered in its councils as had men whether men or women if they were charismatic people that is persons spiritually endowed with gifts of tongues or of heal ing power or of preaching power they were looked upon as natural leaders so divine or supernatural was the commis sion inherent in the gift of prophecy or of spirit prompted prayer both forms of the high er ministry that it overruled even the jewish custom and prejudice against women’s play ing a public part with men paul allows this form of woman’s participation in church while disallowing the more normal ones the widows who sit in front say these oxford scholars in some parts of the east ranked as female presbyters and so within the priesthood it was not until the third century that the tendency to lower the dignity of widows and presbyteresses and deaconesses prevailed therewith these gentlemen would have the world know anything like equality between the sexes in the church’s ministry vanished and so far has revived only in very limited circles in modern times ministry of women in the church to an extent adequate to the idea of christianity and even to early christian practice is still a thing of the future it may mark a fresh era in the spiritualixation of hu maniiy august 24 1918 in the professions ut in ohio the woman preacher dea has penetrated the presbyterian fold long the most literal inter preter of the let your women keep silence in the churches doctrine miss minnie ellet is reported by the akron beacon journal as having carried the banner of women’s equal rights as preacher fairly into the ministerial camp as long as women were being allowed to vote in many states and to be elected to legis latures and congress and to make gas masks and to plow corn and to practice law and medi cine and write for the newspapers why shouldn’t they be given equal rights in church as well the right to sit in at meetings of vestry and boards of deacons and even to preach if need be she asked she went to headquarters she wrote to the new moderator of the general assembly of the presbyterian church of america a south erner rev j frank smith of dallas texas and dr smith’s reply sent minnie hustling in from old springfield with the glad tidings for he went clear across for suerage here is his letter the city temple 1 frank smith pastor dallas texas june 18 1918 minnie j ellet east akron ohio my dear friend your communications reached me and i read them with joy i am very sympathetic toward woman’s work and place on this little clod of ours nothing is too good for her i am in favor of her voting preaching and doing anything else that needs to be done around her father’s house and in her father’s world if she wants to be a soldier and put the kaiser to flight it might be embarrassing to some of us men but i’m satisfied the kaiser would be more embarrassed some of these days the presby terian church is going to do what you say put woman side by side with her brother in all the work of the kingdom with best wishes for you in your work i am very truly yours 1 frank smith upon receipt of this letter miss ellet wrote as follows to the woman citizen my dears when i sent you a copy of my 1916 letter to general assembly commis sioners for endorsement of the suffrage reso lution it went through swimmingly i told you i’d keep right on until presbyterians put woman on equal footing with man in church i think i’m advancing one sentence i wrote cleveland ministers was this woman has known more than one ungodly man to hold the sacred otiice of ruling elder she remembers that the mother of every minister and elder is a woman she knows that the most godly of women may be ordained neither elder nor minister and she wonders if presbyterian doctrines hold ungodly men superior to godly women one d d s amazing reply was that he had always opposed women’s having spiritual rule because she was so much man’s superior spiritually that were she allowed to serve as elder or trustee she’d soon place the male mem the woman i preacher bers in such a state of humiliation that finally no men could be found to serve with her that this was not pleas antry that he had women in prayer meet ing that even elders could not be per suaded to take part when these women were present is he right yes and no women are men’s superiors spiritually because god intended man and woman to march side by side neither one superior nor inferior to the other man in his desire to dominate placed the twain in the position of driver and driven unconsciously putting himself in the rear and only as brave christian women have taken the bits in their teeth and dragged men whither he would not has he kept any of his god given spirituality but the doctor’s logic is faulty how can the great presbyterian church or any other church expect to grow spiritually if only the less spiritual side have any ruling voice i sent all this and much more to dr smith i told him

journal a journal of democracy august 3 1918 w e shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts for jennaaey for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government the suffrage spirit omething over a month ago a few wilful senators tried to block the progress of suffrage in america by talking against time in the united states senate they knew then as they know now that they could not vitally impair the suffrage offensive but they saw a chance to tangle it up in talk so they talked other important war measures besides suffrage hung in the balance awaiting the senate’s attention but the senators talked on talked until they talked the fed eral suffrage amendment into a corner and left it there enmeshed in language they knew that it was a futile procedure they knew that the federal suffrage amend ment must eventually drive through the thickest talk fest that senatorial garrulity can devise but they shut their eyes to the inevitable and enjoyed their own verbosity while they could today in spite of all that waste of language the federal suffrage amendment is out of the corner and awaiting the senators on the threshold the moment the congressional quasi recess is over there it stands just as demandant as ever just as alive as ever and more certain than ever you see there is something back of the federal suf rage amendment it is the suffrage spirit it is far more powerful than talk it has survived a great deal of talk along with decayed eggs and stones this number of the woman citizen commemorates the centennial of a great woman pioneer lucy stone she was one of those in whom the suffrage spirit fiamed incarnate it informed and steeled her slender body while the eggs came and the stones descended from her day to this the suffrage spirit has flamed on and though talk fiat talk like that of senator reed or senator underwood or senator brandegee or mrs wadsworth’s husband on the subject of suffrage is a severer trial than any eggs or stones could ever have been the suffrage spirit endures still afiame forgetful of each and every temporary set back it renews itself and starts forth afresh on stronger wings because of it speaking through the voice of mrs guilford dudley a vice president and one of the prime spokes women of the national american woman suffrage association you find today all florida aglow for suffrage mass meetings are being held in city after city candidate after candidate for florida’s offices is catching the contagion and declaring for suffrage be cause of it you find tennessee today agog with suffrage interest its press agitating suffrage its people keen it is the suffrage spirit again finding expression in a great state organization led by mrs leslie warner in south dakota in oklahoma in michigan women and men for the matter of that are out in these august days campaigning for suffrage standing discomforts for suffrage urging and pushing and compelling their states into the suffrage fold the suffrage spirit again in texas that spirit has triumphed at the polls so glori ously that a glad wire has just girdled the earth with the vibrant news texas women sweep to victory every candidate endorsed by the women winll that texas news but lends pith and point to the fact that here and there and everywhere across the country candidates are springing up in the impending congres sional elections in opposition to the opponents of the federal suffrage amendment antis who have held uncontested seat in the senate saddle for years suddenly discover rivals for place this autumn and they won der and then make another discovery in each case the rival has declared for the federal suffrage amend ment and never far away stands some group of women quiet watchful inscrutable truly the hands of women are not tied as once they were tied and the suffrage spirit can operate more quickly and more surely than once it could it has suffered long and eagerly the suffrage spirit now it fares forth conqueringly there is no with standing it it is the crusading spirit it never accepts defeat it marches straight on to victory it is far better to march with it than against it digitized by 600816 186 the woman citizen the appeal of democracy his article does not pretend to be a philo sophical treatise or an historical sketch of the democratic party all that can be done within its limits is to set forth some of the achievements of the party and of this admin istration which have a special interest for the women of this country with the beginning of the new century in its 1900 platform the democratic party adopted this plank we favor an amendment to the federal constitution providing for the election of united states senators by the direct vote of the people and we favor direct legislation wherever prac ticable both of these reforms at once enlisted the sympathies of many women the newly enfran chised woman usually turns her attention to leg islation that being the field where most is ex pected of her sometimes she is able to accom plish the changes she desires but not infre quently she fails and every such failure be comes an argument in favor of direct legisla tion women also learned long ago that the leg islature which had a united states senator to elect seldom accomplished much else if there was a contest for the senatorship when this change in the election of senators was actually brought about in 1913 it was heralded as the greatest political reform of the last half century and their legislative experience made women especially enthusiastic in its praise it was the first great step in the program of placing the powers of government in the hands of the peo ple themselves and the second was like unto it the revolt against the autocratic powers of the speaker culminated in the election of a democratic house in 1910 at that time and for years the speaker of the house of representatives had control of the entire machinery of legislation in that body n 0 one could get a hearing with out his consent the democratic house amended its rules taking away these arbitrary powers and providing for a calendar committee represent ing both parties and all sections of the coun try since then fair play has displaced the autocracy which had so long dominated the lower house of congress he third reform was also purely political but when rules were adopted by the in coming congress in 1917 by which the horde of lobbyists was driven out of the capitol the congress of the united states was freed from influences which had long hampered its useful ness these three radical changes in methods cleared the decks for action and made it pos sible to put through the legislation that has made the last six years notable it may seem strange to speak first of the child labor law which has been held unconstitutional but the simple fact is that a bill of this nature had been introduced in several congresses and had died with them while waiting for a respon sive congress and a courageous chief executive to make it a law the court which set the act aside commends the purpose of the law and other bills drawn with the objections of the court in view are now pending more than that last year there was promul gated what is known as general order no 13 it deserves to be called the great charter of american labor and it sets standards which by ellis meredith when you have been a voter as long as i have you get away from the non voting point of view and i think my view represent those of _a great many women employers must observe if they expect to re ceive government contracts it covers the main features of the child labor law and in brief makes the following requirements governing the employment of women and children and sets similar standards for men no employment of minors under 14 years of age no employment of children under 16 more than 8 hours a day an eight hour day for women wherever pos sible saturday half holiday one day of rest in seven avoidance of night work and overtime no tenement house work avoidance of extreme temperatures in work rooms adequate light ventilation and sanitation protection against fire industrial fatigue disease and accident adequate time for rest and meals a place to eat outside the workroom equal pay for equal work wages commensurate with increased cost of living mothers of young children in the home rather than in industry co operation of employer and employe ll this is in line with the legislation that fixed the eight hour day for all govern ment employes for all employes of contractors doing government work for women employes in the district of columbia and for railroad men throughout the nation the farm loan law excites only a languid in terest in states where money can be obtained at 5 per cent but in the far west it has been a veritable emancipation proclamation to thou sands of farmers who lived in dread of losing their farms through inability to keep up exor bitant rates of interest the fact that in the first year of its operation some 50,000 farmers borrowed one hundred million dollars much of which was expended in taking up existing mort gages is sufiicient evidence that this law was actually needed another act much appreciated by country peo ple is the agricultural extension law which brings the advantages of scientific education to farmers and their families teaching them how to get the best results and relieving farm work of much of its drudgery the good roads act like the agricultural extension law works on the principle of federal aid for state enterprise and under its provisions thousands of miles of turnpike have been con structed these two measures designed to in crease the output of farms and the facility of marketing products are great socializing agencies and steps in preparedness for the present war conditions whose value can hardly be overestimated there are no sectional limitations upon the blessings brought by the federal reserve act vhen a man loses all he has his feelings are conti it’d on page 197 digiiized by google much the same whether he does business in wall street or tin cup colorado in 1907 a few men had the power to precipitate a panic and did not hesitate to use it the world has been at war since august 1914 but there has been no financial fiurry since the passage of the federal reserve law hen war abroad brought consternation to thousands of business men and in surance rates for goods to be shipped abroad began to soar the administration assumed the risks issued insurance at reasonable rates paid all losses and found it financially profitable these are plain concrete instances of the way in which this administration has brought the benefits of government to the people the con structive program has been somewhat inter rupted by our entrance into the war but the same general policy has been pursued con scription is a hateful word to american ears yet there is an innate spirit‘of fairness that makes reasonable persons admit that part of the sons of america should not bear the brunt of her battles the selective draft is the fairest way ever devised to raise a great army quickly and it has been accepted in that spirit by the american people having called her sons to the colors columbia has made such provision for them and those they leave behind as was never dreamed of before the soldier can take out from 1,000 to 10,000 insurance specifying the beneficiary in case of his death or it may help to rehabilitate him if he returns disabled or serve as a nest egg to give him a new start in life realizing that many men were leaving dependents the government provides that the wife of the private receiving 30 per month shall receive half of it and 15 more as a separation allowance if there are children this is increased if the soldier receives a larger amount he is expected to give half to his family if he is injured or discharged or dies the allotments and allowances cease and the compensation and insurance features become operative nothing could do more to preserve the morale of the army than this knowledge that the loved ones are provided for and it has done much to keep the fires of courage burning at home ut the government has not stopped at morale it insists upon morals and a high standard of conduct evils which had existed so long that they have been accepted as ineradicable are finding their day of judgment several prohibitory measures have been passed in regard to liquor and red light districts have been ordered to clear out rather than to clean up most women would be content to know that their sons were brave and good but columbia is more ambitious the draft called many men who could neither read nor write english some of them were of foreign parentage and some from regions where truancy laws are unknown they are receiving an elementary education the questionnaire filled out by all men of draft age was drawn with the intention that it might help them to find their sphere of usefulness in civilian life if they were not called to serve in uniform it seems indeed a fitting supplement to the system of vocational education estab lished by a law signed by the president in feb ruary 1917 august 3 1918 mrs louis reed welzmiller emocratic women and republican women of the empire state have within the past fortnight taken part in the unofficial political conventions of their parties both con ventions were held in saratoga and within five days of each other both were distinguished by being the first state party convention since the women of new york state were enfran chised expectations were on tiptoe all over the state and especially among men politicians as to what women would do and on the main political leaders were eager to find out what would please the new voters and do it what happened at the republican convention was reported in the woman citizen of july 27 what happened at the democratic convention may be gathered from the account below women were numercially represented in both conventions in about the proportional strength of their party enrollment one hundred and fifty women were reported present among the republicans and 103 among the democrats the state enrollment of women having given to re publicans 375,093 and to democrats 247,676 in one respect only was there a noticeable difference between the conventions women delegates from new york city represented the organized suffragists less at the democratic than at the republican convention women present july 23 were picked by the men as sembly district leaders and few prominent suffragists were among them mrs charles l tiffany mrs louis reed welzmiller former director of the woman suffrage party for bronx borough and some assembly district leaders in the last campaign were noticeable as representing the new york city women who had fought long and tirelessly for the privileges women are now enjoying this was not generally true of up state women however miss harriet maerills one of the most influential sut’fragists of the state and a former president of the new york state woman suffrage association and mrs francis h lamon of watertown were among the up state contingent mrs tiffany whose summer home is at oyster bay long island was one of the democratic delegation from nassau county 187 democrats in convention miss kathryn starbuck of saratoga an active leader in the two new york state cam paigns for the vote was a member of the plat form committee of which senator robert e wagner was chairman on the platform committee also were five other democratic women among them mrs edwin s jenney of syracuse miss may pat terson and mrs elizabeth barry of brooklyn mrs welzmiller also was promptly made chairman of the permanent committee on organ ization and the convention as it were waited hat in hand to know what next it should do to be fair to the new electorate just here is where a revealing instance of the spirit that is in women who have fought for the vote was manifested mrs tiffany was approached at once by a no less prominent leader than senator robert wagner and asked if she would accept a posi tion in the convention miss mary garrett hay had been chairman of the platform committee at the republican convention in saratoga the previous week it is a matter of history that the new york democrats have shown a finely hospitable spirit towards the new women voters and if no woman was honored by a chairmanship in the democratic convention at saratoga charge it not to men’s fault but to the women’s judgment a chairmanship was offered to mrs tiffany by a committee composed of mr charles e murphy mr norman mack mr thomas smith and mr thomas foley it was the po sition of permanent chairman of the convention rs tiffany declined the nomination her answer is a classic and should be known by all politicians and all timorous souls who fear women will stampede all the political offices in sight it defines with exactness the spirit of a large group of women in the suffrage cause she said acceptance of this office would serve no purpose but to establish the fact that the dem ocrats of new york state are as generous to wards new women voters as are the repub licans i could not acceptably fill the position since i am not yet suliiciently familiar with state leaders to recognize them as they rise and this kind of attention is not what we women want the time will come and soon when some women will be prepared as some men are now prepared to'engineer a big political party through a convention like this one we have had a large experience in organization in our campaign for the vote but we are not at all eager for positions given us just because we are women and least of all do we want frills we want to be put on your deliberative bodies and on your administrative councils we want to help shape the policies of this state which is dear to us we want to work we account opportunities for service sutiicient honor nhen it was suggested that women be put upon the ticket for state offices mrs tiffany held firmly to her no frills argument not because we are women do we want anything she reiterated but because we are fitted certain state otiices mrs tiffany hoped might be given to women offices for which women’s previous training had especially fitted them but she voiced the opinion of most of the women in the state when she held to the prin ciple that women were not there to seek office but to serve the state of new york and in cidentally to serve at a critical period of the world’s history miss starbuck and miss sara mcpike of yonkers are among the new york democratic women spoken of for positions on the ticket t had long been on the cards that the national suffrage cause would receive consideration by the new york state democrats national committeeman norman mack whose wife was one of the active leaders in the suffrage cause in buffalo where suffrage polled a big victory in 1917 had announced himself for the federal woman suffrage amendment in mr mack’s paper the buffalo times an editorial appeared calling on both senators to vote for the amendment and saying that universal woman suffrage is one of the imme diate certainties of civilization therefore it was in line that a large part of the declaration of principles of the democratic party should concern itself with the political emancipation of all american women this plank followed the fifteen specified ques tions upon which new york state democrats are determined to wage their campaign this fall and reads as follows we welcome women voters to the electorate and we confidently invite them to join the dem ocratic party upon its record we believe in equal suffrage without regard to sex and we recognize that the present influence when our nation is engaged in a great war for equal rights and individual freedom is a time pe culiarly appropriate for its adoption by the peo ple of the united states we therefore urge the immediate adoption by the united states senate of the concurrent resolution amending the constitution so as to confer the right of suffrage upon woman we demand that the united states senators from new york represent their constituents by vot ing for the proposed suffrage amendment continued on page 192 still flirting eventng telegram 188 the woman citizen they are for it what the press says n the month of june 810 suffrage editorials mostly on the federal suffrage amendment were returned by press clipping bureaus to the desk of the chairman on editorial correspond ence of the leslie woman suffrage commis sion mrs ida husted harper the clipping bureaus are ordered to return anti suffrage as well as suffrage comments yet out of the 810 editorials there were only five opposed to suffrage what governors say t this time when people all over the coun try are interested in the fate of the federal suffrage amendment in the senate a message from the governor of idaho where suffrage has been tried for many years is especially timely governor alexander says idaho has repeatedly declared itself on the question of woman suffrage after twenty years of trial there is no difference of opinion among our people on that question and we recognize our women as our equals since the beginning of the war we have valued their services and co operation more than ever it is the women who furnish sons to fight the battles of the nation and to bleed and die for liberty and civilization and their sacrifices should entitle them to every consideration and bestow upon them political and civil rights of equality with men idaho is unanimous for equality of men and women before the law in every question that interests humanity overnor thomas c rye of ten nessee in the opening speech of his cam paign for the democratic nomination for united states senator delivered before a large audi ence at chattanooga july 8 affirmed his belief in suerage for women to the women whose political enfranchise ment our great president has given assurance of his support said governor rye i would accord this rightful privilege so long withheld and to which they have proven their right by their intelligent patriotic and hearty support of every war activity and every worthy cause hon clyde shrapshire in his opening ad dress as a candidate for governor of the state on the democratic ticket also came out strongly for equal suffrage what mothers say n o greater appeal no stronger argument could have been advanced for the passage of the federal amendment than that embodied in the petition now being circulated in philadel phia to be presented to senator penrose the petition reads we the undersigned women of philadelphia county pennsylvania having gladly released all claim upon our sons daughters brothers nephews and other near relatives in order that they may be free to serve their country in its hour of need do hereby earnestly appeal to you for your aid in securing the passage of the federal amendment for woman suffrage to the end that we may be fully equipped to de fend the interests of that democracy at home for which they are fighting abroad every suffragist in philadelphia with sons daughters or relatives in the service will have an opportunity to sign this petition it was on motion of mrs george a piersol congressional district chairman of group i that the central committee of the woman suffrage party of philadelphia voted to circulate the petition and mrs piersol leads the list of sign ers following her name are the significant words four sons and one daughter in the united states service the pennsylvania suffragists have devoted much time to war service among the special features was an outdoor dance and midway held at pittsburgh the last of june to stimulate the sale of war savings stamps and raise a recrea tion fund for soldiers mrs clarence renshaw was general chairman of the affair and the women did all the work in preparing the mid way including the carpentering admission to everything was by thrift stamps the suffrage section of the patriotic parade held at harrisburg on the fourth of july was featured by floats and formations which de picted suffrage progress mrs j sherman mac donald was general chairman qf this demonstra tion being assisted by miss helen c clark congressional district chairman and miss annie laurie the suffragists will take an active part in the fourth liberty loan drive mrs john 0 mil ler president of the pennsylvania woman suf frage party has been appointed state chairman of the woman’s committee for the fourth liberty loan what women doctors say t a joint meeting of the chicago medical woman’s club and the chicago woman’s bar association in july a petition was circu lated asking the senate to pass the suffrage amendment and forty eight signatures were secured that being all present who had not signed it before the petition was unanimously endorsed by resolution of the assembly a resolution was endorsed asking the citizens of nevada to elect miss anne martin to the office of senator what the west says by senator miles poindexter he entire west is intensely interested in the outcome of the vote in the senate on the amendment to the constitution giving women the right to vote the western states have long since overcome the prejudices which heretofore have discriminated against women in the suffrage the states themselves have long since recognized women as equal partners in the state as well as in business and in the homes vith us it has ceased to be an experi ment and most of the anti suffrage arguments based upon theory and dire prophecy have no effect in the face of realities in the western states women have the right to vote and do vote and exercise the most wholesome influence in public affairs i think it is safe to say that many of the most excel lent policies now in force in the western states would not have been adopted without woman suffrage hard headed business men immersed in material affairs without much time or desire to give to political speculation who bitterly opposed many of these new measures simply 4 5 digitized by 6 because they were unaccustomed to them are now just as strongly in favor of them in other words there is universal approval of measures which the good sense and sound feel ing of women carried into effect t has been discovered much to the surprise of ultra conservatives that the suerage has not in any respect changed the nature of women although it has given them a new dig nity and power women anti suffragists especially have argued that women would be spoiled by politics nothing of the kind has happened in the west in the first place com paratively few women are in politics in any other sense than that of taking a keen and intelligent interest in public questions and vot ing their convictions upon them to do this has not required any displacement of woman in her domestic or other relations as a matter of fact the wholesomest and best place for the formation of public opinion is the family circle it is the real foundation of our insti tutions anyhow it is here that papers maga zines and other sources of information are read and discussed in a sane and normal way under conditions which tend towards freedom of judgment and intelligent decision vomen of course as well as men have various oppor tunities as they always did of meeting with their neighbors and exchanging views and so adding to their stock of information and to their ability to form a correct judgment the further act of registering this judgment in a vote is after all when one sees it in opera tion not such a difficult complicated affair and not at all the horrible bugaboo which has been pictured our polling places are decent places they were so before women voted and they are more emphatically so since they have voted under the australian ballot system the greatest care is taken to protect the indepen dence and privacy of the voter the exercise of the suffrage has been with us always a serious if not solemn function we appreciate its privileges and its importance and this feel ing is reflected in conditions at the polling places which are orderly quiet and fit places for men to go with their wives or for women to go together or alone and to retire to the booth for marking their ballots suffice it to say that many years experience in many of the states has confirmed our deep conviction not only of the justice but of the value not only to women but to the entire community of woman suffrage we are in tensely expectant and hopeful of a favorable result of the senate vote on the national amendment what wisconsin says 0 many entries were made in the essay con test instituted by the wisconsin womani suffrage association that it has taken weeks to i decide the winner why this congress should i pass the suffrage amendment was the subject of the essays and the first prize was awarded to miss blanche fleming a student in the nau kesha high school some high school

citizenship which the united states has granted freely to the foreign born men of every allied and neutral nation is indicated by two incidents noted and commented upon by presidents of the suffrage associations of wisconsin and indiana mrs theodora youmans president of visconsin has sent to the woman citizen the following appreciative account of the milwaukee cere monial which welcomed newly naturalized citizens five hundred and ninety newly naturalized citizens of milwaukee their wives and children were guests of honor at a'great reception held in the auditorium in milwaukee on the even

showed the american flag on the cover and the names of the 590 men other groups of the foreign born by nationalities greeks poles bohemians etc made a dramatic appearance as they marched in to band

the affair was arranged by the americanization committee of milwaukee of which mrs a m simons is chairman mrs simons is one of the active members of the milwaukee county woman suffrage association drive for 100,000 new members has been launched in indiana by the woman’s franchise league under the chairmanship of mrs fred h mccullock of fort wayne mrs richard e edwards president of the franchise league is convinced suffrage is a war measure as are the 1,500 officers of the league to whom she sent the following open letter to win the war is our immediate necessity to win it the quickest biggest most enduring way to win it for the benefit of all people for all time and in the winning of this war so to advance the cause of humanity and progress that all our sacrifices need not be in vain you know as every suffragist knows that the cause of suffrage is closely linked with every hope of real democracy with every idea of real progress we all believe that en franchisement of women on equal terms with men is an actual war measure our allies have found it so and enfranchised their women or are definitely planning to it is time to make false the statement now true that the united states is the only english speaking nation in the world whose women are not enfranchised you have given yourself to war work give now your time and your energies for the month of august to this branch of war work the pushing of the federal suffrage amendment you will find your work made easy by the change of public opinion sentiment for suffrage was never so strong as today officers of the dallas

canvasses that women have made they have found so many women who want to buy bonds war savings stamps and red cross memberships but have not a cent of their own we could serve our country better if we

celebrated on august 13th has been called the morning star of the woman’s rights movement other women before her had spoken occasionally for this cause while devoting themselves mainly to other radical subjects but she was the first and for a long time the only lecturer who made it her specialty and who traveled all up and down the country preaching it year after year with an almost magical eloquence in the words of elizabeth cady stanton lucy stone was the first person by whom the heart of the american public was widely and deeply stirred on the woman question she was born august 13 1818 on a farm near west brookfield mass the daughter of francis stone and hannah matthews she was a dc scendant of that deacon gregory stone who in 1664 with three others presented to the general court of massachusetts a largely signed memo rial protesting against the proposed government of new england by a royal commission not chosen by the people her great grandfather fought in the french and indian war her grandfather was an officer in the war of the revolution her father was a prosperous farmer much respected but fully believing like most men of his day in the right of husbands to rule over their wives her mother was an excellent christian woman who submitted conscientiously little lucy grew up a healthy vigorous child noted for fearlessness and truthfulness a good scholar and a hard worker in the house and on the farm sometimes driving the cows bare footed by starlight before the sun was up when the dew was so cold that she would stop on a flat stone and curl one small bare foot up against the other to warm it the mother milked eight cows the night before lucy was born and said when informed of the sex of the new baby oh dear i am sorry it is a girl a woman’s life is so hard he little girl early became indignant at the way she saw her mother and other women treated by their husbands and by the laws and made up her mind that those laws must be changed reading the bible one day while still a child she came upon the text thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee at first she wanted to die then she determined to go to college study greek and hebrew and satisfy herself whether such texts were correctly translated she was the first massachusetts woman to take a college degree her brothers had gone to college but when her father heard of her wish to do likewise he said is the child crazy she picked berries and chestnuts and sold them to buy books for years she taught district schools studying and teaching by turns at mt holyoke academy which she attended for a time she was held up as an example for the spotless neatness of her plain print dresses and white collars she soon became known as a successful teacher once she was engaged to teach a winter school which had been broken up by the big boys throwing the master headforemost out of the window into a deep snowdrift as a rule women were not thought competent to teach in winter because then the big boys were released from farm work and were able to attend in a few days she had this dillicult school in perfect order and the big boys who had made the trouble became her most devoted lieutenants yet she received only a fraction of the salary paid to her unsuccessful predecessor at the low wages given to women teachers it took her nine years to earn the money to carry her to oberlin ohio then the only college in the country that admitted women crossing lake erie from buffalo to cleveland she could not afford a stateroom but slept on deck on a pile of grainsacks among horses and freight with a few other women who like herself could pay for only a deck passage t oberlin she earned her way by teaching in the preparatory department of the college and by doing housework in the ladies board ing hall at three cents an hour most of the students were poor and the college furnished them board at a dollar a week but she could not afford even this small sum and during most of her course she cooked her food in her own room boarding herself at less than fifty cents a week she kept healthy and happy distinguished herself in her studies and found time in addition for good works her first public speech was made during her college course the colored people got up a celebration of the anniversary of west indian emancipation and asked her to speak together with the college president and some of the professors the next day she was summoned before the ladies board made up of the pro fessors wives they represented to her that it was unwomanly and unscriptural for her to speak in public the president’s wife said did you not feel yourself very much out of place up there on the platform among all those men were you not embarrassed and fright ened why no mrs mahan she answered those men were president mahan and my professors whom i meet every day in the classroom i was not afraid of them at alll at oberlin she met antoinette l brown who was to become the first ordained woman min ister the two girls soon formed a friendship which was cemented later by their marrying brothers the young men of the class had to hold de bates as part of their college work the young women were not allowed to debate but were required to attend so as to help form an audi ence for the boys lucy was intending to lecture and antoinette to preach they asked to be allowed to debate the professor in that department was liberal and consented tradition says the debate was a brilliant one but the faculty at once forbade any repetition omen must keep silence lucy persuaded an old colored woman who owned a small house to give the occasional use of her parlor to the girls who wanted to debate coming by ones and twos so as not to attract attention she and antoinette and others would gather there and discuss all sorts of deep sub jects sometimes in summer they held their meetings in the woods this was the first debating club ever formed among college girls at her graduation she was appointed to write an essay to be read at commencement but was notified that one of the professors would have to read it for her as it would not be proper for a woman to read her own essay in public rather than not to read it herself she declined to ever spoke public bef e and curiosity drew digitized by 6008 c 1 __ the woman citizen the centennial of by her alice

gathering she was graduated in 1847 and gave her first woman’s rights lecture in the same year soon after she was engaged to lecture regularly for the anti slavery society she mixed a great deal of woman’s rights with her anti slavery lectures finally the rev samuel may the agent of the anti slavery society who arranged her meetings felt obliged to tell her that on the anti slavery platform this would not do she answered i know it but i could not help it i was a woman before i was an abolitionist and i must speak for the women she resigned her position but the abolitionists persuaded her to continue speaking for them saturday evenings and sundays times re garded as too sacred for a woman’s rights meet ing while the rest of the week she lectured for woman’s rights on her own responsibility er adventures during the next ten years would fill a volume no suffrage associa tion was organized until long after this time she had no co operation and no backing and started out absolutely alone she put up the posters for her own meetings with a little package of tacks and a stone picked up from the street sometimes the boys followed her hooting and preparing to tear the posters down then she would call the boys about her and hold a pre liminary meeting in the street until she had won them all over and persuaded them to let her posters alone once in winter a pane of glass was removed from the window a hose was put through and she was deluged with ice cold water while speaking she put on her shawl and continued her lecture pepper was burned spitballs and eggs were thrown once a hymn book was hurled at her head with stun ning force but she almost always ended by gaining her hearers hearts she traveled over a large part of the united states in most of the places no woman had te te so wt nh df r lt august 3 1918 daughter blackwell the first massachusetts woman to take a college degree immense audiences they expected to see a tall gaunt angular person with aggressive manners and a strident voice they found a small quiet woman gentle and winning with the sweetest voice ever possessed by a public speaker he had a wonderful eloquence her trans parent simplicity sincerity and intense earnestness added to a singular personal mag netism and a complete forgetfulness of self swayed those great audiences as the wind bends a field of grass often mobs would listen to her when they howled down every other speaker at one woman’s rights meeting in new york the mob made such a clamor that no speaker could be heard one after another tried it only to have their voices drowned forthwith by boots and howls the rev william henry charming advised lucretia mott who was pre siding to adjourn the meeting she answered when the hour fixed for adjournment comes i will adjourn the meeting not before at last lucy stone was introduced the mob became as quiet as a congregation of church goers but as soon as the next speaker began the howling recommenced and it continued to the end after the meeting when the speakers went into the dressing room to get their hats and cloaks the mob surged in and surrounded them and lucy who was brimming over with indignation began to reproach them for their behavior oh come they answered you needn’t say anything we kept still for you at an anti slavery meeting held on cape cod in a grove a platform had been erected for the speakers and a crowd assembled but a crowd so menacing in aspect and with so evident an intention of violence that the speak ers one by one came down from the stand and slipped quietly away till only lucy stone and stephen foster were left she said you had better run stephen they are coming he answered but who will take care of you at that moment the mob made a rush and a big man grasping a club sprang upon the plat form lucy turned to him and said without a great pioneer hesitation this gentleman will take care of me he declared that he would he tucked her under one arm and holding his club with the other marched her out through the crowd who were roughly handling mr foster and such of the other speakers as they had been able to catch her representations finally so prevailed upon him that he mounted her on a stump and stood by her with his club while she addressed the mob they were so moved by her speech that they not only desisted from further violence but took up a collection of twenty dollars to pay stephen foster for his coat which they had torn to pieces hen she began to lecture she would not charge an admission fee partly because she was anxious that everyone should hear and be converted and she feared that a door fee might keep someone away partly from some thing of the quaker feeling that it was wrong to take pay for preaching the gospel she econo mized in every way when she stayed in boston she used to put up at a lodging house on hanover street where they gave her meals for twelve and a half and lodging for six and a quarter cents on condition of her sleeping with the daughters of the house three in a bed once when she was in great need of a new cloak she came to salem mass where she was to lecture and found that the hutchinson family of singers were to give a concert the same evening they proposed to her to unite the entertainments and divide the proceeds she consented and bought a cloak with the money she was also badly in want of other clothing her friends assured her that the audiences would be just as large despite an admission fee she tried it and finding that the audi ences continued to be as large as the halls would hold she continued to charge a door fee and was no longer reduced to such straits in 1850 she headed the call for the first national woman’s rights convention held at worcester mass the first local convention had been held at seneca falls new york in 1848 this great meeting attracted wide at tention and the report of it led mrs taylor afterwards mrs john stuart mill to write her famous article in the westminster review which began the modern movement for woman suffrage in england the annual national woman’s rights conventions from that time to 1855 were organized mainly by lucy and she published their proceedings each year in pamphlet form at her own expense on may 1 1855 she married henry b black well a young merchant of cincinnati ohio a brother of dr elizabeth blackwell the first woman to take a medical degree he was a strong woman’s rights man and abolitionist highly gifted both as a speaker and a writer he had attended a hearing before a committee of the massachusetts constitutional convention of 1853 when lucy stone wendell phillips and others spoke for suffrage and he had made up his mind then to marry her if he could she had meant never to marry but to devote herself wholly to her work he promised to devote himself to the same work and persuaded her that together they could do more for it than she could alone that promise was most loyally kept from that time on they were co workers 191 in the movement he gave to it not only his high talents but much needed financial help the wedding ceremony was performed by the rev thomas wentworth higginson who later went into the army and is better remem bered as col higginson the bride and groom drew up a joint protest against the disabilities which the laws at that time imposed on mar ried women it was widely published and helped to get those injustices corrected she regarded the loss of a wife’s name at marriage as a symbol of the loss of her indi viduality she was told by eminent lawyers including the hon salmon p chase later chief justice of the united states that there was no law requiring a wife to take her hus band’s name it was only a custom with her husband’s full approval she kept her own name and continued to be called by it during nearly forty years of faithful and affectionate married life she signed all legal documents lucy stone wife of henry b blackwell n 1857 while they were living in orange n 1 she let her household goods be seized and sold for taxes one of the articles taken was the baby’s cradle and she wrote a protest against taxation without representation with the baby on her knee for a few years she dropped public work almost entirely and de voted herself to her child then she resumed it and kept it up untiringly till her death but without neglecting either husband or daughter in 1866 she helped to organize the american equal rights association and was chairman of its executive committee in 1869 with julia w'ard howe mary a livermore col higgin son william lloyd garrison george william curtis and others she organized the american woman suffrage association and was chair man of its executive committee for nearly twenty years when the national and the american associations came together and formed the national american she was chair man of the executive committee of the united society she always craved not the post of prominence but the post of work she and her husband took an active part in organizing the massachusetts woman suffrage association in 1870 and she raised most of the money with which the woman journal was started in boston in the same year mrs liver more was its first editor with lucy stone julia ward howe higginson and garrison as editorial contributors at the end of two years mrs livermore resigned the editorship mrs stone and mr blackwell took it up and carried that burden to the end of their lives the 47 years existence of the journal a life time unprecedented for a reform paper was due mainly to their efforts and to the interest that they aroused and inspired lucy stone was chairman of the executive committee also of the new england woman suffrage association for a generation the suffrage work of massachusetts and new eng land and a large part of that throughout the whole country centred in her home and in the woman's journal ofiice and radiated out from it she took part in the early campaigns

in three weeks they raised 1,680 all under fourteen these children cut grass cleaned cel lars and sold junk one little girl a graduate of cortelyou came back and offered to give up a week’s vacation to make and sell a special kind of raisin bread every noon at 12 o’clock through a very hot week she trudged in flushed and heated carry ing her orders of bread finally earning 18 the children earned their money singly and they earned it by classes nothing could stop them once they were started on their campaign some of them offered to go without desserts for a whole year if their parents would advance them the money the desserts would cost the graduating glass gave up flowers or gifts for the sake of the fund one class made and sold ribbon pins of the allies colors another made red cross knitting bags then the whole school gave a cake sale we are talking now about the days when people spoke of cake above a whisper and there was no ban on sugar the cake sale started out as an affair of a few tables it grew to a corner on mugs u i 1 i i i l h illustrations by eleanor middleditch the cake market it became a cake rout some one sent a hurry call to the assistant principal of the school telling her she’d better come down and look after her cake sale for it was swamp ing the city when she arrived the cakes were coming coming in platoons coming in brigades coming in regiments those in charge took in cakes hand over hand like a sailor taking in sail they set them on tables under the tables behind the tables and still they came 400 worth and all sold inside of three hours one mother said earnestly i gave my very best i put eleven eggs in that cake think of it but that was a year ago in 1917 before it was said that a frosted cake is an affair for martial law who could have an eleven egg cake or any cake at all in 1918 when the money was all raised dr fiske of the king’s county hospital unit who was to take the ambulance over to france stood in a reviewing stand while cortelyou school filed by on parade each class handing in a check for its quota of the great fund one of the most impressive moments of his life dr fiske called it it was so impressive that the school’s physi cal director caught the contagion for france on the woman citizen that very day and the school nurse up and vol unteered likewise as a red cross nurse this is what those earnest children did sent an ambulance and two people to the front and that ambulance was not bought in any casual or injudicious manner believe cortel you dr fiske sent finer and finer types to p s 139 for inspection until finally he found the latest most'up to date type and it was chosen it stood in the playground in all its efiicient grayness while the children were marched out all the way from first grade up to the eighth to look it over and it was solemnly approved and bought in july 1917 and expected to go to france at once but this wasn't the end of the story of cortelyou school ambulance he king’s county unit was delayed dr fiske was delayed the physical director and the red cross nurse were delayed while the ambulance created out of love and service and cakes and junk and grass cutting did odd jobs for the king’s county hospital in times of emergency with a plate on its side explaining it as the gift of cortelyou school and then on february lst 1918 notice came from washington to the much tried little work ers of brooklyn that requirements for ambu lances were all changed and the government could not use this ambulance which was re turned forthwith to the donors now an ambulance is of about as much use to a city public school as a street sprinkling cart would be in venice here was a perfectly typical white elephant on the staff of the women's oversea hospi tals u s a are several brooklyn women therefore miss langthorn assistant principal of cortelyou school bethought herself of offer ing the ambulance to the women's hospitals for service in france through mrs george not man of the brooklyn suffrage party who ac cepted it with heartfelt thanks continued on page 198 august 3 1918 industrial women’s new milestone he long up ward climb of the industrial woman has reached a vantage point within the last few weeks early in july just between the fourth of july and bastile day to make it more emphatic secretary of labor wilson announced the establishment of a w'oman’s bureau in the united states department of labor this is considered by the national women’s trade union league to be one of the most significant acts of the present administration it is the first time they say that the govern ment has given full recognition to the woman's point of view in the councils of labor it is also the first time that a trade union woman has been given an appointment to an adminis trative office in a national executive depart ment there is no woman on the national war labor board there is no woman on the executive council of the american federation of labor at the head of the new bureau will be miss mary van kleeck chief of the woman’s branch of the ordnance bureau in the war depart ment formerly with the russell sage foun dation in new york her assistant will be miss mary anderson a member of the execu tive board of the boot and shoe workers union and for seven years organizer of the national women’s trade union league and the present vice chairman of the washington committee of the league 153 anderson who is of swedish birth knows the labor story for she has lived it as a stitcher in the chicago shoe fac tories for eighteen years during much of that time she was president of the chicago boot and shoe workers local and for a year when she was working in a factory at lynn mass she was president of the women’s local there miss anderson enters her new position from the ordnance bureau of the war department where she has been supervisor in the woman's branch of the industrial service section in this capacity her work consisted chiefly of con ferences with workers and employers in con nection with the enforcement of the govern ment’s labor policy in munition factories the need for the woman’s bureau and our great hopes as to what it will do says miss anderson grow out of the fact that the pe culiar problems surrounding women in industry have never received enough attention the reason they have not is i think that the wom an’s point of view has never been represented in policy making boards until traditions are broken and men ac quire the habit of putting women in adminis trative and consultative positions as readily and as frequently as they put men in such places the woman's bureau has a big work cut out for it the greatest thing in the future of the woman’s bureau will be the fact that its chief a woman will be a member of the war labor policies board this means that she will have equal authority with any man on the board not only with regard to women but with re gard to men also bringing to bear in the gov emment for the first time in the history of this women in industry service country the woman’s view on labor questions miss anderson expresses herself strongly in favor of writing the government’s labor stand ards into all government contracts the great est problem of all the new bureau will have to deal with she says is the problem of securing equal pay for equal work by women and men in scores of factories according to her obser vations women are now doing men’s work for less than men are paid 6 we must focus attention on such things as this and on the ten hour shift that prevails for women in some factories both day and night women know what such conditions mean to women the mothers of the race on these and all other labor questions we hope to make the woman’s bureau the expression of the labor woman’s point of view in the govern ment's labor administration the oilicial title of the new bureau is the woman in industry service women lead ers in the labor movement for at least nine years have seen the necessity for such a bureau it was at the request of the national women’s trade union league that the jones casey bill was introduced in congress in 1916 it was computed that with women constituting 20 per cent of the wage earners of the country and the number constantly grow ing only 4 per cent of the funds appropriated for industrial investigation were devoted to the study of the special problems of women in in dustry vital facts concerning the conditions of women’s work were not available the jones casey bill never reached a vote in congress but the war itself did for women in this instance what‘it has done for women in other forms of liberation from old and binding traditionalism men used to say glibly that they represented women but now they can say this no more and they themselves know it this is a part of what the secretary of labor has to say about the establishment of this far sighted program for the working woman the women’s division has been established in response to needs widely felt by all men aswell as women who are conscious of the increasing share women must have in the in dustrial activities of the war the women’s division will concern itself primarily with war conditions but will be mind ful of the need for observing and interpreting the tendencies in women’s employment which are likely to have permanent social effects an instance of the imperative need of such a bureau is the first task undertaken by this women’s division to investigate and re commend as to whether the government shall sanction the employment of women in hazard ous chemical industries where only men have hitherto been employed the question has been put into the hands of a committe of ex perts by miss mary van kleeck chief of the bureau and the commmittee assembled in washington last saturday to begin its work miss anderson assistant chief was sent to niagara falls n y to visit the industries in digitized by 195 a clearing house of thought and leadership l have urged and congress has now granted the necessary authority to estab lish a woman’s division in the depart ment of labor its immediate task will be to develop in the industries of the country policies and methods which will result in the most efective use of women’s services in production for the war while at the same time preventing their em ployment under injurious conditions its large and very necessary aim will be to focus attention on the national importance of the conditions of women’s work as influencing national standards and as af fecting the welfare of the entire nation the problems of women in industry are so manifold and complex that a clear ing house of thought and leadership is needed by the national government the women’s division has been established to give leadership to make this leadership efcctive however i confidently appeal to all for co operation with miss van klee e and miss anderson to women individ ually and through their organisations to national and state administrations and to industry generally william bauchop wilson secretary of labor question and make a preliminary report on the situation in time for the committee’s meeting the committee consisted of experts in in dustrial hygiene and sanitation most of them representing departments of the government handling contracts with the industries in ques tion the list of those invited by miss van kleeck included lieut col harry e mock surgeon general’s thce chairman captain austin d reilley ordnance department sec retary dr alice hamilton of the bureau of labor statistics expert in industrial poisons miss mary anderson commander riley of the navy department john vogt of the new york state department of labor dr richard m pearce of the national research council captain bradley of the gas defense service miss nelle swartz chief of the new woman’s bureau of the new york state department of labor dr a j scherewsky of the public health service this investigation is undertaken as the result of a request from the employers association of niagara falls at which point are centered 21 industries producing chlorine caustic soda electrodes formaldehyde poison gas and other basic war materials the employers asso ciation states that polish women here are anxious to go on shift work of 8 hours pro vided such permission could be obtained from the department subject of course to super vision and suspension by the president our first consideration in this matter says miss van kleeck will be to assure ourselves just what the hazards are and whether they are of a kind to which women are more susceptible than men if the conditions are found to be such as not to warrant the government’s sanc tion for the employment of women our experts hope to be able in any case to minimize the hazards an improve th conditions for men 008 c 196 the woman citizen journal of a y worker under fire he work gets more interesting every day t yesterday we ordered our uniforms they are of gray whipcord with f rench blue collars ties scarfs and hats and are fairly good looking and very comfortable we are wearing them as nonchalantly as possible and trying to look as though we had worn them all our lives with only occasional lapses into civil ian’s clothing we wear white shirts in paris and blue in the field our pinafores are of blue chambray and our dress up ones of a jolly chintz our insignia all have the red triangle the hut pinafores have little white collars and caps we also have bright cretonne aprons for dress occasions all the aprons are made by mrs conkling’s french women about whom i will tell you later and we are trying to get the shirtwaist order for her too the capes are of dark green cloth with the blue collars i don’t think it has missed raining a single day since i have been here and the mud has somewhat the color and consistency of soft fudge i wear my big shoes all the time and my raincape much of the time and even an umbrella part of the time which i consider a great concession to the weather but when one has only one uniform and hat to last nine months and has to go to bed while they are cleaned and pressed one has a care did i tell you that we didn’t have to pay for our uni forms the y m c a now furnishes one uniform with two skirts one hat four shirt waists aprons and a cape so that much money is saved for something else we wear our uniforms always even if we are invited to the general’s for dinner which we aren’t we wear them we have struck on the high collars though and wear them turned down in a little v shape they are so much more be coming that way we are told they are very smart looking and they certainly save a lot of trouble our spare time is becoming a joke we haven't any l 9 f i had worried before about the future pop i ulation of france i have ceased to since i have lived on this street i have never seen so many children before in my life they all wear little pinafores and have bright red cheeks and look just like poulbot’s sketches and they all say good night quite indiscrimi nately at any time of day it’s funny to hear them use the english they have picked up tonight i saw a whole row of little girls lined up to salute some otiicers we’ve been having lots of fun with our pe culiar french one day this week we went shopping for rubber gloves in our very best french as we thought everywhere we asked they merely threw up their hands or looked vague but polite as the french always do finally we found some on a counter and triumphantly purchased them we found out that the reason we had gotten no results before was that we had been asking for dents de caoutchouc instead of gants meaning rub ber teeth instead of rubber gloves started to tell about mrs conkling’s work this morning she took us through her ouvroir and i had tea with her yesterday she has a beautiful home an apartment up near the bois we went first of all to the little house where the french women were sewing it is really a community house where anyone in a lihl v what they are wearing in france by helen perry in paris you see only uniforms and mourning all the red cross workers canteen workers telephone girls etc are in uniform as are the french women serving as conductors cab drivers etc our uniform is recognized every where we go is usually saluted by oficers and is a great protection from annoyance in a french town like this mldeub w 7 r t h styles for canteeners that quarter of paris who is needy may find work these women each do the thing they can do best embroidery tine sewing fitting laundering dressmaking etc they are mak ing the aprons for the y m c a and we hope to get them the waist orders too they are making and dressing quaint dolls in an other building near by they give out coarse sewing and knitting to the women who can only work at home they are paid very small sums for these for instance twenty live cents for a pair of stockings but it keeps them from star vation at least and gives them a steady em ployment in still another building they give out garments to the refugees a big box just came as we were there mrs conkling says that the shoes especially are a god send as their price in paris is prohibitive nothing worn is too poor to send old dresses old underclothes hats coats shoes anything if you have any thing at all send it it all helps such a lot over here mrs conkling is doing this work in connection with the sisters who have always worked in that quarter of paris and know who are worthy and who are not e petit ouvroir du gros caillou was com menced in august 1914 as soon as the war broke out by mrs henry conkling the wife of an american physician living in paris know ing the conditions of the working people of the city mrs conkling with the help of a french lady mademoiselle guilhou set up a little work shop to give sewing to mothers of families whose means of subsistence had been suddenly swept away from that time to this large num bers of destitute parisians have been kept from utter misery by means of the modest ouvroir money raised largely in the united states is dispensed as small daily wages for sewing to grandmothers mothers and young girls many of whom are refugees in addition boxes upon boxes of partially worn garments above all shoes have been packed in the united states and distributed among the little workers of the quartier gros caillou in normal times it is hoped by the promoters that this little work shop will become self supporting but that can not happen until after the war ends editor’s note a

host of the best men and women in the country were her co workers in the ameri can association the compilers of the his tory of woman suffrage were warm par tisans of the national wing of the move ment and they have naturally laid most stress upon its activities but the work of the ameri can was extensive earnest influential and wise ucy stone was one of the most modest and self effacing of women she had no thirst for fame she kept no record of her work did not save her press clippings and when importuned to furnish particulars of her life for books of famous women refused almost with horror her zeal for woman suf frage was apostolic it was like a fire in the bones there was something about her peculiarly sweet and winning almost angelic that took people captive obstinate opponents were sometimes converted merely by the sight of her face all the purely womanly instincts were strong in her to the last she loved a love story she had infinite motherliness her face always beamed at the sight of a baby and all children were drawn to her like bees to a flower on countless occasions during her lecture trips on boat or train she helped worried and anxious young mothers to soothe a crying child she was an excellent cook and housekeeper of the old new england type she made her own yeast her own dried beef even her own soap lthough so quiet and gentle she hardly knew what fear was she told us that in all the mobs and tumults of the early days she was never conscious of a quickened heart beat her husband called her the gentlest and most heroic of women she showed the same courage when she learned that she was to die i know the eternal order and i believe in it she said i have not a fear nor a dread nor a doubt to a friend who expressed the wish that she might have lived to see suffrage granted she answered oh i shall know it i think i shall know it on the other side when a letter from the women's press asso ciation was read to her speaking warmly of her work she said slowly i think i have done what i could i certainly have tried with one hand i made my family comfortable with the other there her voice failed through weakness she meant that with the other she had tried to help the world her last words to her daughter were make the world better she passed away on october 18 1893 she had advised her family not to have a public funeral she thought there wo uld not be many who would care to come but the people be gan to gather hours beforehand when the doors were opened hundreds were standing silently in the street the great church was crowded dr charles g ames said afterwards that it was less like a funeral than a coronation from sea to sea the newspapers even those most op posed to equal rights bore testimony to her worth a life long enemy declared that up to that time the death of no woman in america had called forth so wide an expression of public affection and esteem he protest published by lucy stone and henry b blackwell at the time of their wedding was as follows while acknowledging our mutual affection by publicly assuming the relationship of bus band and wife yet in justice to ourselves and a great principle we deem it our duty to de clare that this act on our part implies no sanc tion of nor promise of voluntary obedience to such of the present laws of marriage as refuse to recognize the wife as an independent rational being while they confer upon the husband an injurious and unnatural superiority investing him with legal powers which no honorable man would exercise and which no man should possess we protest especially against the laws which give the husband 1 the custody of the wife’s person 2 the exclusive control and guardianship of their children 3 the sole ownership of her personal and use of her real estate unless previously settled upon her or placed in the hands of trustees as in the case of minors idiots and lunatics 4 the absolute right to the product of her industry 5 also against laws which give to the widower so much larger and more permanent an interest in the property of his deceased wife than they give to the widow in that of her de ceased husband 6 finally against the whole system by which the legal existence of the wife is suspended during marriage so that in most states she neither has a legal part in the choice of her residence nor can she make a will nor sue or be sued in her own name nor inherit property we believe that personal independence and equal human rights can never be forfeited except for crime that marriage should be an equal and permanent partnership and so rec ognized by law that until it is so recognized married partners should provide against the radical injustice of present laws by every means in their power we believe that where domestic dii‘n'culties arise no appeal should be made to legal tri bunals under existing laws but that all dith culties should be submitted to the equitable adjustment of arbitrators mutually chosen thus reverencing law we enter our protest against rules and customs which are unworthy of the name since they violate justice the es sence of law henry b bucxwm lucy stone west brookiield mass may 1

both sides of the chamber it had strong backing from democrats and re publicans and strong opposition also the same is true in the case of the suiirage amendment which is still pending at the time this is written while the income tax amendment and that for the popular election of senators were submitted by a non partisan vote as any constitutional amendment must be they had been planks in the democratic platform and for that reason deserve to be classed among the achievements of the democratic party we are told that the women of the west voted for wilson because he kept us out of war granted they did not vote for him be cause of what he promised to do in the future but because of what he had done it is a note worthy fact that when war was declared all those far western states with one exception filled their quota before the draft went into effect the western woman is no flaccid shrinking advocate of peace at any price the women of america want this war waged to a conclusive peace failure is impossible but if we win and go our victorious way to build greater navies more deadly weapons with which to keep the world an armed camp piling the taxes ever higher against that future day when we shall again go forth to slay and be slain then we shall have lost all democracy stands for and all for which humanity and civilization are struggling today the immediate object of this war is to do away forever with the power of one man to bring about such woe and misery but the ultimate aim for which we fight is the abolition of war and that the world shall be safe for the peoples who live upon it and have made it their own unless democracy means that we shall spend our millions for those things which are perma nent for life more abundant for freedom of body and soul

stopping the practice boston mass charles a morss chairman executive committee liberty loan committee of new england what the grange says to the editor of the woman citizen ur position regarding woman suffrage is so well stated in the master’s address given at state grange that i enclose it herewith the grange has always prided itself and justly that it was the original woman suffrage organization of the land we approached this subject from a different angle from most re formers while many sought to enfranchise women because it would further temperance reform the grange took a higher stand we said women have the inherent right to vote as citizens regardless of how they would vote on any measure and time proved us to be right this question is settled in our state but let us not abate our efforts until it is settled in our whole nation a simple inexpensive but most effective and practical plan of making the farmers in fluence of the nation most effective in securing action on the federal suffrage amendment both in the united states senate and in the legislatures of the several states would be the organization of a farmers national committee on woman suffrage to direct the farmers end of the necessary supporting campaign i believe suitable action at the session suggesting the desirability of this to the governing board of the farmers national headquarters and to the woman’s suffrage associations might result in action that would insure speedy vic tory for national woman suffrage we would suggest only one change in this report and that is that the committee referred to be a committee of farm women with head quarters with the other farm organizations we believe in view of the service rendered by the women all over the world during the war that this should be a campaign now not only for national but for world wide woman suffrage we women of washington are proud of our freedom and want to do all we can to help the women of other states and other

what cortelyou ambulance did it cantered off all by itself and refused to go in the red cross parade just got its back up over being rejected for the army no doubt all the little cortelyou uns were asked very politely to march in the red cross parade with their very own ambulance at the head of all the elemen tary schools in the city and they all accepted and dressed themselves up with a fine silk ban ner made on purpose to tell about their ambu lance fathers and mothers lined the curbs just the way fathers and mothers do when their big sons go out in khaki in order to see the children’s ambulance go by everyone was quite without any anxiety that a huge gray motor vehicle could get itself misc laid like a laundry bill or a fountain pen but that is what this ill starred ambulance did

new y rk the woman citizen the woman’s journal a journal of democracy august 31 1918 we shall jight for things which we have always carried nearest our hearts for democracy for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government vote it in ast saturday at a caucus of republican senators a resolu l tion was passed which urged that the consideration of the federal suffrage amendment be proceeded with immediately after disposition of the pending unfinished business and set forth the intention of the republicans to insist upon a final vote on the resolution at the earliest possible mouent which sounds good and would be good if the resolution did not carry this rider provided that this resolution shall not be construed as in any way binding the action or vote of any member of the senate upon the merits of the said woman sufrage amendment in this day and generation for a party caucus to urge a vote on the amendment without endorsing the amendment itself is to stage hamlet without the dane in failing to endorse ithe repub lican party whips lost a great opportunity to score a definite party advantage it is true that the republicans can deliver to the support of the amendment a two thirds majority of their voting strength in the senate as the poll now stands put it is equally true that the democrats can at any moment walk away with the honors of the situation by breaking their own deadlock on it the day has gone by for mere defensive action mere jug gling with time and party advantage on the part of republicans as of democrats the day has come instead for a vigorous offen sive that shall win to the one party or the other the full credit for making america a democracy for all american people instead of for half of them women have come a long way in political education since 1916 they have come a long way in democratic idealism meantime they have been so often called on to defend the federal suffrage amendment from party politics at washington that they have no difficulty in discriminating between propositions that are made for party advantage at the expense of the amendment and proposi tions that are made for the advantage of the amendment it will be distinctly disastrous to the democrats to defeat the amendment by failing to supply their two thirds majority it will be equally disastrous for any republicans to urge the vote for it is by no means enough in women’s eyes to have the amendment voted on it must be voted in the purpose of insuring the defeat of the amendment helping win the war t is sometimes asked will equal suffrage help to win the war we believe that it will and there can be no ques tion that the success of the equal rights movement so far as it has already gone is helping to win the war when that movement began it was thought improper for women to organize in susan b anthony’s youth it was looked upon as unwomanly even to join a temperance association when lucy stone was a girl the antislavery society was split in twain because a woman had been appointed on a committee if those oldirestrictions had been kept up where would be the possibility of all the manifold war work that women are doing now to save the world from german tyranny yet to overthrow those anti quated ideas cost years of hard labor under persecution and obloquy every path which now lies wide open before women has been worn smooth by the bleeding feet of those who broke the road if elizabeth blackwell had not pioneered the way for women into the medical profession in the face of countless difficulties where would be the beautiful work of the women’s overseas hospitals in france american women physicians now caring for thousands of wounded soldiers and of suffering civilians when there are not nearly enough men doctors to look after them it is a special satisfaction to suffragists that those hos pital units were organized by the women connected with the new york infirmary for women and children founded in 1857 by the doctors elizabeth and emily blackwell and dr marie zakrzewska and that they are financed by the national ameri can woman suffrage association obviously women can do a great deal more and better war work than they could if their hands were still tied by the old tra ditional restrictions which left them uneducated forbade them to organize or to speak in public debarred them if married from the control of their own property and earnings and frowned upon every sort of public activity on their part they can do more and better service not only for the foreign war but in all the good fights at home against tuberculosis liquor child labor and the whole black brood of domestic enemies when the last fetter is taken off they will be able to give better a s b digitized by 600816 service still 266 he men of america need equal suffrage for women immediately because of four facts one of which has reference only to american conditions the other three are universal first the men of this nation must grant equal suffrage to women fully freely and cheerfully at once in order to square their nation’s acts with its declarations we male citizens of the united states after three years of debate and deliberation solemnly and practically unanimously declared that a government without the consent of the governed was unjust and that the existence of such a government was a menace to all free govern ments we both publicly pledged our nation to the principle of self government and voted to consecrate every dollar of our wealth and every drop of our blood to the cause of human free dom and human justice to the end that this world might be made safe for democracy england france and russia ac cepted our principle and our leadership in good faith russia has freed even her illiterate peasants england has offered self government to the irish and russia france england and canada have all either already granted equal suffrage to their women or have pledged to do so promptly we alone lag behind the united states cannot lead in a war for democracy and be the last great nation to establish democracy to pledge ourselves to democracy and then refuse to grant representation in our govern ment to half of our adult educated population is to give support to the kaiser’s contention that our democratic pretensions are pure hypocrisy the minute that this nation officially declared war upon autocratic germany for the cause of democracy the enfranchisement of our entire intelligent adult population in cluding the women ceased to be a matter of personal judgment or state privilege and became a sacred national pledge which congress is in honor bound to redeem at once or brand us as a nation of knaves or fools before the bar of intelligent public opinion of the world in short we must grant women equal suf frage by federal amendment at once to demonstrate the sincerity of our nation’s pretensions second we need woman’s suffrage to protect us and our gov ernment from our own one sided masculine view of life this is not to say that our man’s views are wrong or that the women’s views are right we mean only that each view is partial and inadequate and needs the other to balance and complete it with few exceptions men are more interested in problems of produc tion distribution and sale in questions relating to economics and property interests or in abstract speculation women are usually more concerned with problems of conservation of personal rela tions of human happiness and human welfare the future wel fare of men as well as of women is dependent upon proper gov ernmental attention to questions of health and hygiene of food and housing of human protection in industry of child welfare in short of municipal state and national housekeeping women are by nature more concerned than men with these vital questions of personal relation and human welfare and when women have adequate voice in our government we can hope for wiser and more speedy solution of these grave problems third men need to grant to women the privileges and duties of citizenship in order to strengthen the weakening family bond and enrich and elevate the home life for themselves and their children it is obvious that the great problems of municipal state and national government offer one a broader mental horizon than by a caswell ellis professor of philosophy of education in the university of texas the woman citizen why men need suffrage for women do those of a single family the daily work of the mother while demanding the highest intelli gence can very easily drop into a ceaseless round of petty routine it is not always true that the family conversation becomes a mere recounting of commonplace details about foods and servants clothing and neighborhood gos sip but this alas is the usual result it is contrary to human nature that women who are not allowed to participate in public life should take enough interest in public welfare or governmental problems to inform themselves upon them or to enjoy discussing them in the home if the husband is to find expression for his interests in the broader problems of life he must leave the home and go to his club the street or the hotel lobby the addition of women to the electorate would give a wholesome corrective for the narrowing effect of routine home duties of women and by furnishing broad matters of common interest for father mother and children would elevate and strengthen home life and con tribute largely toward bringing up the next generation with higher and better ideals of citizenship and of home fourth and most far reaching of all man must grant equal suffrage to woman in order to refine his own sense of justice which is inevitably dulled by the continued toleration of any act of injustice every one knows that his ideas infiuence and modify his acts but few recognize how much their ideas are colored and modified by their habits of acting if we live under a social or civic system that leads us to act in a certain way we soon begin to justify that act if we habitually act toward any class of people as if they were of a certain character we soon find our selves either consciously or unconsciously accepting a view that is in accord with our conduct this fact was deeply impressed upon me one day in berlin the social democrats were demanding equal suffrage for the men in prussia with such vigor that the kaiser brought about forty thousand troops into the city and filled the open square with machine guns in order to awe the population at that time an honest intel ligent carpenter or stonemason had about one two hundred and fiftieth of a vote in i prussia i remarked l to the wife of a dis i tinguished g e r m a n i _i wk 3‘73 1'3 professor at whose home i was staying at the time vhy not let these honest intel ligent men have a vote she threw up her hands in genuine horror at the idea and exclaimed mer ciful heavens let that herd vote why they would steal everything we have h away from us and rinse cont d 0 p090 2 8 dead against the wind digitized by 600816 august 31 1918 267 easier to amend one than f orty eight n august 8th the senate floor was the scene of a suffrage debate when senator james reed from missouri proved that he had given no very serious thought to the difhculties of amending the state constitutions one by one so as to admit women to the electorate at that time senator reed pushed aside as of no importance the obstacles in the way of amending the consti tutions of certain states when senator jones of new mexico assured him that his own state’s constitution was practically un amendable mr reed acknowledged that there might be difficul ties in the way of amending the benighted constitution of senator jones’s state but there were only one or two out of 48 states which presented such problems on august 12th senator shafroth of colorado staunch friend of woman suffrage took occasion to explain upon the senate floor the insurmountable ditiiculties well known to suffragists and to students of state constitutions in senator shafroth’s explanation given in the pages of the congressional record of august 12 he said in part mr shafroth mr president in a colloquy which occurred between the senator from missouri mr reed and myself at the last session of the senate a question was raised as to why the women were asking to put through an amendment to the f ed eral constitution granting woman suffrage instead of attempting to amend the constitutions of the states i referred to the fact that there were several states that had obstructions to the adop tion of amendments of their constitutions which made it very burdensome and almost impossible to accomplish that end the senator referred to the fact that i had mentioned obstructions in two or three states only and therefore it was not difficult i stated at the time that i thought there were some 12 or 15 states with such obstructive provisions i have now a compilation of the matter from the national woman suerage association and i desire to call attention to what these difficulties are in the passage of a joint resolution for the adoption by con gress of a constitutional amendment it is necessary that there should be a concurrence upon the part of the senate and the house by a two thirds vote in each body but when such federal amendment is referred to the legislatures of the states all that is necessary there is that a majority vote of the house and the senate of such state should concur in the adoption of the amend ment how different it is when a state constitution is to be adopted amendment states from which senator shafroth quoted almost impossible states in new mexico during the first 25 years of statehood the adoption of a state constitutional amendment for woman suffrage requires a majority of three fourths of all who vote on any ques tion or candidate at the election when it is submitted and there must be two thirds of these in each county a provision which is absolutely prohibitive the constitution of indiana says if a majority of the electors of the state shall vote to ratify an amendment it shall become a part of the constitution al though it would require a census of male citizens to determine the number of electors the constitution made in 1851 has never been thus amended only one amendment at a time can be sub mitted in illinois and to be adopted must receive a majority of the highest number of votes cast at the election this oiiers small chance for woman suffrage in south carolina senator shafroth explains a very serious obstacle after an amendment has been submitted by a two thirds vote of two legislatures and has received a majority of as many votes as were cast for representatives in the legislature this body at its next session may nullify the election this is the case in m18 sissippi after an amendment has received a majority of the highest number of votes cast at the election woman suffrage by state action in south carolina and mississippi is practically impossible by constitutional amendment in new hampshire the legislature cannot submit an amend ment to the lvoters but this can be done only by a constitutional convention which meets once in seven years in vermont there can be a constitutional convention but once in ten years in many states the calling of such a convention is very difficult and com plete woman suffrage never has been granted anywhere through the submission of an amendment by a constitutional convention large legislative majority required in many states a two thirds or three fifths majority of the legislature is necessary to submit an amendment to the voters these are alabama connecticut florida georgia illinois ken tucky louisiana maine maryland massachusetts michigan mississippi nebraska north carolina ohio south carolina tennessee texas vermont and west virginia 20 in a num ber of the states two successive legislatures must vote to submit an amendment these are connecticut indiana iowa maine mas sachusetts new jersey north dakota tennessee vermont vir ginia and wisconsin 11 in all of these states except massa chusetts and new jersey the legislature meets biennially thus requiring at least three years to have an amendment sent to the voters the alabama legislature meets only once in four years an amendment cannot be re submitted in illinois for four years in pennsylvania new.jersey and kentucky for five years in tennessee for six years large majority of popular vote necessary rhode island requires a t‘hree fi fths majority and new hamp shire a two thirds majority of the votes cast on an amendment for its adoption the following states require a majority of the largest number of votes cast at the election not simply on the amendment arkansas illinois minnesota mississippi nebraska oklahoma south carolina and tennessee require a majority of the highest number of votes cast for representatives in the legislature thus in all of these statesthe ballots not marked for or against an amendment are counted as opposed the requirements in indiana and new mexico are cited above in these twelve states it is almost impossible to amend the con stitution a study of the above facts should convince all fair minded per sons of the great difficulty and long delay of obtaining woman suffrage by individual action of the states when added to these are the vast expense and the time and work required from thou sands of women the advantage of a federal amendment with the comparatively easy and speedy process of gaining it by con sent of three fourths of the state legislatures should need no argument in its favor it seems to me continued the senator from colorado under those circumstances the obstructions are insurmountable continued on page 278 digitized by goosic 268 the woman citizen in all candor gentlemen what the tennessee 6 he tennessee bar asso ciation goes on record as endorsing woman suffrage by federal amendment so reads the resolution adopted at their annual convention we had a great and wonderful fight to put the resolution through especially with by federal amendment attached to it there were present only a few women suffragists to assist as the heat was unearthly and the hall where the convention was in progress was almost too hot to endure without fainting there were present mesdames ed watkins j l meek samuel b smith t c ervin all of chattanooga david b puryear of memphis miss sarah ruth frazier of chattanooga and at torneys elizabeth lea miller of bolivar and myself now of nashville the last two named are voting members of the tennessee bar association our men suffragists were splendid in their assistance especially the following col ed watkins of chattanooga president of the association a copy of whose eloquent plea i enclose judge david b puryear of memphis who introduced the resolution hon foster v brown of chattanooga who used great tact at torneys j j lynch samuel bosworth smith w g m thomas j g cantrell w b swaney all of chattanooga attorney j h spraken of jackson judges malone and r m barton attorneys w n briggs lee winchester and elias gates all of memphis and attorney p d maddin and judge j w judd of nashville we had our plans made to bring this question up on the last day of the convention but since announcement was made that our main speaker senator john sharp williams of mississippi was unable to attend and as the long hot and arduous day was drawing to a close the convention voted to hold no session the next day per the program but to adjourn at once in looking over the crowd who were able to stand the heat and had remained i saw that our friends were in the majority and though judge puryear was without hope i insisted upon the vote he therefore introduced the resolution president watkins handled the situation admirably and hon foster v brown made a few telling remarks the vote was called for and the resolu tion passed unanimously nashville is the only part of our state where anti suffrage has ever been able to gain a foothold which is i think due to the in fluence of an anti col vertrees a prominent lawyer there you can understand the great importance of this victory when you recall that only two years ago the suffragists of memphis made a strong fight to pass a resolution in the tennessee bar association in convention assembled there endorsing merely the principle of woman suffrage which failed by a large majority we sent a telegram to senator shields telling him the glad news since he has made the claim that the majority of his con stituency does not want woman suffrage we feel the passage of this resolution for suffrage by federal amendment by the lawyers from all over our state for lawyers are supposed to represent the highest thought and the most intelligent ideas of their communities and in fact to influence and crystallize public sentiment will assist himin making his decision and insure his voting aye upon the amendment bill in september we have called a suffrage meeting for this week and will pass a resolution thanking the bar and president watkins by a woman member margaret h ervin ford bar association did i am glad that i was privileged to return to my state in time to assist with this work at the present time which it seems to me is the most crucial in our long suffrage fight i feel sure senator shields will vote for our amendment and i feel certain we’ll win here is an extract from the speech of col ed watkins presi dent of the bar association 661 t was universal suffrage to which i referred when i stated that later on i would discuss one other subject which de mands according to my humble views prompt generous and effective legislation i ask in all candor gentlemen upon what just ground is there an embargo placed upon the rights of woman denying her the privileges of freedom and liberty which are accorded to man our speakers from every platform in this glorious republic regale the people with the cry that we are in this world wide war not alone in the defense of the people of the united states but in the universal defense of all the people of the world who are denied their rights their privileges and their liberties under the law and especially those whose liberties have been trampled under foot so as to deny them equal privileges and rights with all other peeple we pause but for a moment to take a view of the picture which confronts us we see this glorious republic for which we freely offer our lives as a sacrifice upon its altar with one stroke of the pen enfranchise and extend privi leges to 4,000,000 ignorant inhabitants which franchise and which privileges they have to this day and still we deny these same rights and franchise to the educated and refined daughters of this beloved america of ours they own in their own right 39 per cent of the property per sonal and real in this state and pay their part of the taxes neces sary to bear the burdens of the government and yet we deny them the right to in any way express their views as to who should manage this trust fund to which they so liberally contribute it is but recently that a married woman could sell and convey her property without the consent and signature of her husband and even now her personal property when reduced to the possession of her husband becomes his without her consent or volition and frequently over her strenuous objections if she happened to have a bad husband she has not left to her even a chinaman’s chance w hen we became engaged in this the greatest war ever known it was difficult to arouse the patriotism of the men to the standard of necessary efficiency appeals were made to the women and with wings of angels they flew to the colors and their actions so electrified our people that the sentiment of unalloyed patriotism swept the country and today through this influence we are marshaling an army of stalwart americans superior to any the world has ever seen i our women have not the physical strength to fight our battles but they instill courage into the wavering men and drive the weak ening soldiers on to victory by their christian devotion and their deep earnestness of sentiment and purpose it was a country girl full of faith and honesty of purpose and with a supreme devotion to the cause of liberty that saved orleans for the french digitized by 600816 august 31 1918 it will be pure and good women of this country by their cour age and christian virtues that will save to us our beautiful land and will we longer deny them the rights and privileges which we enjoy if we are an important factor in this great common wealth then let our motto be that justice i to others show that justice show to me liberty loan in the third liberty loan drive which we had on our streets there was the largest procession ever witnessed in chattanooga and the most impressive scene was the mothers of children five six and seven years of age leading the little fellows by their hands in this great parade to impress them in the early dawn of life with the true sentiments of patriotism that they might become loyal citizens when grown to man hood i have seen those lovely women of our city in broiling sunlight lead the selectrnen to the railroad station for enter tainment while our men stood idly along the sidewalks shaded by comfortable um brellas i have seen our most ntewl‘ed w men 3 congress women of england have saved the allied cause lloyd george tells women’s congress in paris paris august 21 premier lloyd george sent this letter to the i am anxious to bear testimony to the tremendous part played by the 269 of ammunition at the somme had it not been for the work of women are you going to fling them out without a voice in de termining the new conditions it would be an outrage that is why the woman question has become very largely a war question ex premier asquith march 28 1917 the house will not be unprepared to hear that i myself and i believe many others no longer regard this question of woman suffrage from the standpoint which we occupied before the war how could we have carried on the war without them what moves me still more is the problem of reconstruction after the war questions which will necessarily arise in regard to women’s labor and women’s functions are questions in regard to which i for my part feel it impossible consistently with either justice or expediency to withhold from women the power and the right of making their voices distinctly heard sir wilfrid laurier ex premier of canada february 1917 today my own belief is that there is no reason why she should be denied the right of the ballot premier hearst of on tario canada february 1917 having taken our accomplished society ladies lead this march in the sun shine and in the rain bearing immense flags of our country when they knew not a single man in the column except that all were loyal american citizens offering their lives upon the altar of their coun try as a sacrifice to the great cause in which we are at present engaged these scenes became so impressive to the men that they also began to form an honor escort for these boys who were going to fight for us and like the in fiuences of the country girl who saved orleans it aroused all to the highest pitch of patriotism protection of woman’s rights advancing no personal interest or claims but stand ing for universal suffrage women of england in this vital epoch of human history they have not only borne their burden of sorrow and separation with unflinching fortitude and patience but they have assumed an enormous share of the burdens necessary to the practical conduct of the war if it had not been for the splendid manner in which the women came forward to work in the hospitals and munition factories in administrative omces of all kinds and in war work behind the lines often in daily danger of their lives great britain and i believe all the allies would have been unable to withstand the enemy attacks of the last few months for this service to our common cause humanity owes them unbounded gratitude in the past i have heard it said that women were unlit to vote because they would be weak when it came to understanding the issues and bearing the strains of a great war my experience in south wales last week is what has connrmed me in the belief that the women there understand perfectly what is at stake in this war i believe they recognize as clearly as any that there can be no peace progress or happiness in the world so long as the monster of militarism is able to stalk unbridled and unashamed among the weaker peoples to them this war is a crusade of righteousness and gentleness and they do not mean to make peace until the allies have made it impossible for another carnival of violence to befall mankind i am certain that this resolution of the women of south wales is but typical of the spirit of the women of the rest of great britain this war began in order that force and brutality might crush out freedom among men its authors cannot have foreseen that one of its main effects would be to give women a commanding position and influence in the public affairs of the world to their ennobling influence we look not only for strength to win the war but for inspiration during the great work of reconstruction we will have to undertake after victory is won the women who have been flocking to france to work for the allies are among the foremost leaders in this great movement of regeneration my message to their representatives gathered in paris is this well done carry on you are helping to create a new earth for yourselves and your children women into partnership with us in our tremendous under taking i ask can we justly deny them a share in the gov ernment of the country the right to have a say about the making of the laws they have been so heroically trying to defend my answer is i think not premier bosselli of italy may 15 1917 as far as the woman vote for municipal elections is concerned i do not think there can be either doubt or delay in giving it on the same conditions as it is given to men in february 1917 signor sacchi italian minister of justice presenting to the ital ian chamber a bill for the abrogation of every law by which in the field of civil and commercial rights the capaci ties of women are at present curtailed called it an act of which guarantees to women the right to participate in the selec tion of their own representatives who fix the burdens upon and proxlide the protection for her property her liberty and her rights i ask will you deny her request will you rend the strongest and brightest link in the golden chain of a perpetual union will you longer deny the ladies of this state at least privileges equal to those which you claim and enjoy expressions of great men i read you some expressions from famous men premier lloyd george of great britain march 29 1917 women’s work in the war has been vital to our success it would have been impossible to produce that overwhelming mass justice of reparation almost to which women have now more right than ever said m pierre etienne flandin deputy of the yonne the reporter to the chamber of deputies of the municipal suffrage bill for french women what french women have done to keep up the courage of the nation during the dark days cannot be measured in words they have been the backbone of the national defense they should have the right to vote first of all as an act of justice and secondly as a move dictated by public interest president woodrow wilson january 9 1918 a delegation of leading democrats who had waited on the president issued the following statement when we sought the advice he very continued on page 278 digitized by 600816 270 unt jinnie and uncle jake are insti tutions they began so far as we are concerned before time was and i can prove by the arguments that the rector at our church used last sunday for the immortality of the soul that they will endure till time shall be no more for i am sure none of us children can conceive of a world without our home as its middle and aunt jinnie and uncle jake going in and out of it aunt jinnie is mother’s only sister and uncle jake is father’s only brother so they are not related at all except through us which used to puzzle us a good deal when frank and i were young we are sixteen now and though of course frank being a boy does not seem so old as i yet for a boy he has a good deal of sense so that between us we think about things a good deal you see we are twins we are sixteen lucy is fourteen the beloved vagabond is twelve claire is ten the dude is eight the junior twins are five and baby boy is one and that is all there is of us excepting father mother and aunt jinnie and uncle jake thirteen in family we are frank and i find it wonderful that in litera ture and public speeches the family is always talked of as though it consisted of nothing but the parents and children when the fact is that almost every family that we know has one or more secondary characters as our biology teacher would call them there are the wood rufis they have a grandpa of eighty seven and a little adopted niece of eleven and the browns have three maiden aunts and the thornes have a cousin who keeps house for them with her baby even the lawrences have miss dora an elderly lady who used to be mrs lawrence’s governess and who is sup posed to live in their lodge but really stays at the big house most of the time 0 we have decided to make a systematic study of our own satellites setting down the facts about aunt jinnie and uncle jake as a contribution toward a new branch of sociology planet_ary rings or family moons we call it aunt jinnie then is just like mother but more so and while mother herself is charm ing mother exaggerated is not mother is slender aunt jinnie is gaunt mother’s man ner is reserved aunt jinnie’s is cold mother’s hair is auburn aunt jinnie's is red mother’s nose is delicately aquiline aunt jinnie’s nose is long and severe mother’s lips are delicate and but slightly curved aunt jinnie’s mouth is straight and thin lipped mother’s dark brows meet in a perplexed puzzled expression over her red brown eyes aunt jinnie’s bushy brows lower over eyes that snap we fear aunt jinnie we love mother aunt jinnie is two inches taller and three years older than mother i sometimes wonder that father see ing aunt jinnie and how much like her mother was was not afraid to marry mother lest she should grow more so too for aunt jinnie is very more so but i sup pose father thought that he would have a counteracting influence and something has had that but it seems to me that it is more her nine children than her husband just as aunt jinnie is more like mother than is mother herself so uncle jake is just like father but less so he is two years younger than father just aunt jinnie’s age and two inches shorter than father just indeed the height of aunt jinnie but he looks shorter yet the woman citizen the indefinite pi father’s hair is bushy black and his eyes bright blue uncle jake’s hair is semi brown and his eyes light blue he has less bulk less weight less mustache less nose less voice less every thing physically than father but at times you can mistake one for the other you couldn’t call him an expurgated edition of father for father doesn’t need expurgating miss rowe did call him an edition de luxe of father but she is setting her cap for him i should call him father abridged and now for their characters habitats and uses unt jinnie lives with us almost all the time sometimes when there are crises in other branches of the family she goes away for a while until the baby is born or the grandfather buried or the daughter married but generally we ourselves have an overlapping crisis before the one she is attending has climaxed and she has to rush back before she is due or oscillate between the two households trying to fill two places at once she seems always to have done this and it has marked her red face with furrows worse than nine children have worn mother’s finely lined pink cheeks grand father left a badly run down estate father says so that when it was evenly divided between mother and aunt jinnie they only got enough to pay each of them a hundred fifty dollars a year but when she stays with us father gives aunt jinnie not only a home but ten dollars a month spending money just the same as he gives mother and of course he pays all the house bills and the bills for us children and he invests and collects for aunt jinnie free of charge i heard him say so to cousin max roberts come to think though of what nora our second girl gets and does in comparison i don’t think aunt jinnie has so much to be thankful for nora gets twenty two dollars a month and a good single bed room and her keep and all of mother’s everyday clothes and lots of tips and presents as visitors come and go aunt jinnie gets ten dollars a month and a bed or a part of one all over the house as she herself may decide according to the size of the family being bigger than mother she has to buy her own clothes and nobody tips her of course she is a lady and as to work aunt jinnie well nora says this is a har r r d place but if she did half of what aunt jinnie does she might talk what with mother having babies and the babies having croup and us bigger ones having company my father believes in keeping open house bless him l and the sewing and nursing and cooking and gardening and awful times changing cooks i can tell you aunt jinnie’s hands are full you have to have two grown women in a house like ours if aunt jinnie weren’t here i’d be grown myself at sixteen i’m sure when there is a dinner party aunt jinnie takes care of the dinner and mother of the party when dudy hurts his finger aunt jinnie pulls out the splinter and mother kisses the place when i go to a party mother dresses me and aunt jinnie clears up the room when the juniors had the scarlet fever aunt jinnie went into quarantine with them while mother stayed out to take care of baby boy it has to be so in a family like ours and our two fit exactly if mother hustled more it would be horrid but i don’t know that we could spare one single one of aunt jinnie’s hustles all the same when it comes to deciding what one will be i would not care to be like aunt jinnie lucy and i have written out a liturgy for the girls of the family we say portions of it every night and all of it on sun day all the girls old enough to say it together and in it we have that we may be gentle helpless wives we beseech thee to hear us good lord from becoming capable and efficient spinsters good lord deliver us and we mean it to be a mother of nine babies may be as the new curate says to lead a con secrated life but to be aunt to nine babies seems to us much worse ncle jake has an apartment in the city where he keeps a man and he belongs to a country club where he sometimes puts up over night and he and three of his pals have a bungalow at the seashore where they stay for weeks together sometimes and where they take turns having week end parties and he has a pretty room at our house where he feels free to come and go to suit himself of course we often use the room when the house is full but we don’t usually use his bed we just put cots in so we can clear out if he happens to turn up unexpectedly he hates people to sleep in his bed he says if people have been in it since he was it feels warm to him even a week later the vagabond calls him the princess and the pea but mother says with all he does for us he has a right to be humored cousin max roberts’s wife said she supposed mother was careful not to offend him seeing what a confirmed old bachelor he is because she ex pected him to leave his savings to us children and mother was very much offended she said she thought natural affection and gratitude for what he had done for us were quite enough to account for any consideration we could show our uncle frank said cousin sallie roberts was an old cat and father said she was a gossiping woman and somehow the noun sounded quite as opprobrious as the adjective uncle jake is good to us he gives us almost all the treats we have grandfather father’s father left each of his two sons six thousand dollars apiece and they put it into a business and became partners and did pretty well father says so that they have equal incomes now f course the income that enables us to have a cook one housemaid an occasional nurse girl and a man of all work in the suburbs and clothe and feed thirteen people is enough to give uncle jake a good time and lots of spare cash and he has the good time and treats us well besides in the first place he has a fad he collects rare editions of books he keeps all his juveniles in choice bindings and with inter esting illustrations and many of them contain ing the author’s autographs in the pool room at our house and it is very pleasant to gather digitized by 600816 lo from bec01 spinsters g v yot si me of august 31 1918 e of aunt jinnic nnnolly pable and ej’icient rrd deliver us r meant a to be j innie hat you the na e case ire two duty in duty to are and to be if you no kind m grow md you elf and you out ion there of a winter’s evening and have uncle jake take them out of their locked cases one by one and tell anecdotes of how he got this or that author’s autograph or sketch by the artist father would never col lect books he says only old bachelors can afford time for hob bies neither would mother as to aunt jinnie she began collect ing a set of dickens when she was a girl like me and she just finished by the help of the children last christmas we couldn’t match her old edition though so her set begins with fat red volumes and ends with thin green ones but she doesn’t care she reads them through and begins again and never seems to tire not that dickens is all she reads she has spells of reading just as old mr wing has spells of drinking when she gets going and can’t stop sometimes after a hard day she will read the whole night through only getting a short nap towards morning and she’ll do this for several nights in succession too and comes out of what father calls her literary debauch as haggard and potted under the eyes as old mr wing at his worst everything she reads french plays english history american novels ger man philosophy latin hymns greek drama she set to last year with a dictionary and grammar to help her and translated a dutch novel just because she liked to it’s wonderful but it’s useless if ever i study five languages and sit up all night over diliicult translations it will be to get a degree but aunt jinnie isn’t even a high school graduate uncle jake says the dear lady has a masculine mind but her mind isn’t a bit like his 0 return to uncle jake he‘loves children everybody comments on it and seems to think it a wonderful thing and much to his credit well he is fond of us that’s sure he gave me a watch when i graduated from the grammar school and i’m to have a diamond ring when i graduate from the high school and a pearl neck lace if i graduate from college if i marry be fore i’m twenty five he says i shall have an electric runabout i don’t see how i am going to put off being married to do all that graduat ing but a pearl necklace is not a thing to skip if it comes in a series picnics to the bronx park with uncle jake when we are little matinées and lunches with uncle jake when we are older weeks at uncle jake’s seaside bungalow at any age are the pleasantest things that happen to us and he gives us huge tips at christmas and easter as for me when i hear people wondering why he hasn’t married and telling each other how young he is yet and what a suitable match this and that young lady would be for him i tremble an old bachelor uncle to our minds is a luxury and all of our boys have set their minds on being exactly like uncle jake when they grow up somehow when i read over what i have written about uncle jake it seems mostly com plimentary and yet it doesn’t seem fair i seem to have made him not to have any force when i marry my husband is going to have all kinds of force but he is going to let me direct it i suppose uncle jake has force he seems however not to use it much i’ve never seen him act as if he really cared about anything he acts as if it all bored him and taking trouble were not worth while but father has a high opinion of his judgment i’ve heard him say jake has business gumption when he chooses and he tells some very nice stories about how uncle jake licked the bigger boys when he was little and cried all the time uncle jake laughs about it but i don’t think he likes it to be told and he got real peeved at captain logan when he told about his crying in the war uncle jake and captain logan were in the cuban war together and captain lo gan says that uncle jake was awfully brave but when he was in action he always cried he says the soldiers said look out for the little lieu tenant when he's going to give em hell he begins to cry uncle jake was put out when he heard it he said logan’s rot we children would love to see him cry but it might cost us too much to make him mad besides we never have a show he always wants us to do pleasant things the funniest thing in our family life is the way the family is run you see we have a legal ruler like the mayor of a city the real ruler like the boss of the city that the news papers tell about and a go between father is the legal ruler he hands out the money and what he says goes if he keeps on saying it the thing is to get him to say the right thing or if he has said the wrong thing to get him to change if possible without his knowing that he has done it aunt jinnie is the boss she hasri’t any power at all as the city boss has to make the legal ruler do her bidding she can’t threaten to unseat him at the next elec tion he is appointed for life but she has the most important things for a real ruler knowledge of what ought to be done and de termination to have it done and she mostly gets it but it’s at an awful loss of time and brain work mother is the go between she is always in full sympathy with aunt jinnie but she appears always to be trying to find out what father wishes in order to fall in with his plans when the truth is he hasn’t any plans about home affairs he doesn’t know enough or care enough to have any i’ve no doubts he makes excellent plans down in the city for he is much brainier than uncle jake and somebody carries on the business all right ow i don’t mean that my mother is dis honest or my father indifferent to the needs of his family he wasn’t brought up by his mother to know about family matters i’m sure and he did not live in the country when he was a boy and he isn’t home enough to learn now and he hasn’t a head for such matters anyhow frank who has had a twin sister all his life will be a much better master of a household when he grows up he has a kind of respect for what i do and he understands quite intelligently how father has to be man aged and as to mother what can she do when father has absolute power and lots of good intentions and no knowledge and apparently no consciousness of his ignorance and cer tainly no intention of letting any woman run his show and when aunt jinnie has the whole 271 show to run and a back so stiff that all she can ever be induced to do towards managing anybody is to keep still mother simply has to exercise a serpent’si wisdom if she is a dove and she does it with patience suppose it is one of those mornings when father wakes early in the spring say and he has wandered into the garden and taken one of his sudden fits of interest in peter’s work by the way lucy says he looking up from his paper i see that peter has dug up a nice lot there on the hill fit for potatoes he has planted two rows of potatoes and i just told him to lay the whole patch down to them potatoes are going to be high next fall and we might as well raise a good lot of our own there is an awful silence in the room aunt jinnie is standing by the sideboard putting up our lunches and her back stiffens as she stands the silence is full of her protest i think to myself as i eat hot waffles that if i were to prod that silence anywhere with my fork i would withdraw the prongs dripping with aunt jinnie’s blood there is no one in the room from mother to baby boy who does not feel the air thick with aunt jinnie except father he is as unconscious as i was going to say the eat but niggie knows as the furniture and adds quite complacently the garden is doing wonderfully considering how i’ve neg lected it lately yes it is dear says mother pleasantly i’ll try to remind you to tell me more about it this evening have you time for another cup of coffee now oh oh cried the vagabond as we older children burst out on to the lawn from that breakfast did you see the old mare lay her ears back when father ploughed up her garden this morning i thought she would show her heels over the dashboard this time for sure will say that frank has considerable de cision of character in the discipline of our younger boys of course none of the grown folks know what to do with them you can’t expect it they don’t even know what they’re up to and lucy and i are really not strong enough to handle them but frank is equal to them and to spare he took the vagabond by the scruff of the neck and held his face down into the basin of the fountain until i thought the boy was certainly drowned and when he let him up he still held him firmly while he splut tered and gagged half with rage and half with suffocation young man said frank while the rest of us stood around endorsing the righteousness of the sentence and peter grinned approval from the driveway young man what is the name of the lady who kindly put up the lunch which has just spilled out of your pocket into that basin the vagabond tried a sideways spring what is her name said frank moving slowly toward the basin again aunt jinnie said the vagabond rolling his eyes viciously towards the soaking lunch do you respect her inquired frank i do responded the vagabond do you esteem her i do do you regret the use of those equine similes that's enough frank said i they are not similes they are metaphors and you shouldn’t bully i do said the vagabond so frank re leased him jumping quickly out of the way of the vagabond’s sideways kick as he did so then we all went quite happily to school to be concluded digitized by 600816 272 the woman citizen alice stone blackwell’s page high food prices one reason why ll sorts of things are happening in these days which must stimulate the wish of thoughtful women to vote take for instance the amazing revelations brought to light in the recent report of the federal trade commission which has been investigating the meat packing business it finds that the five great meat packing com panies swift armour morris cudahy and wilson not only control the meat supply of the country but have secured a practical mo nopoly over the principal substitutes for meat such as eggs cheese and vegetable oil prod ucts and they are rapidly extending that mo nopoly to cover fish and nearly every kind of food stuffs abroad and agreements with meat companies in the principal south american meat producing countries they have secured the monopoly of meat not only for the united states but for england france and italy the commission finds that this enormous power has been and is being unfairly and illegally used it has enabled the great pack ing companies 1 to manipulate live stock mar kets 2 to restrict interstate and international supplies of food 3 to control the prices of dressed meats and other foods 4 to defraud both the producers of food and the consumers 5 to crush effective competition 6 to se cure special privileges from railroads stock yard companies and municipalities and to prof iteer in every direction for a generation the meat packing companies have been defying the law and resorting to every method legal or illegal that would increase their profits these are not the assertions of an irresponsible soap box orator but the serious findings of a gov ernment commission based largely upon offi cial documents taken from the confidential files of the packing companies the huge profits made by the meat packing companies have been frequently noted in the press during the last few years in the recent official reports to congress on excess profits and profiteering the profiteering in food stuffs is declared to have been the biggest of all so far as the combined meat packing com panies are concerned the federal trade com mission recommends that the great octopus should be reached through the railroad admin istration it suggests that all the rolling stock refrigerator cars terminal stock yards and such as are necessary of the storage plants and ware houses be taken over and operated as a gov ernment monopoly affording an outlet for all manufacturers and handlers of food products on equal terms whether this would be the best solution or not it is clear that something radical ought to be done about it the present writer is not and never has been a member of the socialist party but she believes that the american peo ple irrespective of party would welcome en thusiastically very strong measures to bring down the price of food the high cost of liv ing was the all absorbing topic for several years before the war and even now it fairly divides public attention with the war those of us who realize the vital importance of winning the war moreover through investments are willing to suffer any privation that may be necessary to that great end but nobody likes to suffer privation for the enrichment of prof iteers women who never thought about a vote before are likely to wish for one when they read the report of the federal trade commis sion on the meat packers a wild coalition he rapid advance of the suffrage move ment has scared some of the opponents of equal rights into a state resembling night mare with women already able to vote for president throughout more than half the terri tory of the united states with the nation wide suffrage amendment already more than half through congress these opponents feel that the deluge is upon them and they are in a condi tion of delirium here is one mr daniel louis hanson for instance writing to the boston herald that england is in imminent danger through a coalition of the socialistic biolshevelistic forces under arthur henderson he means the british labor party and the woman suffrage element under mrs pankhurst the coalition spelling a peace with germany on germany’s terms and he sees our own country fdlow ing in the same path mrs pankhurst has been going through the united states making red hot speeches to the munition workers in which she urges them to push the war to a victorious end and casts scorn upon the supposedly pacifist tendencies of arthur henderson and the british labor party that party would undoubtedly deny that it wants peace on germany‘s terms abut however this may be any coalition between mrs pankhurst and pacifism is as unthinkable as a coalition between fire and water the assertion shows how grossly ignorant of current events some anti suffragists are and what amazing fables they are able to swallow a slander on women his same mr hanson declares that the kaiser wants all the allies to adopt woman suffrage it is a pity he cannot make his wishes known to the german voters in the united states most of whom continue to oppose it or to those prominent anti suffragists in south dakota who were lately sent to prison for their pro german activities or to that group of german americans in nebraska who are trying to get woman suffrage repealed and why is the kaiser supposed to want the united states to adopt woman suffrage listen to the amazing mr hanson he knows that the woman vote would by big majority be peace at any price at germany’s price this is a libel on american women whether suffragists or antis let mr hanson ask the first twenty women he meets whether they are in favor of peace on germany’s terms and see what they will say let any u s senator who may be inclined to attach weight to such a plea make the same experiment this libelous assumption is constantly made by the opponents of equal rights curiously enough they also assume that women can get what they want more easily with a vote than without it for years they have assured us that women do not need a vote that the majority of women'can get anything they desire by indirect influence now they intimate that a big majority of women want peace at any price and cannot get it but that they could get it if they had the ballot the whole anti suffrage argument is one spongy mass of inconsistencies women can get what they want more easily of course when they have the ballot but un less we are vastly mistaken the majority of our women do not want a german peace they believe that such a peace would be only the prelude to a whole series of wars lest we forget ain that is past is no pain someone said the reference was to the quickness with which the memory of past suffering often fades out when it is over the world has been moving so quickly of late in the direction of more equal opportunities for women that we tend to forget the hard struggles which have marked every step of the way yet it is a sur prise or would be a surprise if any inaccuracy on the part of the opponents of equal rights could surprise us to read the following in the official anti suffrage organ before the war even ultra conserva tives recognized that the few women who did not marry should in justice have every chance in the business and professional world to show their worth as individuals and as a matter of fact in most modern communities women for many years have had practically equal oppor tunities with men in every possible field of en deavor sought by them excepting only that of politics it is not necessary to go back to the hard fight that the women had who pioneered the way into the various professions in almost every kind of work the ultra conservatives have urged and still urge that the responsible and highly paid position should be reserved for men there is discrimination against women in the teaching profession in the matter of hos pital appointments in business in the govern ment service and all along the line mr and mrs john martin probably would not admit that they are ultra conservatives yet have they not assured us that every high salary paid to a woman is a distinct loss to society because it makes her less likely to marry this means of course less likely to marry for money when she has a chance to marry for love the daughter of a multimillionaire accepts it as joy fully as the poorest factory girl the 0 cial anti suffrage organ itself constantly argues against equal pay for equal work and yet it has the assurance to say that even the ultra conservatives favor giving woman equal opportunities the sunflower lunch 167 tremont street is run for the benefit of the cause by the boston equal suffrage asso ciation for good government take your lunch there recom

party by florence slown hyde member national executive committee lthough less than a year old the na tional party has members in every state and territory and will participate in the con gressional and state elections in a number of states this fall this youngest of political parties is the result of a profound conviction on the part of a goodly number of women and men from various existing parties and non partisan groups that the times demand the political union of all forward looking citi zens for the speedy and sane social and economic readjustrnents which have long been needed and which the war makes imperative it must be admitted that various groups have been crossing purposes with each other to a lamentable extent and have frequently been divided over minor questions when they should have been united politically in behalf of fundamental issues there is an ever increasing number of non partisan organiza tions each seeking some one reform and each ready to endorse candidates who are per sonally committed to their pet issues regard less of the attitude of the candidate on other vital issues or the attitude of his party on the pet issue itself this popular practice has resulted in such confusion and the repeated defeat of important welfare legislation while the ballot is impotent to speak without the aid of expensive lobbying petitions telegrams and deputations the founders of the national party seek to unite in a new political alignment the millions of women and men who are desirous of such governmental action as will secure the most widely diffused equality of opportunity in all that concerns the lives of the whole people the women voters have for the most part no long standing political allegiances and should not be guided by sentiment

possible to give only a few brief extracts in the space allotted for this article referring to labor’s power to serve civiliza tion in the present world crisis the war pro gram says in part labor whether manual or mental mechani cal managerial or professional is gaining a ruling position in all fields of society this position must be strengthened until those who do useful labor are in control of society dur ing the war this means a rapid extension of labor representation upon all bodies concerned with the management of the war and espe cially those engaged in the organization and management of war industries and in the mar keting and transportation of products this extension of the power of labor must center around the farmers organizations trade unions and the professional associations there is no other way to organize labor for social purposes the necessity for adequate protection of women and children in industry is urged in the midst of war all the the nations involved have awakened to the vital necessity of preserving and protecting human life this protection must be extended if the dire need of the war forces children and women further into industry every restriction and provision tending to protect their health and well being must be extended and maintained it will not profit us to save our institutions if we leave a physically and morally weakened

nebraska suffrage supporters to invalidate the anti suffrage referendum petition continue to bring to light hundreds upon hundreds of forgeries and misrepresentations though the suffragists have they believe far more than sufiicient evidence already they pre fer to leave no loopholes forethe enemy to gain a footing and will push on as rapidly as possible until the signatures of sixteen coun ties possibly twenty one have been thor oughly examined with this cumulative evidence so over whelmingly in our favor it would seem that the decision of the district court and public opinion at large must be on our side said mrs w e barkley president of the ne braska woman suffrage association in re counting at new york headquarters the long list of infractions of law and right that have come to light with the examination of sig natures in the counties thus far we really had enough signatures thrown out in douglas county to invalidate the anti petition but we are taking no chance and will go right on until at least 16 counties are examined ve must close by the first of october but plan to finish by the second week in sep tember when the whole case will be laid be fore the district court of lancaster county a most important step was made in this case when it was ruled by the court that all attacks should be on petition sheets and not on individual names this is following the precedent established by washington and oregon where the initiative and referendum obtain when dealing with corrupt acts on petitions by this ruling proof of the in validity of one name on the sheet invalidates the sheet forgery false names and misrepresenta tion are the three counts upon which names by the scores and hundreds have been shown to be invalid according to mrs barkley’s inter esting story to the graveyard went the antis for some of their names says some of the testimony given out of their fertile imagina tions others were born and when their case was direst they did not hesitate to represent the petition as a suffrage petition an outline of some of the evidence was sketched by mrs barkley in douglas county 1,800 names were eliminated from the petition circulated by one man another petition was thrown out entirely and a third was largely in validated out of 132 witnesses called in richardson county to testify to their signa tures 98 under oath said their names were forged needless to say this evidence threw out that petition in johnson county 8 out of 16 signatures proved to be forgeries and other names were thrown out on other counts it took long and arduous hurhing on the part of the sheriff of hall county to locate even 34 persons named on the petition the reason was that a large number of the signers of the petition were not residents of that county at the time the county papers came out with this story the democratic county convention was in session and so incensed were the dele gates at the evidence brought out they sent a delegation to the state convention pledged to suffrage there have been so many high lights so much evidence of a startling nature that it is impossible to pick out a climax as mrs barkley runs through the history of the case to date but buffalo county will be a strong contestant for dishonors in kearney buffalo county ij a _____ pf mrs v e barkley lives the man who engineered the petition work for the anti forces in the county but this did not deter the local man hired to circulate the anti petition from turning state’s evidence the local man testified he believed he was cir culating a petition asking for full suffrage and that the men who signed believed it to be a full suffrage petition to review the case of the nebraska suf fragists the 1917 legislature of that state granted the women a large measure of suf frage this aroused anti forces to the extent that they sought to invoke a referendum on the act of the legislature by circulating a peti tion they later said they had more than enough names above the required number necessary to place the suffrage measure on the ballot the suffragists started an investiga tion of the petition signatures and secured an injunction which restrained the election ofii cials from placing the measure on the ballot un til a complete examination could be made of the petition the petition by the suffragists looking to the restraining order was met by a counter peti tion from the anti forces the anti petition was signed by men and women suffragists are calling attention to the fact that the women opposing snfi’rage continue to stand by a peti tion which is shown to have been based on fraud the woman citizen in michigan wenty five state organizations of michigan have banded themselves together in a federation for the purpose of giving united and aggressive

been that the resolutions committee of the democratic county convention which met at grand island nebraska was not in favor of including endorsement of prohibition and woman suf frage among its articles of political faith but the convention was and the failure to present the resolution led to an immediate and heated debate which threatened to split the delegates into factions when the resolutions were finally adopted they included this resolved that we favor equal suffrage for all citizens regardless of sex and it was wedged between two dec larations of loyalty resolved that we place patriotism above politics and resolved that it is the supreme task of the civilized world to crush the insolent attempt of ger man autocracy to substitute a military dic tatorship for self

reconstruction discussed at the conference of the british labor party june 26 28 1918 at the central hall westminster that the conference holds that the changes in the position of women during the war in which they have rendered such good service and the importance of securing to women as to men the fullest possible opportunities for in dividual development make it necessary to pay special attention in the reconstruction programme to matters affecting women and in particu lar the conference ahirms a with regard to industry on demobiliza tion i that work or maintenance at fair rates should be provided for all women displaced from their employment to make way for men returning from service with the forces or other nation work ii that full inquiry should be made into trades and processes previously held to be un healthy or in any way unsuitable for women but now being carried on by them with a view to making recommendations as to the condi tions of their further employment in such trades iii that all women employed in trades formerly closed to them should continue to be so employed only at trade union rates of wages iv that trade unions should be urged to accept women members in all trades in which they are employed v that the principle of equal pay for equal work should be everywhere adopted g with regard to civil rights i that all legal restrictions on the entry of women to the professions on the same con ditions as men should be abrogated ii that women should have all franchises and be eligible for election to all public bodies including parliament on the same condi tions as men iii that systematic provision should be made for the inclusion of women in commit tees or commissions national or local dealing with any subjects that are not of exclusively masculine interest iv that the present unjust provision of the income tax law under which the married woman is not treated as an independent human being even in respect of her own property or earnings must be at once repealed resolutions adopted at the 27th annual session of the scandinavian grand lodge of minn i 0 g t held at holmes city minn june 20 22 1918 whereas the international order of good

its twenty seventh annual session june 20 21 22 1918 at holmes city minnesota pledges its members individually and collectively for woman suhrage and that we its members to the utmost and to the best of our abilities work to attain that end and be it further resolved that we disapprove of the recent stand taken by the american federation of labor in denying representation on its council to its women members to us it is inconsistent for such an organization not to stand for equal representation of woman with her brother in the management and important deliberations especially now and at this time when woman by her enthusiasm energy work and sacrifices in the cause of human liberties has shown herself fully the equal of man in the prosecution of the work of the government in its various

universal male suffrage about as if i suggested that every wild cat tiger lion and hyena on the globe be given the ballot she was personally a gentle kind hearted woman she had a keen active con science in general and was kind and consid erate to her own servants but she had lived under a system of government that through its suffrage law acted as if the laboring popula tion were wild animals unfit to trust with the vote until she had acquired the idea that they were exactly the kind that the law in effect de clared them to be not only do our ideals tend to come into con formity with our conduct but an ideal fostered by conduct in one field of life tends to modify our views even in other fields and bring us to commit acts that would otherwise have been abhorred the institution of human slavery in many cases resulted in better care for the slaves than they gave themselves when freed and yet slavery had to be abolished as much to protect the minds of those who owned the slaves from the corroding influence of the many indirect effects of the institutions as to protect the slaves from injustice for these reasons we men cannot quietly con tinue to keep women in a state of political slavery denying them the fundamental right to participate in their own government without blunting our own sense of justice nor can we continue to act toward woman in her civic re lations as if she were an infant or a civic imbecile without to some extent coming to ac cept this view these false views and this dulled sense of justice acquired by the con tinued performance of this act of injustice un fortunately will spread their influence far be yond the incident which gave rise to them and injuriously affect much of our thinking and living the only way continually to refine our sense of right is to live up to the highest that we now have and the sure way to dull our sense of justice and lower our ideals is to allow prejudice personal interest or cowardice to hold us back from following immediately the highest light that is in us if the men of this nation refuse to heed the light that our quickened consciences have brought to us in this hour of supreme peril that light will vanish as we slip backward and downward we must as brave free men break the shackles of tradition and every unworthy tie that binds face without blinking the dawn of this new day of freedom and justice and live up to the highest that is given us in order that we may become pure enough and strong enough to see yet more light when writing to advertisers please mention the woman citizen correspondence to rm em'roa or the woman citizen i have not before me while i write your issue of august 10 and will therefore not at temps to quote verbatim but my attention has been called to a statement therein to the effect that senator shields said at the audience which be granted to tennessee suffragists on july 26 that he had heard only the arguments of picketers up to that time i was present at the audience and while i would not attempt to say what senator shields may have privately said to others than myself i know he did not in his remarks to the dele gation as a body make such a statement my object in making this correction is three fold in the first place the assertion does an injustice to senator shields in the second place it does an injustice to the national woman’s party and last but by no means least it does a great injustice to the tennessee members of the national american woman suffrage association who i know have been more or less on the job since the year one it would not have been possible for senator shields to have made such a statement in the presence of members of the n a w s a who have labored long and hard and it is reasonable to suppose by those who are the least bit familiar with conditions in tennessee that he would not have made such a state ment since there exists between senator shields and many members of both suffrage parties in tennessee a mutual respect that is deep and lasting let me take this occasion to say to the readers of the woman citizen that when sen ator shields votes for the federal suffrage amendment it will not be because the picket ers did or didn’t or because the president did or didn’t or because of what mrs so and so and miss something or other did or said but because senator shields after weighing all the evidence adduced and all the arguments ad vanced is convinced he is that kind of man with that kind of mind the weight of the arguments mean more to him than their source every judge who ever graced a bench has had cases in which on the one side was a well trained polished star of the first magnitude while on the other side was one who may have been in the judge’s private opinion the

amendment july 2 senator gore of oklahoma took the hoor of o the united states senate to propose the following amend ment to the resolution h res 200 proposing an amendment to the constitution of the united states conferring upon women the right of suffrage 0 person other than a citizen of the united states sha l be entitled to vote for senators and representatives in congress or for electors for president and vice president of the united states house joint resolution 200 as everybody knows if he knows much reads as follows in its main provision the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on ac count of sex in sending his amendment to the desk senator gore was at pains to say that he would not insist upon it to the extent of delaying the consideration or passage of the original joint resolu tion the intent of the amendment is as senator gore pointed out to prevent unnaturalized aliens from voting for senators and representatives in congress and for electors for president and vice president i wish to say that there are eight states which permit that they might elect the controlling factor in the house of representatives and the senate and the controlling number in the electoral college south dakota’s legislators initiated a similar resolution under the recommendation of governor morbeck this spring and this autumn south dakota voters will pass on the question of requir ing full citizenship as a basis of suffrage for both men and women the aim of such a measure as senator gore’s is beyond ques tion not only desirable but necessary for the safeguarding of the americanism in american institutions as it can however be provided for in a separate resolution senator gore’s discrimina tion in stipulating that his anmendment is not to be pushed to the extent of delaying action on the federal suffrage amend ment is commendable the urgent need of american democracy at this hour is standardization and the keystone of that stan dardization in america as president wilson has pointed out is the settlement of the woman suffrage question with the settle ment of that question a common ground of full citizenship as a basis for suffrage should be found for men and women without discrimination to the women of america from the national council of women of new zealand dear sisters it is a happy omen for us that our first duty as a council is to send a double greeting to the women of your mighty 1 ederation and the women of our own motherland on the double triut‘nph of the year we take it as the happiest augury of lasting unity of heart and hand between your federation and our empire that the same day which conferred citizenship on the women of great britain conferred on you the full promise of the same right at no distant date we beg you to believe that our congratulations on your nobly won triumph are as heartfelt as those which we send to our sisters in britain the magnificent successes of the american women in social organization in intellectual development and in philanthropic endeavor have all been noted with admiration by the women of new zealand and we rejoice sincerely that this last and greatest proof of your country’s trust is now all but within your grasp at no time could your triumph have aroused more enthusiasm in great and greater britain than now when the entry of your great country may turn the balance of war towards the end of all tyranny and of all battle craft as your men and ours present to day one living wall firm as a rock against all that would destroy the genius of civilization and freedom so it has happily come to pass that free women clasp hands across the atlantic arrayed as firmly against all that threatens the sanctity of health and home and hinders the coming of the mighty commonwealth of christian nations we discern in days to be between the women of america and of britain is the unfor gotten bond of anglo saxon kinship to that is now added the mightier bond of one high charge and one high purpose the up lifting of all women and the welfare of all the earth accept then these cordial greetings from the remotest of british states as a token that the hearts of all british women rejoice with you ve are yours cordially signed k w shapparil president c k henderson hon secretary 126 the handwriting on the wall t is not often that the politics of one state furnish interest or profit to other states a possible exception arises in new york a man named elon brown has served as senator for many years in the new york legislature the browns blacks jones and smiths come and go in the politics of all states and one more in or out is a fact of no import but elon brown is a type which few states have not known and regretted his is a type which women should recognize and understand elon brown has announced that he will not stand for re elec tion whereupon the press finds cause for much comment and citizens for much reflection elon brown has been majority leader in the senate for some years and has wielded the enormous influence which such posi tions always carry for years he led the opposition to woman suffrage and 1917 state amendments were submitted in spite of his opposi tion in 1917 the committee on war measures of which he was chairman introduced a bill which provided for the suspension of all labor laws affecting men women and children during the period of the war women traveled to albany in great numbers to oppose the measure but elon brown whipped it through de spite the fact that great britain warned this nation against the effect of breaking down the safeguards which protect the labor of women and children fortunately governor nhitman of broader vision vetoed the bill but in 1918 senator brown re meanwhile the women of new york in 1915 introduced the same bill received the vote in november 1917 and when women poured in their protests again it was as potential voters and the legislature did not pass the bill senator brown successfully opposed the bill to protect girls in the messenger service in the matter of age and hours and suc ceeded in so amending it as tomake it apply only in cities of the first and second class instead of in all cities and towns i gain he blocked the elevator bill so that it never came to vote this bill was introduced at the suggestion of the state industrial commission and would haveprohibited employ ment of girls under twenty one years in the elevator service and would have restricted the hours of their work because it was not passed many girls authorities say are working all night long and some for fifteen continuous hours senator brown as majority leader led the fight in the senate against the minimum wage bill which aimed to protect the lives and morals of women and girls by the increase of wages to a standard which would make decent and healthful living possible now when mr brown sees fit to retire all the leaders and followers of humane progressive movements rejoice among those who have frankly said so are american institute for social service child labor committee of new york state commission on the church and social service of the fed eral council of the churches of christ in america v the woman citizen consumers league of new york state girls friendly society of central new york new york association for women workers north eastern field committee of young women’s chris tian association the new york state woman suffrage party the new york auxiliary of the national american women suffrage as sociation 0 ne would naturally take it for granted that all good intelli gent high minded people without exception would rejoice also that this leader of the opposition to everything women want for the protection of the home and the school the mothers and the children was about to retire yet certain newspapers of opposite politics to mr brown’s newspapers which would not admit their opposition to every detail of women’s interests loudly bewail his departure the new york times still grouchy over the adop tion of woman suffrage in new york delivers itself of the follow ing editorial comment from his return to the senate in 1913 he has shown so uni formly and brilliantly his pre eminent and profound comprehen sion of parliamentary law the processes of legislation the needs and resources of the state he has studied so attentively the annual legion of bills that he has come to occupy a place apart he is an expert curiously indifferent to the effect of his official action upon his political fortunes he is not only the he is the leader of the whole senate the wisest most experienced head in it princeps senatus he hasn’t let himself be charmed by the persuasions or bulldozed by the threats of the sodalities of republican leader of the senate he has definite principles enthusiasts the associations of fanatics the little troops and loud minorities by which our legislatures and congresses are so largely bossed if he had been as swift to let movements move him as are most of the political tribe he would have louted low to prohibition and woman suffrage he would have patted on the back every project of the coteries of busybodydom hur rah for reform everything in our polity that is old is foolish and wicked every innovation is blessed hide the wink in your so many or most politicians eye not principles but votes mr brown is of another school he is a reactionary that is a word of honorable note a distinction he new york sun throwing sweet smelling bouquets to mr brown declares that he cannot be allowed to go so easily it is to be very sincerely hoped that senator brown may reconsider his decision this expression of admiration and confidence in the man who has never been known to serve any but machine measures of the stand pat kind what does it mean why should newspapers of opposite political faith find him so necessary to the welfare of new york while the tribune of his own party declares that he has been a liability to his party and a hindrance that the public will be better off without him in ofiice one need not search far for the explanation and there is a job to be done a vote to be driven through the senate and an experi digitized by 600816 july 13 1918 enced trusty hand at the whip will go a long way toward accom that something is to send the federal prohibition amendment to referendum in some form the woman vote the untried untested vote of a possible million and a half of women what will it do no one knows therefore keep it ignorant of the plan so far as possible keep prohibition out of sight and the federal suffrage amendment in the background talk of otlfer issues get the women to divide on candidates in each party keep them talking about men in order that they may forget measures it is a scheme which has enabled machines to work wonders with men can it be depended upon to dupe women so the advocates of the job to be done long for senator brown with his long blackjack which has cracked many a reform meas ure to defeat in past years that is the story for all the women of the nation to learn some brown or jones or smith will occupy the same position in every state but in many the women will have no vote to support the measures these leaders will oppose therefore they will have a free field mr brown sees the handwriting on the wall and knows that the day for such as he is gone and therefore volun plishing it tarin retires those who regret the coming of woman suffrage regret the departureof mr brown and vice versa the woman citizen warns women to be on guard to be watch ful of political slight of hand performances voting is not merely giving consent of the governed it is guarding the nation against tricks the suffrage amendment of all free peoples l is not merely our fourth of july which has become the in dependence day of all the free peoples of the earth it is our ideals of government which are becoming international it is among other things the federal suffrage amendment to the constitution of the united states which has become a test ques tion of woman’s political freedom the world over europe is receptive to all things american as never before witness paris renaming the avenue trocadero for the president of the united states witness mr vvells’s in the fourth year where mr wilson’s expressions about the war aims of the allies are quoted as the greatest contribution to the world’s understanding of the allied cause the americanization of the war mr wells hails with applause this from wells who has been wont to find american habits food for jest an indica tion of how far mr vvilson’s frank acknowledgment of suffrage for women as a part of the democracy for which the world is fighting has carried was shown by the attention given his reply to the memorial of the women of europe at a recent meeting in paris of the sociaiist group in parliament at this meeting'it was decided to ask for the appointment of a committee of parlia ment to consider and report upon the'question of universal suf frage for france last week the national woman suffrage publishing com pany received an order from g p putnam’s sons for a number of copies of mrs catt’s book vomen suffrage by 127 federal constitutional amendment explaining that these books are part of an order for export to south america the books being donated by the carnegie endowment for inter national peace one copy of each being sent to a national library in lima santiago rio de janeiro and montevideo it begins to seem as if the national enfranchisement of amer ican women is of vital concern to all the world as one of the ex isn’t it about time that the united states senate began to comprehend pressions of the americanization of international aims this americanization which the rest of the world holds so dear hungarian women want votes premier wekerle of hungary is again determined to introduce a woman suffrage clause into the hungarian elec toral reforms bill his ministry previously suffered from its determination to favor equal franchise measures but the premier is evidently supported in his effort by the wishes of hungarian women according to a budapest telegram printed in the dutch newspapers of july 8 the premier made a public promise to a deputation of women

of the united states as he practically does it must be a hardy senator especially of his own party who resists it post charleston s c he public is still interested in getting from baird an answer to the question why in the face of your public pledge to stand by the president’s war program are you doing everything in your power to defeat the woman suffrage amendment which is one of the important items in the program that you vowed you would help carry out when governor edge appointed you to the senate vacancy times trenton n j otwithstan ding the earnest support received from president wilson a little group of reactionary democrats in the senate has been able to hold up the federal amendment providing for woman suffrage because a large number of democrats in the senate members of the president’s own party men who like to call themselves democrats but who have failed to catch the spirit of true democ racy because these men have refused to act like genuine demo crats the friends of woman suffrage have been fearful of bringing the measure to a vote in the senate woman suffrage is an essential part of democracy there is only a partial democracy where only a part of the people have a voice in the selection of officials or the making of laws presi dent wilson recognizes these facts although many of the leading members of his party occupying seats in the united states senate are of the opinion that only a portion of the people are entitled to enjoy the blessings of democracy tribune los angeles cal digitized by 600816 the story mrs raymond brown has brought back from france is a thrilling one and one which ought to gladden every suffragist and make proud the heart of every american woman suffragist or not for it is the same kind of story that is filling the united states with pride in her boys in france a steadily growing record ofhonest work and modest merit and splendid recognition of services bravely done i it is also in miniature the history of women's changed status in war time the women’s oversea hospitals u s a were offered to the french government in the summer of 1917 they were accepted with the wonderful courtesy and appreciation of the french but it was only after interminable 16 lays that the first unit reached france early in march this year before the first great german offensive began they had been designated to the town of guiscard but this was taken over by the british at about that time and the unit was shut out as under new english rulings no civilian relief was allowed inside the british war zones next the unit was about to in despatched to vic sur aisnes when the tide of battle swept vic sur aisues out of the allies hands the german drive found a staff of 12 wo men doctors nurses and aides in an army camion en route for a military hospital near the front lines which was evacuated while they were on the way to it thus they were side tracked to a great military hospital where they made an unexpected arrival at nightfall the surgeons expecting a medical staff were aston ished beyond words to find no one but wonien women surgeons they roared derisively think of sending women as military surg eons woman doctors were still disregarded in france as in the united states as they had been at first in great britain that was in march vous savez in june this is what dr olga povitzky wrote mrs raymond brown then in paris our women have been on duty 24 hours at a stretch in the last drive ley is assisting dr picot the great french frac ture surgeon who lets her do a great deal of independent work in the operating room and wards dr sholly assists another surgeon and has charge of his post operative wards the same is true of dr mary edward who assists dr fin a movable hospital ready to start a third surgeon the work of miss mckee and the aides under her is highly commended by all n three months the women of the hospitals which belong to the national american woman suffrage association had justified not only themselves and the association backing them but the case of the professional woman for military hospital work but to go a long way hack to that tirst lone some night when the staff was dropped down as it were from the skies upon a military hos pital which wasn’t sure it wanted them they were put to sleep in a great salon in what had once been a chateau rivalling ver sailles they could look up up and watch gay little cupids painted on the ceiling and softly tapestried walls and think of these things as the kind of environment men thought suited to the woman citizen women before the war game proved women for what they are human beings sharing and bearing the world’s burdens for one day of idleness they served a kind of test of whether they would do or not then the war itself settled their fate for them as it has been settling the fate of women everywhere wounded men began coming in so fast that there was no longer any time to think of men people or women people just of human needs in the first 36 hours of this rush 650 cases were evacuated the american staff stopped at nothing they did the hardest work the roughest work undressing men with the mud of the trenches still on them and getting them ready for operations doctors worked like nurses with no fussing over dignities and nurses worked like orderlies with the help of priests they just made them selves essential to that

anti climax of the battle spirit w'e have been working at white heat day and night getting a little rest when we could we have the preparation ward aside from the tent and no sooner are the beds vacated than they are refilled we are now the doctors i mean doing regular military surgery reported dr finley in may with positions equal to those of french army surgeons the chef de frac ture is already giving me major operations i have a french army doctor who does not do surgery to help me and i find the work though arduous most profitable we have an american équipe of nurses at last working very hard really doing more than they ought but every one is overworking their work is fine and i am proud of them on june 10 after the great drive dr finley wrote again i have just finished nineteen hours in the operating room assisting the chef de fractures of the third army division the news is bad today but our women are steady ne are all working under such extreme pressure just now that it is impossible to get together for a unit meeting but talking to them separately i find not one who wishes to leave for a safer place or easier work it makes me very proud of our american women his is the usual story at another time dr finley reported that she had just put in about twenty hours in the operating room and the aides were there still again we are very busy hospitals nearer the front are being evacu ated here and we are also getting men direct from the field there were 25 operations last night besides othefcases dr sholly oper ated until three this morning and our nurses

to dr tessier the best known authority on war bacteriology he inside the barracks a fracture ard hospital force at labouheyre 129 nurses of the women’s oversea hospitals u s a wants me to get from him the most important points on this particular branch of bacteriology i am certainly highly flattered with the confi dence this highly critical gentleman bestows on an american woman bacteriologist and what a splendid opportunity to make good he military unit of the suffrage hospitals is in the compiégne district it is on one of the routes which german air planes take when they go to bombard paris the chateau stands on an exposed hill open to the sky and the american women are lodged in the high french roof over their heads travel the dreadful bomb throwing machines which these doctors and nurses know will spare no hospitals yet when the time came to sign up for a new six months contract with the national suffrage hospitals not one nurse thought of faltering it is not in courage and skill alone that this unit has made its record when mrs brown ar rived at chateau ognon she found the nurses and doctors shampooing each other’s hair blacking each other’s boots and darning each other’s stockings for francs which they put in a common purse for what to buy delicacies for their patients one of her first requests after she returned to america was for a special fund for a simple diet kitchen so that wounded poilus may have hot chocolate and fresh fruit or any other little extra luxury they need such is the personnel of the women’s mili tary unit serving in a base hospital of 1,000 beds in the fighting zone of france but not all the service and sacrifice is in the military équipe while the military unit was requisitioned by the french service de santé for the wounded another set of war victims is being cared for in southern france by the rest of the w omen’s oversea hospitals staff these are the pitiful refugees fugitives from their own villages of which there are 10.000 in the department of landes alone the medical work for this entire group is to be put into the hands of the second division of the suffrage this now in cludes a small hospital built by german prison ers in the grounds of the mayor of the town whose story has been told at length in the pages continued on page 132 such a diet kitchen under‘the care of miss alice finley is now on the way to

in south dakota have passed strong resolutions endorsing woman sufrage amendments state and federal u he completion of democracy at home may depend upon your patriotism when the vote on the susan b anthony amendment is taken this was the message sent senator penrose by the suffragists of pennsylvania probably the shortest message ever sent senator pen rose concerning a momentous measure is the way the press refers to it in a telegram to senators knox and pen rose the pennsylvania woman suffrage asso ciation called attention to the fact that the association represents 150,000 enrolled mem bers and added favorable action is urged upon you because the passage of the measure is necessary to the success of america’s war program and in jus tice to the women of pennsylvania who de serve the same recognition that has been ac corded the women of other great states and which has been given to six million women in england the submission of the suffrage ques tion to the'vdters of pennsylvania in 1915 showed that 46.3 per cent of the voters ap proved of enfranchising the women and the spread of the sentiment is such that it is clearly your duty to vote favorably upon the measure the part the women of pennsylvania have taken in war service was brought out in a let ter from the pittsburgh suffrage association to senator knox prior to the expected vote in the senate june 26 the letter read in part concerning pennsylvania in particular and the war work women are doing may we not mention the parade of the women war workers in the pittsburgh district which featured the third liberty loan campaign according to newspaper estimates there were aprpoximately 40,000 women in line including those working in plants making war materials red cross workers war savings stamp campaigners lib erty loan workers and women of the various divisions of the women’s committee council of national defense of course these women were only a comparatively small representative proportion of those actively engaged in patri otic work later the newspapers estimated during the red cross campaign that a similar number of women demonstrated by another parade the thousands engaged in this work of mercy in connection with the last liberty loan campaign we are glad to bring to your attention the fact that the women of your state penn sylvania raised nearly 136,000,000 those of allegheny county raising 37,000,000 more than double their quota and those of philadelphia exceeding 50,000,000 will you not advise us what stand you will take ve feel it inevitable and many of the far seeing men of the country have expressed the same view to us that the women of the united states will be enfranehised as penn sylvania women we hope that when the record of the completion of democracy is written it will not have our pennsylvania senators re corded as opposed to a justice which parallels all that upwn which our republic is liascnlf uring the recent drive for the amendment tennessee suffragists

literary political and philanthropic clubs securing protests resolutions and getting petitions signed they bombarded their senators with these as well as scores of telegrams letters and favor able

and dr sophie nevin the dentist now on the spot has already a huge practice mrs brown reports finding 35 patients wait ing in dr nevin’s ante room when she went to see her dr nevin is probably the first mili tary woman dentist having had the unique ex perience of caring for soldiers in the united states army when she landed in bordeaux she found that her utensils had been side tracked in the meantime an american regi ment quartered within reasonable distance of the unit had an equipment and no dentist so dr nevin was borrowed and has been doing such fine work for the american regiment that the commanding officer of the army camp has requested that she give regularly three days a week to the american soldiers mrs brown saved her grand coup until the last owing to the increasing need for care of gas patients the french government has asked for a new unit of the women’s oversea hospitals u s a for first aid work at the front for gas victims mrs brown’s return is for the special purpose of‘selecting the personnel for a 300 bed hospital for gas patients the hospital to be given by the french government and a daily maintenance to be paid by them for each patient a staff of at least fifty members will be needed for this new hospital which will be a mobile unit the gas treatment is simple and can be quickly taught to nurses and doctors at paris but as gas hospitals must follow the movements of the army and keep as near the front lines as possible where the patients can be rushed to them for help they.are posts full of danger mrs brown reported that the chateau ognon unit would cost about 15,000 for the year the labouheyre increased unit will cost about 100 000 for a year’s upkeep funds for which are already generously subscribed by the women’s apparel unit business women of the garment trades the new gas unit is estimated to cost 75,000 for the year’s work this will not exceed the fund asked for by the national american voman suffrage association for its hospital work in france as mrs brown gave her report to the execu tive committee of the national american voman suffrage association and to the cen tral committee for the hospitals every person present lifted her head with a renewed sense of pride in the splendid attainments of the women who are representing the suffragists of america in active service at the war front continued on page 138

defenses against the higher education of women in all this stir about new opportunities for women the world of to day is inclined to for get those who with all the tides setting dead against them made their own opportunities when girls are trotting about in government uniforms who remembers that maria mitchell was in the coast survey long before she began inventing comets to blaze her name across the heavens her father who earned the fabulous salary of 100 a year in the united states coast sur ch in addition to 2 a week for teaching school believing that girls should have the same chance for an education as boys taught his small daughter maria what he knew about naviga tion as well as coast surveying until she was able to take her place as his assistant it was in october 1847 that she discovered the comet that bears her name and for the dis covery of which she received the gold medal from frederick vi of denmark in spite of the fact that newspapers were full of comments about miss mitchell’s comet she kept on as librarian in nantucket compil ing the nautical almanac every year and writ ing for scientific periodicals in 1857 she went to england and was made much of by sir john hershel and alexander von humboldt when vassar college was opened in 1865 maria mitchell‘was given the chair of astron omy for another score of years she lived in vassar’s observatory a person of

the only credential miss furness will carry the council of women represents an old established institution in america which was effective for service in the piping times of peace the woman’s committee

photo graphs to explain american collective methods of health protection the american collegiate alumnae hopes also to stimulate a branch in japan having many colleagues in that country among japanese women students who have been graduated from all the women’s colleges of america in canada there is a branch of the american collegiate alumnae and it is expected that japan will fol low the sisterly

once famous novelu robert elsmere gave to all the orthodox religious world and'she tells us how mr gladstone re monstrated with her white with wrath an effort has lately been made to stir up prejudice against woman suffrage at the south by recalling to public attention elizabeth cady stanton’s almost forgotten book the wom an’s bible mrs stanton’s theological views were much the same as mrs ward’s our anti suffrage friends true to their habit of in sisting upon a double standard of ethics one for themselves and another for their oppon ents would never admit that the anti suffrage movement ought to be branded as irreligious because of mrs humphrey ward yet the anti suffrage association never disclaimed re sponsibility for robert elsmere while the national american woman suffrage associa tion did adopt a resolution that it had no respon sibility for the woman's bible the plain fact is that both the suffrage move ment and the anti suffrage movement have in cluded prominent men and women of every shade of religious opinion from roman cath olics to agnostics there is no more cause for singling out mrs stanton’s views as typical than those of the pious quaker preacher lu cretia mott or the eloquent methodist preacher dr anna howard shaw the practical question is whether woman suf frage has tended to good or evil in the places where it prevails after more than forty years experience of municipal woman suffrage in england the solid vote of the bishops and archbishops in parliament was cast in favor of the recent bill which gave women the par liamentary vote and in our own enfranchised states an overwhelming majority of the min isters of all denominations agree that equal suf frage has been a good thing there is also the indisputable fact that all the liquor and vice interests are arrayed against the suffrage cause it is only the most reactionary and short sightcd brand of piety that can wish to line it self up with these wanted all around loyalty lready the political pot is beginning to boil we are told by many politicians that in the coming fall elections there should be but one issue the americanism of the candidates we have a mighty war upon our hands a war upon the issue of which hangs the destiny of the world it is imperative that every can didate should be a man or woman of staunch loyalty but it is equally important that this should be an all around loyalty which can be trusted to defend the country not only against the foe in front but against the enemies in the rear according to tradition there was many years ago a group of harvard students who had more appetite than honesty when they wanted a chicken supper they used to divide their forces a s b s page n the nation’s birthday july 4 the con stitutional convention bf arkansas de clared for the complete emancipation of women the proposed section for the revised state constitution begins the rights of citizens of this state to vote and hold og‘ice shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex both male and female citi zens of this state shall enjoyequally all civil political and religious rights and privileges part of them would take their stand in the evening in front of some farm house and sing college songs when they had drawn all the family to the front door to listen the others would go through the chicken house at the back and help themselves to a few fat fowls some politicians with a most unsavory record for plundering the people are now singing the star spangled banner vociferously for the express purpose of diverting attention from their plans to skin the public the women should keep an eye upon them a german spy or an american prohteer can sing america as loudly as a true patriot in the early days of equal suffrage in new zealand crooked politicians and scaly persons in general were much annoyed because the women’s vote was governed mostly by the char acter and record of the candidates in a letter to the newspapers one man complained bitterly of this unreasonable feminine tendency he said if a man is an incomparable financier and a country whose finances are terribly tangled can employ him it ought not to matter that he once stole a horse but the women persisted in thinking that a man who had once stolen a horse might steal the contents of a treasury he battle between corrupt politics and the public weal goes on night and day it no more lets up in war time than does the strug gle for profits in fact it grows keener and more dangerous in war time because of the greater opportunities to put something over on the people while they are looking another way truly patriotic men and women can no more afford because it is war time to let up on their end of the fight against corrupt politics and re actionary policies than to let up on the tight against tuberculosis or infant mortality the next congress will have to settle most momentous issues it is unspeakably important that it should be made up of members who are both honest and clear sighted it is not enough that a candidate should shout against the germans that is an easy thing to do and it is often done as a blind by those persons whose motto it is to prey without ceasing look at the candidate’s record see to it that he is not only loyal but a man of conscience and courage and of broad enlightened views stupidity often works as much harm as dis honesty a man may profess to be an ardent patriot and may even believe that he is one and yet may make the sort of congressman or legislator who will vote for measures most disastrous to the public good generally speaking a man who has not sense the woman citizen enough and justice enough to see that woman suffrage is right has not sutiicient brains or sufliciently modern brains to be trusted to make an enlightened decision on other ques tions that will come before him we ought to demand this as an irreducible minimum we want americanism but all around amer icanism the kind that can see and fight against dangers at home as well as abroad not pa triotism alone but intelligent patriotism is what we need and must have in order to win this war a nation of martyrs omen who are to be voters need to know what is going on in the world around them a great amount of valuable information is compressed into a book lately issued by fleming h revell company armenia a martyr nation by dr m c gabrielian it is an historical sketch of the armenian people from the earliest times to the present day of all the crimes committed during the great war the blackest has been the colossal crime of the turkish government against the armenians with the connivance and support of germany and the recent events terrible as they have been were only the climax of centuries of persecution but the tragic story is lighted up by many gleams of heroism and the women showed their full share of courage miss corinna shattuck the noble american missionary was alone in the city of urfa dur ing the massacres of 1895 she wrote it was apparent that the utmost was done by the officials to protect me but how willingly i would have died that thousands of parents might be spared to their children it is stated that 240 persons were saved from the massacre by her special efforts again and again beautiful armenian women and girls were oeered their lives if they would become mohammetans but they refused all through the history runs the dark thread of outrage against women as dr j lepsius wrote in describing the massacres of 1895 not to be compared for vastness and atrocity to those of the last few years there was no massacre in which the murder of the men was not followed by outrage on the women and girls no plunder in which they were not offered for sale carried on as spoils exchanged for horses'and donkeys or

in order to promote unity between the nations allied in the world war for democracy the emergency council on education representing the leading education organizations of the united states offered one hundred scholar ships to french women and the offer has been accepted by the french government in the space of half a generation inter nationalism has replaced the tie of common blood democracy has

of our men n the grain growers association one of the most powerful organizations of western canada women are entitled to exactly the same standing as men for certain purposes how ever special women’s sections are provided to do special work the objects of these sections as set forth at the last annual meeting of the association are to establish libraries literary societies read ing rooms arrange lectures and to further ex tend the knowledge of the members and their families along social and economic lines with a view of elevating the standard of living in the rural communities to encourage members to provide suitable halls and meeting places and properly equip and furnish the same for the social and educa tional benefits of the members to foster and encourage the co operative method of distribution of farm products and the supplying of staple commodities to make farm life more attractive thereby keeping the young people on the farm to beautify the home the home surround ings and the school to increase the eliiciency of the home keeper and raise the ideal of home life and work to work for better school boards with women among the trustees to ascertain the views of the members of the provincial legislature on questions directly affecting farm women to foster and develop local taste for litera ture music and the finer things of life ir r n vb miss edith diehl hatever else has been demonstrated by the incursion of women into the war it is proved that they can do farm work with every disadvantage of inexperience muscles not yet geared to high speed with a pitchfork and with all their previous conditions of servitude to unsuitable clothing still the woman farmer has been an ever present help in time of need in a fourth of july parade somewhere in new jersey the land army division carried a ban ner saying that it had earned in cash 2,650 this was after two months of active operation in a camp starting with 18 workers and now booking 75 girls a day to farmers whose orders are coming in faster than they can be filled what this second year of successful experi ment with women on the land has demon strated says the oliicial bulletin of the wom an’s land army of america is the need of an experiment station where leaders for the necessary type of farm camp can be trained no sooner did this need become manifest than w'ellesley college stepped into the breach and offered its institution for an ofhcers train ing school in augustof this year the plan of the wellesley college training camp is to be that of a normal class it will re produce camp conditions in every respect and give the students experience in problems of unit organization camp housing food water supply sanitation camp regime and agricultural prac tice with detailed courses of instruction by ex perts in all these subjects there will be courses in farm mechanics including carpentry and the use of concrete standardization in co ordinating the size and type of farm implements with woman’s physique is the central idea an outstanding feature of this year’s work has been a demonstration of willingness to en list for farm work on the part of the young women of the country but an almost appalling need of adjustment of means to ends scarcely two camps have met identical condi tions girls are housed in old farm houses in tents in shacks and in institutions converted into barracks 135 a plattsburg for the land army n some places the water supply has been a problem in others it is drainage or repairs and always it is transportation the director of the training camp is miss edith diehl of new york a former student of wellesley who is well known as a hand book binder and who since the beginning of the war has been connected with the american red cross as director of the auxiliary work room in the new york county chapter the personnel of instruction will consist of experts from agricultural colleges from technical schools for men and women and from govern ment institutions which are asked to detail instructors for this service 155 diehl disclaims any intention to set up an agricultural school although some argricultural training will be given the model camp will try to meet every problem of a real camp so as to be able to furnish a definite basis of type cost and management for 1919 farm camps that this training is to be offered to recruits from the entire nation makes it of interest to every branch of the woman’s land army of america the cordial cooperation of miss ellen f pendleton president and of the entire board of trustees of wellesley has met with an enthusiastic response at a recent conference of state chairmen held in new york city a message of appreciation to wellseley authorities was sent on behalf of the states by the chairman of the meeting and every state chairman has promised on return ing to her state to send as good a representa tion as possible to the training camp so that it may be a national group all women of sound health who have had either executive experience or collegiate train ing and who wish to give their services on the land another year are eligible for the course and it is hoped to start the camp august first with at least sixty women the expense to each recruit will be only 50 the cost of equipping the camp and underwriting it for a sufhcient amount to make it a hundred per cent ehicient will be borne by the college owing to the necessary limits in size all those desiring to register should make application at once to the director at wellesley college wellesley mass women legislators woman has been

will be held on august 27 136 the woman citizen your vote and the laws he laws under which the voter governs and is governed are passed in one of four ways namely by local governments by state legislative bodies by initiative and referendum of the people and by the congress of the united states the possibilities of legislation by local ordi nance are as has been pointed out before extremely limitedf lawmaking by state legislative bodies is by far the commonest method forty eight state legislatures make the vast bulk of our laws lawmaking by the voter through his vote in the citizens initiative and referendum has been spoken of many times in our articles on government as part of the movement toward direct as opposed to representative government south dakota first in 1898 provided for the initiative and referendum since then state wide initiative and referendum measures have been passed by oregon nevada montana oklahoma maine missouri michigan ar kansas colorado arizona ohio california nebraska w'ashington north dakota missis sippi kansas utah and louisiana new mex ico and maryland have state wide referendum but no initiative in addition the cities of twenty two other states have some form of referendum in many cases combined with the initiative only in vermont delaware rhode island and indiana have no beginnings of direct legislation been made the initiative and referendum does not aim to cover all lawmaking compared with the multitude of laws on our statute books passed by our leg islatures we have few people’s laws the initiative and referendum is essentially a power of the people held in reserve by which they may obtain laws withheld from them by legis latures or recall legislative acts which are un pleasing to them a certain amount of legislation a small amount for the method is dihicult is passed by amendment to state constitutions passing the legislature first and the vote of the people afterwards this is the oldest but the least common form of legislation by referendum state provision for initiative and referendum itself is alv’vays made in this way he best form of initiative and referendum amendments provides first that on the petition of a certain number of voters who believe that a given act of the legislature is unpleasing to the people that measure can be placed before these people’s referendum vote referred to them and sustained or recalled in accordance with their yes or no majority second if a law fails to pass the legislature it may by petition be placed before the people and passed by them in spite of the legislature third a law that has never come before the legislature can by motion of the people themselves their initiative be placed by petition on the ballot and passed by their vote alone without reference to the legislature through this threefold power of the voters themselves ac cording to one authority in the forty four of our states listed above a great body of use edwin s potter in case and comment january 1918 a by mary su’mner boyd ful legislation has been obtained by means of the initiative and a considerable number of bad laws enacted by state or municipal legislative bodies have been held up or killed by the voters through the referendum the last method of legislating is through the congress of the united states congress passes all laws designed strictly to carry out the powers granted the united states govern ment in its constitution of late years also there has been a growing tendency to stretch the meaning of various clauses of the consti tution so as to make them cover legislation of general importance to all the people or to large bodies of people as citizens of the united states regardless of state lines this broad ening of the scope of the national government was one of the planks of the progressive plat form in 1912 ne of the great problems of legislation in the united states is the diversity of state laws some diversity is called for by the totally different needs of localities which differ socially and industrially a considerable amount of this diversity is however due to the fact that much state legislation is prepared by men of no special training or capacity for the task and is often drawn up in haste another reason for diversity is the fact that when no model forms are of general acceptance in draw ing up a certain law some special interest dominant in a state can often dictate the terms of that law this lack of uniformity in many cases puts one state at a disadvantage with respect to another thus when some of the n ew england states after long agitation against bad conditions passed decent child labor laws the cotton textile industry migrated to a large extent to southern states where there were either very rudimentary child labor laws or none at all there have been two methods suggested for unifying state laws so that they shall not reflect local discrimination but equal justice through out the united states one method has been educational in 1892 a body of commissioners was formed at the instance of the american bar association to work for uniform state laws their work was twofold to draw upon the best legal ability of the country to frame those laws which ought to be uniform through out the united states and to push these laws in the forty eight state legislatures the com missioners who are generally appointed by the legislatures of the‘various states have made some progress but in view of the fact that in a five year period the american bar associa tion tells us that no less than 62,014 statutes are passed by our legislatures it is evident that one comparatively small body working for this object cannot make a very great im pression furthermore on many subjects of legislation the movement for uniform laws would encounter strong opposition business men in those southern states for instance which were thriving on a textile industry built on bad child labor laws would fight a model law on this subject tooth and nail digitized by 600816 n those technical matters which will make the details of business uniform the uniform state law movement has made most headway already fifty states and territories have passed the negotiable instruments act drawn up by the committee and forty one the uniform ware house receipts act and so of other acts in the commercial or financial field the committee has stood behind twenty seven different acts only nine of which were not in these fields and these nine have made small progress in the legislatures acts says the secretary of the commission which the conference has ap proved on social matters have not met with great favor it is in connection with such matters as these dealing with human welfare which special in terests in some states may oppose that the recent extension of the field of federal legis lation is of most importance since the beginning of the republic but most prominently since the years leading up to the civil var the states rights issue has existed between state and nation with respect to the negro it was settled in favor of the nation since then it has come up in connection with proposed federal legislation some legislation covering subjects formerly left to the states has been passed under various clauses of the constitution but again and again states rights prevents other legislation or throws out by court decision laws actually passed a law preventing the making of poisonous phosphorus matches by imposing a heavy fed eral tax was passed in 1912 this was based on a decision of the supreme court in the so called oleomargarine case to the effect that the taxing power of congress knows no limits except those imposed by the constitution and cannot be restrained because of the results which may follow from its exercise that is to say even if the application of this taxing power results in the regulation of an industry carried on within a state he pure food law forbade interstate com merce in adulterated foods in 1916 the national child labor committee secured the passage of a law forbidding transportation in interstate commerce of the product of the factory labor of children who were either under fourteen years of age or who worked more than eight hours a day or whose employment was performed under certain other bad condi tions this was in june 1918 declared un constitutional by the united states supreme court on the ground that the grant of power to congress over the subject of interstate com merce was to enable it to regulate such com merce and not to give it authority to control the states in their exercise of the police power over local trade and manufacture this decision came as a setback to those who are trying to protect the national welfare by national legislation but the halting of social legislation through national channels is only temporary the taxing power can be invoked as it was to protect workmen working with dangerous phosphorus and a law based on this power as the oleomargarine case shows has chance of passing the review of the court continued on page 138 july 13 1918 137 journal of a y worker f anybody had told me i should ever be i selling soft drinks and cigarettes over a counter i shouldn't have believed it but if you could only see our ministers and college pro fessors worrying themselves sick if they don’t have cigarettes enough for the men and rejoic ing uproariously over a new shipment of chew ing gum you would be amused but out here our one idea is to give the men what they want and give it to them in the best way it would do your heart good to see how they clamor for hot chocolate and would apparently rather have it than all the things they can get in the cafes down town i’m sure i could make french change in my sleep now if all else fails i can run a grocery store when i get home i am now occupied in gathering up all the tin boxes i can get painting them black and putting cubist flowers on them to keep the things in that we sell they will make our shelves won derfully gay today we have had a great bunch of lilacs at either end of the counter and butter cups in the middle and everybody was crazy about them i haven’t told you much about the canteen yet it’s one of the finest and splendidly or ganized now the two women who did all that are organizing another canteen for the officers and have turned this over to us we have five women in the kitchen and madame telamon the american wife of a french officer here sees to all the marketing and all the necessary negotiations in french she’s a very charming woman and a great help her husband was at one time a professor in ann arbor and is perfectly delightful he has been wounded a time or two and as he expressed it at the hospital they kept opening him up and shutting him up in the same place until he finally sug gested to the doctor that a button and button hole would be much more convenient for every body concerned than so much cutting he hut is very large really a double one in half of it the boys may gather to read write or eat at the big tables the other half is an auditorium where there is some sort of pro gram every night the counter where we sell things is at one end of the first room we try to arrange to have one woman on the canteen all the time in addition to one or two secre taries and volunteer help at the rush hours miss thomas and i work on two hour shifts from nine in the morning till eight at night for two of those off hours we work about the building at various things and two hours in the afternoon we are supposed to rest but there are always such interesting things to do at the canteen that it’s hard to get away already we have made costumes for theatricals drawn a map of the philippines for a lecture indexed books for the library worked on the bulletin boards mended clothes and a thousand and one other little things it’s wonderful fun some hours in the day we have such a long line waiting for things that there is no time to get in a word edgewise other times the counter is freer and the men have their cup of chocolate and talk about everything under the sun from wishing they had ice cream sodas to their experiences in the trenches and their girls at home they just have to talk to somebody and we are the only women here four of us to as many thousand men qualifying for a grocery store by helen perry i’m so glad that i’m with the enlisted men though instead of the officers as they have so many more resources in themselves and don’t need us half as much yesterday a boy came in who had not talked with an american woman for almost a year others have not talked to them for months others have just come from america and are having their first siege of homesickness with no mail one man who has a brother wounded in the hospital and has heard neither from him nor from home for some time comes and talks to me because i look like his sister another hangs around for some time and finally tells me bashfully in a stage whisper that i am losing a hairpin and they are hard to get over here our chief duty at present consists of stand ing behind a counter and selling coffee choco late cigarettes cookies toothbrushes shoe strings and the like to several thousand boys a day there are lots of volunteer helpers from among the nomeommissioned oliicers of the headquarters staff who are not very busy i wish you could see our canteen instead of just hearing about it most of the things that happen are not interesting except as you get them first hand the stories of the men just back from the front the little things that they like to talk about the pictures of their wives and sweethearts and sometimes children the things they tell us because they just have totell a woman and we happen to be the only ones handy some of the talks i have had already perhaps not more than a minute or two long have made my coming wonderfully worth while it is astonishing how many things you can fit in with serving chocolate and selling cigarettes sometimes we can get no supplies to sell and its hard to have to stand there and refuse things to boys who have just come in out of the cold or who have a long march or drive before them but everybody is good natured and you’d be astonished at the nice spirit with which everybody takes things out here they say that one reason that they want a woman on the canteen all the time is because the men are much more patient and much less profane if there is a woman around we are going to try and have cold drinks as the days get warmer but ice and sugar are scarce and i don’t know how we’ll come out some days i have so many souvenirs given me that i rattle when i walk i’ve already started bulletin boards for original sketches and cartoons by the men themselves and another for verses you’d be surprised to see what a lot of really good stuff we get and our local talent for entertainments it has any college i know beaten a mile we not only have a wonderful band mandolin clubs and professional soloists and musicians but tightrope walkers circus performers professional actors artists to say nothing of men of scientific and technical train ing of various sorts we have an entertainment of some sort every night either by local or imported talent it’s astonishing the sort of people we are constantly meeting out here last week judge lindsay and winifred holt the lighthouse person both turned up the same day the last three evenings we have had lectures by dr vincent of minnesota university by a frenchman who visited america with joffre and viviani and by dr daly of har vard university who is one of our workers out at the hospital the men connected with our hut are college professors pastors of promi nent churches business men chauffeurs movie experts accountants etc and most of them are an unusually fine type of men we are not only the central hut here at headquarters but the divisional center for some twenty small towns and camps surrounding us so you can imagine how many intéresting things are con stantly happening i went one day this week to visit the can teen out at the hospital and theirs is quite a different problem the men who come to the canteen there are mostly convalescents and there are comparatively few of them at a time so entertainment is the important thing singing and playing with them and for them the hospital is in a beautiful site on a hill just outside the city with a wonderful view in every direction being a sister to him 66 hoever conceived the idea that the best thing for the welfare of our boys in france was to get young women from the homeland into the y w c a canteens and red cross huts had a stroke of genius says dr lambert surgeon in chief of the american red cross in france in a recent interview in the new york times he believes that the army order barring out wives mothers and daughters is justified by experience but he urges a let down of the restrictions in the case of the sister clause as he believes the brother and sister relationship to be the least emotional of the relationships that exist between the sexes the sisterly state of mind the ideal state for a canteen worker who is to bring cheer to the soldier he asks also for young women and believes the twenty five year lower limit is too high to enforce these two clauses he holds is to bar the active vigorous young girls who are on a par with the active vigorous young men in our draft army the y w c a is calling for more and more of these women canteen workers a thousand are needed the y w c a

so high mind edly for all the suffragists hold dear her work had been dispatched with diplomacy and an executive ability which were remarkable it was another instance of the splendid equipment which a training in suffrage organization gives women mrs brown had made a national rec ord in the most highly specialized suffrage 0r ganization in the united states the new york suffrage party every officer present was con scious of a great pride in the oliicial representa tive of the national american voman sufo frage association to france it was evident that the collective strength of the national suf fragists had been potent with the french authorities the backing of one of the largest collective forces of womanhood in america had carried conviction to the french officials that here was something offered them of such stability that it could be counted upon it was evident between the lines of her simple presentation of facts that mrs brown’s own personality had also gone a long way in carrying conviction and this has been borne out by every letter re ceived at headquarters whether from french officials or from members of the units when writing to advertisers please mention the woman citizen your vote and the law continued from page 136 already senator kenyon has introduced a bill forbidding the transportation of the product of child labor through the united states mails and an amendment to the revenue bill has been introduced setting an adult wage as the minimum for child labor if all these fail or seem doubtful of satis fying the court there are other surer ways there is the possibility of constitutional amend ment already invoked to free the negro slave one federal law declared unconstitutional has already been made the subject of a federal amendment this is the income tax law passed in 1893 thrown out by the federal court and in 1913 made a part of the united states con stitution in amendment xvi a child labor amendment has been introduced by representative mason but the amending process is slow it holds back legislation needed by the people it would seem that if we must resort to it the best provision for the future of national social legislation would be a general common welfare amendment carrying out the purpose of the constitution as stated in its preamble namely to provide for the common welfare this would give the federal govern ment a power equivalent to the police power of the states and it would safeguard future federal laws from the supreme court senator owen has pointed out another means by which laws can be safeguarded from the court his bill re enacting the child labor law and prohibiting the supreme court from in validating it is ably defended by chief justice walter clark of north carolina f who points out that the jurisdiction conferred on the supreme court by the constitution art iii is small and then follows in all the other cases before mentioned the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact with such exceptions and under such regula tions as congress shall make the reconstruction acts were founded on the principle of senator owen’s bill which was admitted by the court itself as depriving it of power justice clark shows that the usurpation of power by the courts first appearing in the case of marbury vs madison was fought by presidents from jefferson to lincoln it has led to many unconstitutional decisions as shown by such reversals of its own decision after a term of years as the oregon ten hour case last year _he urges senator owen’s method as more speedy than a constitutional amendment but whatever special clauses in the constitu tution humane federal legislation is technically based on the real principle underlying it is the power of the united states to protect the common welfare of the nation as a whole this was expressed by justice holmes in his dissent ing opinion on the federal child labor law when he said the public policy of the united states is shaped with a view to the benefit of the nation as a whole the national welfare as under stood by congress may require a different atti tude within its sphere from that of some self seeking state it seems to me entirely consti tutional for congress to enforce its understand ing by all the means at its command ht publle june 29 1918 the woman citizen is for sale on newsstands the woman citizen

july 20 1918 w a shall tight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts for democracy for be right of those who submit to minority to have a voice in their own government afraid of women f rom east west north and south letters come pouring into ome three or four senators hold the position of boss of our office bearing the inquiry what is the infiuence their states they make and unmake governors congress sinister it must be behind the attitude of the minority in congress men and legislatures for the moment there is an all controlling which prevents them from seeing the significance of a declaration machine in their states and they are playing the part of dictator of the nation for a democracy at this time and from taking favor the vote of women would introduce a menace to the perpetuity able action on the federal amendment of that machine and such men want women to.stay at home and ask no questions about politics if their taxes are excessive it is 2 this inquiry has come from men and from women from en franchised women of many states in the west and from women all over the country anxiously impatiently indignantly waiting to learn whether this nation is really sincere in its claims that it is 58de a war 0f l’c’litical liberation several senators are not believers in democracy at all if they could have their way without injuring their own political futures if laws are not enforced and the laxity threatens the peace and dignity of their homes it is none of the women’s business theirs to pay and not to reason why one reply may be made to all these inquiries there is no more sinister influence behind the opposition of the minority than is found in the fact that each and every one of the men who hesitates to vote for the federal amendment is afraid of women they would take the ballot away from working men and give it back to a landed aristocracy they have the same distrust of the people as has the kaiser the records of many interviews letters and conversations with in the last analysis every objection leads to this conclusion o the minority will be valuable for future psychologists to study certain wct men whose campaigns have been financed by we are certain that the most expert analyst of mental operations wet interests and whose only hope 0f p0litical prefanent would arrive at no other conclusion than ours the minority of the rests in a continuation of the power of those interests are afraid senate is afmid of women the women will vote dry and thus drive them and theirs from the field the campaigns of certain other senators have been supported by manufacturers who see in women suffrage the estab lishment of child labor laws and the general improvement of women factory workers position in the matter of hours wages and standards several senators hold the opinion of women which was common a half century ago and are as unaware that times and conditions have changed as a dodo yet there are men in the majority of the senate who once held some or all of the views held by the minority they have come over to the suffrage side sometimes reluctantly hesitatingly doubtingly but often with the enthusiasm which accompanies conviction without reservation so there is not a senator in the minority who may not be modern enough to follow the example of the braver majority let no sut’fra ists des air of the re resentatives from their if it is brought to their attention that millions of women are g p p now compelled to earn their living in the field of labor and that they need the vote for their own defense they answer that these women ought not to be there and if they could have their way they would drive them back into the homes of long ago and compel brothers and brothers in law to support them while they amuse themselves with the forgotten distaff states continue to bring before them in every possible manner the righteousness the inevitability the war strategy of a stroke for democracy at this time for the nation which has set a standard in the world war and has announced that we fight for democracy c c c 146 suffrage land efore the world war began in only 18 per cent of the territory of north america were women enfranchised to any extent at present in 67 per cent of the territory of continental united states women have either full presidential municipal or primary suffrage and in 73 per cent almost three fourths of the northern half of the western continent women have a large measure of suffrage the total number of women over 21 in the united states and canada is 28,814,856 of these at the beginning of the war august 1914 about 14 per cent had the right to vote on any thing higher than school bond or tax questions now 12,935,953 or 44 per cent are in areas which have given women the right to vote on city state or national questions that is to say four years ago out of all the women of voting age north of the mexican border about one out of every seven lived in enfranchised territory now more than one out of 2 live in territory where women have been accorded a considerable degree of citizenship the total number of women of voting age in the whole of north america from the isthmus to the north pole approxi mates 33,600,000 of these no more than 11 per cent had any degree of enfranchisement beyond school bond or tax early in 1914 now 38 per cent may vote on city state or national questions to recapitulate the progress of woman suffrage in war time is to show how preeminently it has come to be considered as a war question that must be settled and settled affirmatively in war time more trouble made by women l i n der this caption the redoubtable times presents another immortal editorial as a matter of probable fact suffrage for women in new york is likely to produce more data on polit ical psychology than all the rest of the states put together have done in 1915 and 1917 women in the campaigns of new york served as watchers at the polls they did not approach their task without preparation schools for watchers were held in all parts of the city and state and all sorts of women many of those who worked during the day attended these schools in the even ings to learn thoroughly every detail of the undertaking in doing so they were obliged to learn the duties of every election officer five thousand of them served in 1915 and six thousand of them in 1917 among the number were public and private school teachers members of college faculties lawyers doctors journalists clerks bookkeepers there were few among them who were not business women and accustomed to office details and the training that the addi tional information gained through the watchers schools gave them made them expert election ofiicials very many of these women watchers assisted the officials in making out their reports the woman citizen for the reason that the officials were unable to do it correctly themselves few women watchers were there who did not emerge from their watcher’s duty with a firm conviction that very many of the political weaknesses which have led conservative men and women to condemn our whole political system have been due to the low order of mentality and training in men frequently em ployed as election ofhcials the lack of sufiicient training given before the elections by political parties and frequently sheer mental incompetence of the men so employed has led to incorrect returns n o woman who served as a watcher was there who did not realize that women serving as election officials would be giving to the state a far more valuable service than that of a mere voter therefore all over the state of new york women are asking to serve as election officials and in most counties are being gladly accepted in queens county however in which lie long island city and a portion of brooklyn both republicans and democrats are deter mined that women shall not serve in these capacities the women are insistent whereupon the times editorial declared that more the times agrees that there is little doubt of the competence of the women to perform these 7 trouble is being made by women tasks and readily arrives at the proper conclusion that one reason of opposition is that the men do not want to give up a highly valued privilege which they have monopolized so long that the thought of losing or dividing it is intensely and intolerably 9 painful to them even the times however sees danger ahead in the threat of the men to strike if any women are appointed to the new jobs created by an enlarged enrollment if the neces sity to carry it into execution should arise and if the election should go on just as well as before or better another precious domain would be lost to men forever last week the times gloried in the fact that elon brown retired senator was a reactionary and regretted his departure although his retirement is admittedly in the interests of good government now it decries the effort of women to improve the machinery of elections in queens although the item has not publicly entered into the controversy we wonder whether the seven and a half dollars per pay paid election officials has some thing to do with the stubborn opposition of republicans and democrats meanwhile suffragists congratulate themselves that all men are not like some of them c c c protecting women from their husbands 7 omen have been protected from marauding males from the contamination of politics from votes and from them selves and all of this by men who are sure they know more about what women want than any woman can possibly know what she wants for herself on this basis of male omniscience women have been immured in castles in cloistered convents and in the sacred precincts of the home with a large h they have been too good to be at large too bad to be trusted digitized by 600816 july 20 1918 too frail to be allowed out of the sight of their husbands and too dangerous to be permitted near other women’s husbands it remains for an othcial of the new york board of education to protect women from their own husbands president arthur e somers has opposed the appointment of mrs florence stevenson as an assistant teacher of sewing and cooking in the far rockaway high school on the ground that admitting married women to teaching positions in public schools may encourage men who can support their wives not to do so but to let them go forth as bread winners the number and variety of reasons moral aesthetic and eco nomic invented by the new york city board of education to prevent mar‘ried women from carrying on the profession of teacher for which they are fitted leads the casual observer to suspect that the board is governed by male prejudice and nothing less the real and the only reason for keeping married women from filling positions for which they have spent years of professional training and where they are now clamorously needed is that the men on the new york city board don't want them the excuse which has always salved men’s consciences for paying women less than men are paid has been their conviction that all men support families if it should ever become con spicuously evident that women also support families the double standard of salaries and positions would go into the discard why women want to vote his year the women of massachusetts asked their alleged representatives at springfield to protect them and their children by passing laws 1 to limit the hours of work for women and children under 18 years to 48 a week so that they would have the same protection that men in public service and on the railroads are now given 2 to restrict the night work of women and girls in subway stations for the safeguarding of their health and morals 3 to provide i0 additional inspectors for the state board of labor and industries in order that the existing labor laws for women and children might be enforced 4 to permit the minimum w'age commission to perform its work of improving wage conditions for poorly paid girls and women by allowing them to till vacancies on their own wage boards and to post wage decrees in places where women are employed and to make employers keep records of hours so that the commission can tell whether employees are receiving a living wage for a full day’s work 5 to raise the age of working children from i4 to 16 years the government is asking that children be kept in school as long as possible that they may be better prepared to serve their country 6 to provide education for all children at work that they may become better workers and better citizens 7 to grant aid to mothers with dependent children under 16 after the legislature defeated the bill for ten additional inspectors the governor sent a special message asking that the inspectors be appointed a bill was then passed providing for live temporary inspectors for one year 147 years of age so that they may be kept in school instead of being forced into the mills and factories before they have had suiiicient training to make them of real value to their country 8 to provide for a separate session of the municipal court to help in settling family difficulties so that innocent women and children may be protected from the publicity of the public sessions 9 to let women vote on the question of granting cities and towns license to sell intoxicating liquor 10 to permit women to serve on boards of health and so help in making communities clean and wholesome places in which to live ii to raise pay of state house scrub women to 30c an hour as a means of aiding them to meet the increasing cost of living a large number of bills were enacted increasing the salaries of highly paid men ofiicials from one to two thousand dollars a year the massachusetts legislature made up of men elected by men raters refused to pass any of these protective laws in memoriam t a meeting of the board of directors of the national 4 american woman sufrage association held july 10th 1918 the following resolution of regret was unanimously passed resolved that the board of directors of the national ameri can woman sufrage association express deep regret at the john parrov michel and profound gratitude for the fearless assistance he rendered to the cause of woman sufrage and for the memorable example of citizenship he has given to our nation with the eyes of man c‘it is not a man’s fault that in viewing what is called woman’s sphere he sees with the eyes of a man for god and nature created him masculine and god and nature appear to have made the soul of each sex a riddle to the other loss of never to be accurately read and never to be understood and as i should not like to live in a world where men’s lives were governed by the misunderstanding will of women i concede that women are justified in protesting against being compelled to live in a world where misunderstanding men dictate to women respect ing things that are women’s the fact that men are prevented by natural constitution from seeing very far into the soul of women should make them hesitant to retain and to exercise the power to regulate the collective lives of women god and nature have withheld from men clear vision into the soul of women but men should acknowledge that their creator has endowed men with reason and with the ability to be just and reason deduces the justice of heeding what women collectively say regarding what should and should not be in woman’s sphere the radiator uffrage is coming just as surely as victory is coming for the allies as president wiison so clearly states the question is bound up with world democracy and if the united states is to maintain its position as the leader in world democracy it must have universal suffrag jackson imiss news digitized by 148 the woman citizen south dakota’s citizenship measure 66 e look to you to wage the finest campaign south dakota has ever had it is a fight in the cause of patriotism and there must be no stone left unturned that will bring victory to the polls no vember 5 this is practically what the leg islators of south da kota told the women of that state when the just ly famous amendment e was passed in the special session of the legislature of that state in 1918 amendment e is unique in that it makes citizenship the basis of participation in govern mental affairs without the knowledge of the suffragists of south da kota the legislature framed the amendment to the woman suffrage amendment which makes it a citizenship bill totally disregarding that time honored phrase without regard to sex south dakota is too much abreast of the spirit of the times to make anything but citizenship the basis of the right of suffrage when mrs john l pyle president of the universal fran chise league and the other women of that body were told of the action of the legislature they offered to forego the proposed campaign for the suffrage amendment in order to devote their energies solely to war service sure that south dakota men would never let a citizenship measure go down to defeat but legislators and other men interested in the measure urged the women to proceed with their campaign holding it to be part of the patriotic work that confronted the loyal women of the state outh dakota is a first paper state under its present laws which means that there are many men in that state enjoying the full privileges of citizenship and in some cases holding office though they have only declared intention of becoming citizens no longer con tent to let this remain south dakota's men and women are using every efiort to make cit izenship the requirement for full participation in governmental affairs how south dakota came to hit upon the happy union of the suffrage and citizenship clauses in one amendment is explained by mrs frank i shuler corresponding secretary of the national american woman suffrage asso ciation who as the chairman of campaigns and surveys for the national body was recently in south dakota a special session of the south dakota leg islature convening in 1918 to enact war emer gency measures faced the necessity of correcting the state’s lax election law which permits men to vote before they swear allegiance to the united states the legislature in regular ses sion in 1917 had passed a woman suffrage amendment these bills both pertained to the qualifications of voters and therefore had to be amendments to article 7 of the constitution which defined them it has been suggested that the sufi‘rage the faculty of south dakota’s suffrage school amendment and the amendment taking the franchise from aliens not naturalized should have been submitted as separate propositions and not included in one amendment this seems reasonable but was in fact impossible with one amendment to article 7 already submitted any proposed amendment to that amendment had to be germane to it if two separate amendments had been submitted the first would have defined electors as men and women with the necessary qualifications as to age and resi dence who are either citizens or had declared their intention to become such the other would have defined as electors men who were citizens either native born or naturalized if one of the amendments had carried and the other had failed the intention of the voters would of course have been plain and the effect of the amendment easy to determine but if both had carried there would then have been two definitions as to who should be an elector each as conclusive as the other upon the question 5 4 involved and the two so inconsistent that each would destroy the effect of the other it will thus readily be seen that the amendment to elimi nate the word male which had been passed by the regular session of the legislature could not be amended by one which would pertain only to males there fore in order to submit the anti alien measure it was necessary to in corporate it in the al ready submitted woman s u f f r a g e amendment the amendment to the amendment was there fore passed a n d is k n o w n as amend ment e mrs shuler is enthusiastic over amendment e it is a patriotic amendment it gives the ballot to american citizens and denies it to the alien who does not intend to become an ameri can two reasons for its passage stand out first war involves both men and women and women as a necessary industrial force in government should be invested with the full rights of citizenship second enemy aliens are not willing to fight for us and therefore they should not be entrusted to vote for us it was found in south dakota during the draft that many men who should be a part of the draft could not be in ducted into the national army because they had only declared intention to become citizens yet they had been enjoying rights and privileges denied the loyal american women of that state 6 6 0 pass amendment e will benefit the women who are sacrificing so much in this world struggle it will bring to the immi grant a realization of the value of citizenship and the friendly alien will be willing to wait for the ballot until he has passed the probation pe riod to pass such an amendment with citizenship as its basis will show the enemy alien that america has no place for the man who would make financial profit out of the country which he has adopted while cherishing the ideals of a despotic and militaristic government i believe that the men of south dakota will realize they can best safeguard their homes by giving the ballot to the women of the state who are whole heartedly with their country in its aims and pur poses and by taking political privilege from men who still admit their loyalty to the kaiser governor n orbeck is well known as a cham pion of the woman suffrage cause and poli ticians and press stand with him in the cam paign to make south dakota’s electorate 100 per cent american but to make assurance of support doubly sure the republican and demo cratic parties of the state at their respective conventions on july 2 came out unequivocally for suffrage for the women of that state and of the nation it was a glorious day in south dakota's suffrage annals continued on page 158 july 20 1918 149 parties and primaries ehin d the official government by consti tutional authorities there exists in the united states as in practically all civilized coun tries what might be called an unofficial gottern ment by parties the constitution gives the government its form the parties give it its life so thoroughly is party control recognized as the life of government that the word politics the greek word for government itself is used to describe it a political party is defined by professor macy as an agency for co ordinating and expressing the general will of the subjects of a large and populous state by ray it is described more concretely as a durable organization of indi viduals or groups of individuals fluctuating in personnel and numbers united by common prin ciples or a common policy the political party educates and organizes public opinion by discussion of public questions it does through group action for the voter what he cannot do alone it crystalizes the public opinion it creates or represents in a platform a series of planks or formally expressed de mands on government only by controlling the government through holding its offices can the party carry out its platforms therefore it se lects candidates for office and organizes and hnances campaigns for their election this actual control of government by the party system in order to carry out live social objects has in the words of ray breathed the breath of life into the inert governmental organ ism through politics government grows and changes with the changing social needs of the governed the party system is as old as the government of the united states under various names the history of the republican and democratic par ties is co extensive with the history of the united states parties are national in origin not state but class lines form their limits ince the struggle at the constitutional con vention between the federalism of hamil ton and the democracy of jefferson 3 funda mental governmental issue between parties has been the scope of the federal government around this question the two major parties were built up this is the first plank in their platform the federalists who may be roughly identified with the later republicans believed in a strong national government based upon liberal interpretation of the constitution the democrats in a strictly circumscribed federal government based upon literal interpretation of the constitution r the people vs the favored classes democracy in its general sense has been another govern mental issue between democrats and republi cans this issue unlike states rights has not been left to the two major parties most minor parties have made of the people their whole plat form the planks being all of a nature to in crease the people’s power true some have in terpreted the people to be the agricultural classes only one sixth of our population others have interpreted them to be the wage earners about two fifths of our population but few have represented privilege vs the common people of strictly governmental planks which in these minor platforms have aimed to increase the people's power are those looking toward direct introduction to political parties part one by mary sumner boyd democracy such as the initiative referendum and recall since the life of a nation is dependent on the livelihood of its people it is not surprising that the two great parties soon added an economic issue indeed it may be said that states rights vs federalism had opposing economic bases in slavery vs commerce the purely economic question on which the great parties differed was the tariff or tax on imported commodities the republicans stood and stand now for a high enough tariff to enable the nation to develop its own infant industries and become self suffi cient the democrats oppose this protective tariff looking at the matter from the consum ers not the manufacturers point of view they advocate such an interchange of commodities between countries as will keep prices low and only sufficient tariff to furnish an income to the government tariff for revenue only is their cry it must be said however that for various reasons too complex to explain here in practice the democratic revenue tariff has to day much the same effect on the consumer’s pocketbook as has the republican protective tariff short of adopting the british principle of free trade it is difficult to draw tariff lines closely bound up with the tariff is the eco nomic question of the trusts or monopolies the democrats would prevent trusts the republi cans at first took no action against them but later adopted a policy of regulation this later policy was adopted at least in part in response to criticism by the democrats and the minor parties while the party educates the public the public on its side educates the party so that old party issues are pushed into the background in favor of new the public opinion which most effectively educates a party is that which is organized and expressed in the platforms of opposition parties the major par ties in power are continually seeking to defend their records and to commend themselves to the parties and primaries parts one and two in this issue and that of july 27 will be followed by a series of articles on the various political parties telling why each has the best of all pos sible platforms in the august numbers of the woman citizen reasons for voting the democratic re publican prohibition

united states were the agrarian par ties of the middle west the populists green backers free silverites of the last generation the present farmers party is the farmers non partisan league founded in north dakota in 1915 which has now organized in many middle western states and has recently entered new york among its demands are publicly owned flour mills elevators packing and storage plants government control of transportation prohibi tion and woman suffrage labor has been rep resented in politics by several parties but the most vigorous expression of its demands is the platform of the present socialist party n the presidential campaign of 1912 the pro i gressive party polled over four million votes at the last presidential election this party was amalgamated with the republican party from its platform many planks of which it shared with one or another of the other minor parties the republican and democratic platforms have borrowed many suggestions a party which can in a sense be called successor to the progressive party is the national party formed in the spring of 1917 which also owes a debt to the socialist party for its platform the prohibition party stands fifth in the vote it polls the organization of political parties in amer ica is professor dealey tells us the best type of political organization in the world at the top is an executive body called the national com mittee as a presidential election approaches this body calls a convention made up of dele gates from each state this convention nomi nates the presidential candidate draws up a plat form and appoints a new national committee to carry on the presidential campaign another committee carries on congressional campaigns every two years the state is organized like the nation only whereas the two national commit tees are intermittent bodies the state central committee made up usually of one delegate from each county is permanent keeping the party business going all the time for local business and local elections there are county committees made up generally of one delegate from each town and city committee and city committees of one from each precinct or election district some county committees are large the new york county committee has many hundred members thus the general lines of political organiza tion are the lines of national state and local government in the control of the party com mittees is a perfect machine organized in such detail that in every precinct each of the two to four hundred voters is reached during a cam paign and every party vote brought out a party is in control and can push its policies when it holds a majority in a legislature this gives it the chairmanship and a majority on all committees which consider bills introduced it gives it also the speakership of the house for the speaker is elected by majority vote he has large control over legislation for he has power to give the floor to members in debate to refer bills and to make committee appointments digitized by gofjirtygiéw 158 150 r___ ____ 0 ne of the needs of the new war boom city the municipality created by the munition making or ship building plant is proper housing and one of the people who has helped solve such a problem in war in flated bridgeport connecticut is miss marcia mead of the firm of schenck and mead 105 n'est fortieth street manhattan she was the first woman graduate of the school of architecture in columbia univer sity and has specialized on community housing and town planning some of this particularized training found expression in community homes on the outskirts of a staid old colonial ameri can city which has suddenly acquired all the features of a western boom town the same phenomenal growth is turning birmingham alabama into an upreaching town of skyscrapers ship building operations are writing new housing needs all over the country things are happening in these war boom towns just now and one would like to know how these happenings are being met and espe cially how far sighted women are planning to overcome difficulties war towns present a spectacular movement differing from anything the world has ever seen a rush of prosperous work with intol erable accompaniments the speeding up incident to munition mak ing has necessitated other speeding up allied industries are going full steam ahead prices of rents and provisions have taken on the wings of the aeroplane the prices here in bridgeport are some thing fierce a young connecticut laborer is quoted as saying although he had only him self and his young wife to support he found that the 20 which should have lasted a week lasted four days now there’s only 2.10 left he ended dolefully and the young husband was only one of many plaintiffs in the affair of bridgeport prices new york has nothing on us for high th e general court the war boom city housmg 1n bridgeport prices said a woman who kept account of the high cost of discomfort in connecticut and compared it with the metropolitan expenses of her brother in a careful survey women as munitiou workers miss amy hewes tells something about what happened in the war boom town of bridgeport when the rush of munition making struck it for what happened in bridgeport was as unexpected as what happened in belgium bridgeport was as badly stificd under the financial depression of 1914 as any other but its american city more so than many m i m l 2 km i t i we a ll cit l j i‘m i 4m h this in to every house its own street door the woman citizen schenck and head architects population of a little more than 100,000 be gan to speed up in the fall of 1915 and by the time the 1916 directory was prepared the city’s population had increased 37 per cent over that of 1910 millions of dollars were expended in erect ing new munition factories and the contagion of prosperity struck the city when prosperity corries in at the factory rents go up in the household this is just as axiomatic as its prototype about love and pov erty the factory owner profits the landlord profits the merchant profits but the house holder is always about two jumps behind his rent schedule for what he gets in advanced wages must go not only to the landlord but to the merchant and the railroad and the water company and the gas corporation each one of whom has raised the cost of its own com modity thus it happens that in bridgeport with work at high speed and wage scales rising there has been much discomfort and even mis ery because of the general unpreparedness of such a city for the increase in inhabitants the trolley service adequate for 100,000 be came a daily misery to the 140,000 people de pendent upon it innumerable honking jitncys jacked up the insufficient transportation them selves insuliicient the foreign money order business in the overcrowded local post office showed an increase on july 31 1916 of 88 per cent over the record of the year ending july 31 1915 money became active people mortgaged their homes to take advantage of new business opportunities rents leaped as houses became scarce and in the scale of their rising there was discomfort for the many and tragedy for the unfortunates a woman with six chil dren and a sick husband reported rent raised monthly from 17 to 18 to 19 and two months later to 24 when a new raise was threatened she complained to the city authorities another landlord had a crescendo of prices in seven months from 16 to 20 in a house where three large families lived with july 20 1918 out bath or wash tubs and with one toilet for all speculators bought up houses where rents had been 12 and 14 and put them at once up to 18 one young married couple with an income of 18 is a case cited in miss hewes’s survey they could not find a flat within their income and perched uncomfortably in one room with the furniture they had bought for their new home stacked about them small cold cottages at the nearby summer beaches became a final resort for many extra stoves were set up in fiimsy cottages meant for the torrid zone weather of an american sum mer and the frequent snow and ice the lack of proper sanitary and heating arrange ments and the long car ride to their work were not the only drawbacks to healthful home life the usual cheap summer amusement places still flourished and exercised distinctly unde sirable influences old residents suffered from the sudden oust ing because of rents incoming workers were almost in worse plight like noah’s dove they could not find a place to alight the multiple dwelling began to make itself seen in the town which had been one of indi vidual homes on much bepraised tree lined streets the laws for overcrowding were strained to the breaking point many families averaging more than one and one half per sons to a room each month it became less possible to pare down other items to pay the high rents there was less meat less bread less milk clearly something had to be done in bridge port the civic spirit of the community con science was stirring 6 6 ven while the city seemed to be asleep says miss amy hewes new ideas were fermenting bridgeport had ceased to be a typ ical american industrial city and had become a unique american civic community it was this new bridgeport questing for an adequate remedy for its problems that found miss marcia mead architect and gave her a chance to work out some plans from a wom an's point of view the bridgeport housing company a group of individuals some of them manufacturers some public spirited souls who happened incidentally to be on the chamber of commerce started on a laboratory method of working out the housing problem no one was sure whether the multiple dwell ing community housing or the detached small home would work into the swiftest alleviation so this adventurous group determined to ex periment with all three and await results it was a genuine scientific research which was undertaken an adventuring into hot water cen tral heating among other things the housing company put up capital like good sports for a a much needed war measure if you have an idea about how to house people in decent comfort with a fair return on the money in vested go to it they said in effect to miss mead eventually they put 1,000,000 in the project and the government is now backing a vastly larger scheme to house 6,000 people miss mead’s immediate problem in the corn necticut avenue development was community housing a matter in which she has worked out theories of her own this plan covering a small tract of land included eighty seven row houses of single and two family type taking care of 139 families in apartments ranging from miss marcia mead an architect who specializes on the housewife’s need and has just been elected to the american institute of architects two rooms and bath to five rooms and bath they were built at an estimated average of 2,603 per family for building and 449 for land and development together with streets play grounds garden patch the development occu pies approximately one city block and is so laid out that there is a central playground an open plaza for gatherings of adults garden and clothes drying space and intersecting roads and walks for delivery purposes about 60 per cent of the total development has been equipped with circulating hot water system supplied from an adjoining power house in connection with this group there are two stores one at least will be run on a co operative basis and will handle all food prod ucts which can be distributed through co operative buying the housing company’s ideal is to make housekeeping easy and rents as low as possible re.nts range from 15 to 29 for the apartments heated individually by hot air furnaces for the portion heated by the central hot water system a variable charge will be made on the basis of the number of rooms a maximum monthly charge in winter a mini mum charge in summer and an intermediate charge in spring and fall the company will supply a gardener and repair man that is if there are gardeners and repair men extant in these manless united states at present every house is rented and payments in excess of rent may be applied towards owner ship vvhen any tenant shall have paid in 10 per cent with interest of the cost of any sep arate house over and above his rent the com pany will sell the house to this tenant on the instalment plan this is especially designed so that newly married young people can begin saving and still live decently one part of the plan which shows a woman’s touch is the placing of the children’s play ground in the center of the block away from all automobiles and easily guarded from the kitchen windows of the houses this means an oversight of the children at play by mothers at their housework 151 nother feminine detail is the eeect of a privacy and individuality each tenant has his individual entrance front and back indi vidual porch and yard with lighting and ven tilation the houses are in the main rented to skilled workmen clerks and office workers the scheme has been worked out on a mildly re munerative basis returning 6 per cent on the money invested by the housing company it was not intended as a speculative venture but these are not the only feminine notes miss mead succeeded in interpolating into the connecticut development when homes are being built says miss mead the housewife should be consulted for the work of taking care of the home falls to her lot and it is astonishing to what a degree the plan of the house lightens or complicates her burdens the architect should know all about her particular system of work the placing of stove and sink and table and cupboard and then there is the question of light of cross ventilation wall spacing for furniture beloved of the home maker windows now they are a tender pas sion with miss mead she says she was even obliged to curb her ardor for windows to fit city ordinances there are no rooms in miss mead’s house without cross ventilation he woman’s point of view as worked out by miss mead has made its impression even upon the federal endowed scheme of housing woman’s long remonstrance against sinks and tubs set'too low found a voice at last and plans accepted by the new and larger adminis tration housing scheme will show higher sinks and wash tubs miss mead says that she had no trouble in convincing working men of the need for changing the sinks after she had taken the pains and trouble to demonstrate her point for that is what she cunningly and skilfully put through a ventilation of the defects of the kitchen arrangements for women which have been standardized by masculine architects mas culine carpenters masculine plumbers she had two sets of tubs and sinks arranged one at standard level one at her specified level she showed the assembled workmen who stood around in an interested semicircle that in order to use the low type even short women must bend forward at the waist putting a tiresome strain on muscles at the small of the back she let them try for themselves and see just how exhausting it would be to bend down to a low washtub then she demonstrated the hygienic advantage of the high sinks and tubs proving that the use of shoulder and arm mus cles brought into play when the body is erect really makes for good health while the stoop ing position brings about bodily disorder the only real contest over these changes of levels in working surfaces came not from workmen but from managers who wanted to install low sinks because they were of standard make because nobody had to go through an arduous process of thinking to adhere to an established custom and just natuarlly because plumbers never had set sinks any other way why are women messing in the business of plumbers and architects anyway however there they are higher sinks and tubs in the community housing plan for 139 families achieved by miss mead’s own firm and assured for 6,000 other people 152 the woman citizen in memory of two suffragists n the passing of miss mary curry desha breckinridge the world has lost a true sol dier of the kingdom of light in the simple service held for her at the nurses home of the presbyterian hospital in chicago jane addams well described her as a pioneer woman a pioneer missionary of social service born of a famous old kentucky family a sister of miss sophonisota breckinridge she early showed her quality while scarcely more than a child with no encouragement from her family she took a kindergarten course because her people would not consent to her training for a nurse she became one of the first kinder garten teachers of lexington ky and also started a night school where she and other volunteers taught poor boys in the spanish war she longed inexpressibly to go into the hospitals but again deferred to the objections of her family soon after how ever she took a nurse’s training first in new york later at the presbyterian hospital in chi cago she then went to the insane hospital at elgin 111 where the first advance was made in giving to those mentally ill the same skilled nursing as is given to physical illness she was the first trained nurse in the united states to undertake the care of the insane after her service at elgin she gave herself for five years to discovering and caring for persons suffering from tuberculosis in the poor est and most crowded parts of chicago then she made a survey of the rural districts in michigan the first undertaken in this country following the lead of canada and for two years she set an example on which like surveys in other states have been modeled at the time of the dayton flood she was one of the first to the rescue arriving even before the flood had gone down and facing hardship and danger he was one of the first to answer the call of france for nurses she went out with the unit from chicago in may 1915 served at a base hospital just behind the firing line as long as the unit stayed and then joined the ameri can ambulance at neuilly sur seine after the united states entered the war she went to the red cross hospital in paris and toiled there happy in her work when she heard that she might be of help in organizing the barrow unit for that sole purpose she hurried home there was a delay in the organization of the unit and she started to take a course in anaesthesia at the lakeside hospital in cleveland so as to be of more service on her return to france but she contracted grippe and her years of hardship and overwork had made her unable to throw it off her brother desha breckin ridge writes in the lexington herald something of her spirit may be gleaned from one incident sitting at her bedside the cry was forced from my lips it’s a bitter price to pay curry her spirit dashed to her eyes and drove all semblance of pain away her tired face broke into a smile and she said no desha no price is too high to pay to have helped as many as i have helped in f rance it was not a long life not long enough for her ever to have done a selfish or a cowardly thing ever to have told an untruth ever to by alice stone blackwell have failed to respond to an appeal for help but into it was crowded as much of service as we believe it possible to be crowded into so few years the memorial resolutions passed by the gradtrate nurses of lexington said in part her best years were spent in doing good in battling against the dominion of human suf fering in behalf of the weak and the poor and the undefended generous of her service even unto prodigality cheerful helpful just in spired with enthusiasm for all that was cour ageous and clean minded friendly _candid modest uncompromising with wrong regard ing wealth as dross and public preferment as unworthy unless embellished by sincerity and sacrifice her passing brings a loss to us we cannot measure but in that passing leaves an example that will abide the lucy stone centennial ugust 13 1918 will be the one hundredth anniversary of lucy stone’s birth the day is always'celebrated by various local suf frage clubs in different parts of the country and sometimes a number of new england suf fragists gather from different towns and villages to hold a special celebration at the farm house near west brookfield massachusetts where lucy stone was born friends who may have it in view to make a pilgrimage to the place this year are asked by the family not to do so as particular circumstances make it inconvenient very near that date the stork is expected to arrive at the old farm house bringing a little great grand niece or great grand nephew of lucy stone but many suffrage clubs will no doubt celebrate in their own localities the one hundredth birthday of the woman who did so much valiant pioneer work for the cause in the dark and difficult early days in the hearts of those who knew her the memory of her cour age and sweetness will nev‘br die and to thou sands of younger women the story of her life has been an inspiration those who cannot get together for a celebra tion should celebrate individually by doing some bit of good suffrage work that is what would please her best send a contribution to the suffrage treasury or write to your representa tive in the legislature urging the ratification of the federal suffrage amendment or write a letter advocating equal suffrage to your local paper or persuade a friend to subscribe for the woman citizen to day the cause for which lucy stone worked so long and so unselfishly is touching its triumph let us hope that she and the other pioneers know it and are glad object to guardianship 66 he faith of liberalism is that in the long run self government is the best government millions of private persons would lead more prosperous lives if they were under wise care but that is no argument for putting half the human race under the guardianship of people who claim to know what is g00d for them doesn’t it sound as if the man who said that were making a speech for woman suffrage but he was not he was talking in behalf of home rule for ireland the world moves on he fall of the bastile has been celebrated this year by all the allied powers they do well to celebrate it yet when that event took place it was a portent of dismay to almost every established government in europe it typified the overthrowing of the old order under which the people had suffered for so many centuries without redress it was the picturesque and dramatic announcement that submission was henceforth to be exchanged for active resis tance the resistance widened and grew it was accomplished by all sorts of excesses excesses that were the greater because of the greatness of the oppression that had gone before liberty was baptized with blood and in every monarch ial country those who hated and feared liberty cried out against the bloodshed while at the bottom of their hearts it was not the abuses of freedom that they feared so much as freedom itself their nerves had stood without a shudder all the bloodshed and cruelty that had been committed to keep the people down for generations the name of the french revo lution was anathema to all the reactionaries in all the monarchies of the world even in the united states up to a few years ago the anti suffragists used to declare as a taunt that the suffrage movement in america was the daughter of the french revolution although margaret brent and abigail adams had taken their stand for freedom before the bastile fell to play the marseillaise was considered hardly respec table now it is played as freely and enthusias tically as the star spangled banner the world now realizes that the great thing was the birth of liberty and that the excesses accom panying it were of small moment in comparison even the anti suffragists see it now if they happen to live in an allied country it is well that they see it at last a few years hence they may also see the inconsistency of their present attitude they rejoice in the fall of the bastile though it was followed by the reign of terror but they object to woman suf frage because some unwise women once picketed the white house they glory in the french revolution although most of the men who took part in it were atheists yet they urge as a serious objection to equal suffrage that mrs stanton wrote the woman’s bible all movements for human freedom are spirit ually akin and clear sighted people can per ceive the relationship without having to wait to get a long historical perspective they can also distinguish the kernel from the husk the right eous principle from all the excesses and vagaries that accompany the assertion of it the true friends of freedom have long rejoiced in the french revolution and thrilled to the strains of the marseillaise now even the eyes of the blind are being opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped digitized by 600816 july 20 1918 mrs samuel castleman

of the convention's reason for be ing the present is woman’s golden opportunity for advancement in the business world the entrance of women into the industrial world is of sufficient importance to engage the attention of the war department which recently an thorized a statement that equal pay for equal work done by women filling the places of men in war industries would be the policy of the army ordnance department this affords the most wonderful opportunity for women to dem onstrate their real ability to work shoulder to shoulder with men and they are doing it successfully he tone of

assistant librarian or the newark public library a 156 the woman citizen the federal suffrage amendment one more reason year ago the question of an amendment a to the state constitution extending suf f rage to women in massachusetts was presented to the constitutional convention then in ses sion the amendment was referred to a com mittee for recommendation after due con sideration this committee voted 9 to 6 to pre sent'an adverse report so much business filled the days of the convention that the body ad journed and the report of l the committee was placed on the order of business for the next session in june of this year shortly after the convention had reassembled the adverse report of the committee was accepted the minority members of the committee were ready to carry the fight to the fioor of the convention last year and were prepared to do the same this summer but with the federal amendment pend ing it was deemed wiser by those who were working for the resolve in the convention to make no fight at this time mrs charles sumner bird the newly elected first vice president and chairman of the execu tive board of the massachusetts woman suf frage association commented upon this it is rather unusual perhaps to rejoice in the defeat of any suffrage measure but it cer tainly would have been disastrous at this time when we are daily expecting news of the pass age of the susan b anthony amendment by the united states senate to have to supplement a campaign for ratification by our state legis lature of the federal amendment with an at tempt to win on a referendum an amendment to the massachusetts constitution a year ago when we asked the constitu tional convention to present the amendment to the constitution of massachusetts we did not realize that congress would act so quickly and we were anxious to leave no stone unturned which would help toward equal franchise to day we are waiting for the opportunity to ask our state legislature to ratify the action of congress and place massachusetts among the first in this progressivemovement as we are proud to feel she always stands in all forward action for health’s sake esolutions favoring adoption of the federal suffrage the national prohibi tion amendment and equal pay for women workers were adopted yesterday by the vomen’s bureau of public health of the american osteopathic association which re cently held its annual convention in boston the resolutions in part follow whereas our country suffers a shortage of labor through the enlistment of men in the army and whereas in time of war it is especially neces sary to provide for child welfare therefore be it resolved that we discourage the mothers of young children from entering fields of in dustry and encourage public support of such needy mothers and that we lend our every ef fort to maintain the enforcement of all child labor laws until all adult labor both men and women is exhausted whereas our women are being drafted to fill the ranks left vacant by men who have gone so valiantly to fight and whereas they are daily proving that they can as satisfactorily and as efficiently fill these positions therefore be it resolved that we advocate the payment of the same wage for the performance of the same work in order that our working women may find this world a decent place in which to live and rear the future generations without the sacrifice of health whereas in the past wars have been fought upon the undeniable postulate that where all are created free and equal taxation without repre sentation is unjust and untenable therefore be it resolved that we earnestly support the bill now before congress to submit the federal suffrage amendment to the several state legis latures that democracy may begin at home texas’s women voters n one town in texas amarillo there will be more women than men voting at the demo cratic primaries on july 27 a total of 2,112 women as against 2,072 men registered in palestine also more women than men registered it will be remembered that one reason why texas women urgently appealed for the vote now during the war is that so many texas men have gone to the front and while the state does not permit its soldiers to vote even when in camp in texas it does permit aliens not fully natural ized to vote loyal texas women declare that wives and mothers of men fighting for their country would make a better electorate than men who had not been in this country long enough to have taken out their naturalization papers three hundred and sixty thousand texas women in all registered at the primaries suc cessfully negotiating six confusing rulings from the attorney general’s ofiice a strong plank he republican party of iowa wrote a strong federal amendment plank into its platform at their annual convention at des moines july 10 the republicans determined to put iowa in the vanguard of states that will ratify the amendment at the 1919 legislative ses sions the plank reads the republican party of iowa reaffirms its declaration for equal suffrage it urges the immediate passage of the federal amendment by the united states senate and its ratification by the state and commends our senators and rep resentatives in congress for their support of this amendment the suffrage cause was presented to the res olutions committee by miss anna b lawther president of the iowa equal suffrage associa tion who made a brief speech in its behalf others of the suffrage committee appearing be fore the resolutions committee were mrs james a devitt vice president of the state suffrage association mrs frank dodson re cording secretary of the state association and mrs henry spaulding a former executive offi cer of the association he federal suffrage amendment was given unanimous endorsement by the demo cratic state central committee of arkansas on july 9th the following day the democrats in state convention endorsed the federal amend ment and wrote a full suffrage plank in the party platform mrs t t cotnam chairman of the arkansas equal suffrage central committee was a member of the resolutions committee at the democratic convention miss josephine miller a member of the staff of organizers of the national american woman suffrage asso ciation was on the platform committee esolutions of protest against the delay in the passage of the federal amendment by the senate were passed by the progress club of oelwein iowa on july 9 about 150 women being present an address on suffrage was made by miss anna b lawther president of the iowa equal suffrage association words of wisdom he federal amendment for woman suerage has gone through the lower house of congress by more than a two thirds vote and the expectation is that it will secure the needed two thirds in the senate the minority who are still opposing it would do well to ponder the words spoken by henry b blackwell at a legislative hearing in massachusetts on january 18 1894 in behalf of a pending bill for munici pal woman suffrage after making an argument along the usual ethical lines on the ground of justice mr blackwell said to the legislators in conclusion i appeal to you for a moment as members of political parties we are all party men we ought to be if we believe in the principles of our party now both parties to day are on trial much more than woman suf f rage is on trial the political result of woman suffrage when it comes will largely depend upon the political complexion of the vote by which the legislature confers it if an equal proportion of democrats and republicans ex tend suffrage to women as they ought to do for it ought to be the unanimous vote of both parties then this question would have no par ticular party sigificance both parties would gain by it for both parties would be uplifted the spirit of both would be changed by the in troduction of the intelligent womanhood of these parties but let this great act of justice be done by the republicans or let it be done by the democrats the other party opposing and the party that does the act of justice will de serve to receive and will receive an immense accession of strength through its action some of you are republicans some of you are demo crats but whichever you be you owe it to your party because you believe that the success of your party is the success of good government to see that you get enough men of your party to vote for it to prevent its having any political significance against you i these words are as true today as when they were uttered then only a chosen few saw their truth now it is seen by all the men in congress except a small and stubborn minor itv a s b digitized byicoosic july 20 1918 correspondence concerning cottonseed flour_ to the editor or the woman citizen i just read mr charles duryea’s request for information concerning cottonseed flour i have used cottonseed flour with very good result and will gladly pass on my knowl edge for the benefit of the readers cottonseed flour or allison flour as the product is known commercially after its in ventor is manufactured by the schulenburg oil mill schulenburg texas it has about 50 per cent protein and 15 per cent fat and is highly recommended by dieticians on ac count of easy assimilation and reconstructive elements the best results in bread making are ob tained if 20 to 30 per cent allison flour is mixed with wheat corn or any other kind of flour used for bread the same proportion should be used in biscuits and muffins for griddle cakes equal parts of allison flour wheat flour and corn meal will give excellent results wherever it is used it gives a rich nutty flavor and a golden brown color the state of texas has issued two pamphlets no 128 and no 163 entirely devoted to the subject of cottonseed flour and copies can be obtained by writing the texas experiment sta tion college station texas lydia aspegren portsmouth va how congress functions to the editor or the woman citizen our comment in the last issue of the woman citizen that the cooperation of the wilful few republicans and the wilful few democrats to delay suffrage was an amazing sight to the galleries would seem to indicate that those amazed are not close stu dents of how congress functions or fails to function as has been pointed out by the na tional voters league the battles at washing ton between republicans and democrats are mostly sham battles for the benefit of the regular party voter when it comes to a water power grab or a mineral land grab or the defense of special privilege or anything really important the tories in congress whatever their party label pull together just as they did on june 27 may i suggest that every reader of the lvoman citizen who is a voter and every other reader who will soon be a voter and that means all the rest would do well to subscribe to the searchlight on congress published by the national voters league woodward build ing washington d c the ordinary newspa per suppresses much that is significant and colors what news it does print to suit the preju dices and interests of its owners it utterly fails to provide the necessary data for an in telligent appraisal of the men in congress and their value to the nation i know of no other source of concentrated honest public spirited information as to congress which can compare with the national voters league i suspect that some of the editors of the woman citizen are on its mailing list i hope they will bring the national voters league to the favorable attention of their readers yours very truly waban mass charles h porter that zone system t 0 the editor of the woman citizen i may i say in your columns how glad i am that representative blanton in his reply to me admits the sectionalism in the pro posed system of postal rates and has no other defense than the school boy’s but jimmy he does it too however it is a far cry from sectionalism in fruit to sectionalism in thought unfort unate as it is that the people of one state are denied the fruits of distant states that is a disadvantage unworthy of mention in the same paragraph with a sectionalism that keeps each of the two states from knowing what the other is thinking the representative is materialistic and that too at a time when the whole world is strug gling to get its feet on higher ground what do we gain though we conquer mittel europa if we sink to her level of materialism in the effort he is asking too great a sacrifice for he is asking us to surrender the very secret of our superior culture i v i am pleased also

california in boston especially to the editor of the woman citizen n your issue of june 8 1918 you publish a i letter from ursula clark boston mass and i desire to say that this letter must surely be a joke as there should not be one woman in this whole united states of ours who is so far behind the times and so unenlightened especially in boston as to write a letter of this character the lady asks that you discontinue your paper but i feel sure that the women of amer ica would immediately send up such a wail of protest that it would be heard throughout the land and even penetrate to boston

from fifteen to eighteen years texas women didn’t have to beseech the men knew that they might as well pass it after they had given women the ballot so they did it it has been twenty to twenty five years since it was raised from twelve years to fifteen years in texas i well remember how hard the w c t u of texas worked to get it done and how the president mrs helen m stoddard stayed in austin almost the entire session in the interest of that bill and how the different unions assessed themselves to pay her expenses all the texas candidates from constable up tell us they are suhragists it’s

opportunity to learn all about amendment e a suffrage map showing the gradations of suffrage in the united states was depicted by young women marchers in the sioux falls patriotic parade and this was followed by a float of the various nations that have enfran chised their women in their midst stood miss columbia asking the same old riddle why do not all women in this democracy have the right of franchise other floats showed why mothers should have the vote banners bearing quotations from president wilson and the suf frage planks in the political platform were borne with much pride suffrage headquarters were opened in sioux falls on the fourth and windows were made gay with suffrage banners and suffrage slogans the climax of suffrage fourth of july ac tivities was scheduled for ruskin

distribute literature were on hand but the big passenger car was in capacitated and unable to make the flight a smaller plane beautifully decorated made a flight with suffrage pennants and streamers fly ing in the breeze above 25,000 persons gath ered on the grounds in the evening mrs mcmahon spoke from the grand stand when mrs pyle and mrs mcmahon wrote the ruskin park management for permission to distribute literature from the aeroplane sentor r e dowdell one of the owners of the park replied saying the inventive ingenuity of man has not as yet devised a means af ascension suffi cient to carry the cause of equality to the pin nacle on which it should be enthroned but the management gladly yields to you the aeroplane for so worthy a purpose another phase of suffrage activity out of which big results may be expected is the suf frage schools which were held in seven of the principal towns of south dakota natertown aberdeen huron pierre deadwood mitchell and sioux falls with trips to nearby towns where meetings were held and addresses made in all seventeen towns and cities were covered in the fourteen days with loyalty banquets and conferences to fill in spare moments the

florida the legislature was solidly so twenty hve had a republican majority in three one house was republican and one democratic and one minnesota was non partisan this analysis shows how not only in national but in state affairs the two great parties hold between them today almost absolute sway the minor parties serving merely like a greek chorus to criticise and admonish but control of the legislature is not complete control a chief executive of the opposition can by his veto nullify or at any rate hamper the crystallizing of party policies into legisla tion or a judiciary of the other party can throw out a law passed and approved the con trol of the three parts of government is neces sary to make party control complete only in the southern states does one party democratic

our hearts for denncrecy for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own loomed under which banner p or some months previous to the special day for registering new york women in order to permit them to vote in the primaries the men having been registered previously a sweet tempered but serious minded controversy stirred the ranks of suf fragists from buffalo to montauk point the suffragists of new york are pledged to the federal suffrage amendment and to the use of their votes to see it through to its ratification by the last state it has not yet passed the senate and a minority in both parties represented in that body have manifested an incomprehen sible hostility to its passage it is clear too that since new york state has enfranchised its women by over 103,000 majority and since the legislature of the state has passed a resolution calling upon the two republican senators to support the amendment and the republican national committee and most of the republican county committees have endorsed the amendment the women have the right to expect the support of their senators senator calder gave aid to the campaign within the state and has right royally supported the federal suffrage amendment campaign but senator wadsworth is one of three men at whose door lies the entire responsibility of delay in the senate new york has much territory which is practically one party republican and other territory which is one party democratic in politics senator wadsworth’s part of the state is republican under his direct influence it defeated suffrage in 1915 and again in 1917 the two congressmen representing that part of the state voted against the federal suffrage amendment in the house and senator wadsworth has led the obstruction campaign against the amendment in the senate that the women of new york have the vote is due to sections of the state over which he has no especial influence he cost the women of the state two additional years of slavish self sacrificing campaign work and hundreds of thousands of dollars he is now costing the women of the nation thousands of dollars because of the delay which he alone has caused naturally many new york women are embittered by these facts women normally republican in politics and residing in republican territory or neutral women qualified to choose a party hesitated to enroll themselves in the party of wadsworth on the other hand the narrow minded provincial opposition of the democratic minority chiefly from the so called solid south has made democratic women and neutral women unwilling to enroll with the democrats whose enjoyment of a control of house and senate puts the main chairmanship into the hands of these anti suffragists one group of suffragists therefore is holding that until the federal suffrage amendment is ratified women should remain non partisan and throw their votes where they will be of most help to the nation wide campaign but another led by miss hay contends that the influence of women would be greater within the party than out of it that women should give to the country the best service they can render at this time of its great stress while not forgetting their objective of enfranchising the women of the nation by federal amendment as a result of the contro versy about half the new york women who will probably vote at the coming election enrolled in the primaries 679,000 the leaders of all political parties have watched this controversy with deep and understanding interest and are fully aware of the tremendous influence upon the destiny of new york politics which will be wielded by the women whose afliliations with polit ical parties are not yet made as well as by those already enrolled women voters and party alignment ver since the big pro suffrage majority was piled up in the empire state last november anxious conjecture and fore cast have done their best to tease from the future the answer to the question what strength will the women’s vote add to the republicans what to the democrats what to the socialists and what to the prohibitionists during the first months after the great november victory it was stylish in all our best political circles to stress the help given by each party in new york state according to which party you wanted women to remember next november but alas for politicians by the time the women’s enrollment dates had rolled around claims to consideration on account of the state victory had been swallowed up in claims to considera tion on account of the federal suffrage situation new york women were manifestly on the lookout and washington was what they were looking out at of the two chief parties the new york republicans have had to prop their hopes of the women’s alignment a showmg far secure nation wide suffrage to women to help hold the balance democrats pointed to president w il son’s work for the amendment a telling gesture that immediately 166 lost in force because the president do what he would was not able to prevail against certain hoary prejudices and traditions that weight his party mill stone wise it is the enrollment itself that has brought these more or less painful cogitations to a close authoritative figures at last avail able in the official enrollment returns lend weight to the insis tence of the republicans that their support of the federal suf frage amendment was sure to be a determining factor in.the party alignment of the new women voters of the 679,618 women who used the very limited opportunity afforded to become affiliated with a party 375,093 went into the republican fold as against 247,676 who enrolled as democrats moreover women form a larger proportion of the entire republi can state enrollment than of the democratic it did not need the new york line up to prove that nation wide suffrage has grown vastly in significance to women voters during recent months and to indicate that party as well as individual record on the federal suffrage amendment will be closely watched by the women between now and the november elections women are prone to get at fundamentals and to their crude minds the right of self government is fundamental to the choice of rep resentatives to do the governing their alignments may there fore be expected more and more to refiect their interest in the fortunes of the federal suffrage amendment relative party gains ne revealment in the ruthless figures of the new york 0 superintendent of elections must make bitter reading in deed to the opponents of woman suffrage according to their forecasts women of the old line parties republican and dem ocratic women would remember that woman’s place is in the home and stay there on election days while the wives and sis ters and mothers of the socialist men would pour forth to the polls by the thousands be driven to the polls rather for socialist women quoth the antis would but do the bidding of socialist men so that to give votes to socialist women would be to double the socialist vote without any compensatory addi tion to the ranks of the democrats and the republicans thus the antis in accents wild and now the new york enrollment figures in their cold and cruel realism whereas women have added 50 per cent half as much again to the registered republican strength in new york and 40 per cent or two fifths to the democratic they have added but 20 per cent one fifth to the former socialist strength just how the new york times semi official organ of the wads worthians and mrs wadsworth are to survive this shock must be a matter of some concern to the little group about them it is interesting to note in this connection that a comparison of the relative contributions to the socialist strength made by men and by women shows that if votes are to be withheld from a sex because of its superior propensity for voting the socialist ticket the franchise must be taken from men as between three and four times as many men as women will vote the socialist ticket in the woman citizen new york it is also noteworthy in view of the antis one time contention that it was the socialist vote that carried new york for suffrage that the entire socialist vote registered for the 1917 elections 67,665 could have tumbled into east river and suf frage would still have carried in new york by 35,000 majority those opposed 0 the antis who make quite a fad of leaving dead people on t their lists of those opposed there wasn’t anything funny in the situation when senator brandegee of connecticut got up in the united states senate on june 27th and had read into the record a communication that voiced a long winded protest against woman suffrage it was noticeable that during the clerk’s read ing of the communication mrs wadsworth and mrs wads worth’s husband looked summarily convinced and handled as it was the communication really sounded like a protest from a group of people who though backward were at least still alive all the more interesting the fact that it was from an organiza tion that was defunct with a president who had been for some time dead the organization which had known itself as the american constitutional league had solemnly announced its own demise to the press some weeks before on our desk at the moment lies a letter from the league addressed to a metropolitan city editor dated june 4 which reads as follows mr everett p wheeler who is now out of town has re quested me to send you a brief statement for publication an nouncing the termination of the affairs of the american constitu tional league the american constitutional league as you will recall has been working against the federal suffrage amendment for the last few weeks on the ground that its passage would be a violation of the constitutional principle of states rights for adequate reasons it is now terminating its affairs and i should appreciate very much if you would make the announcement of this fact in your columns for obvious reasons opposition to suffrage is very generally terminating its affairs and can be allowed to do so without it does seem a pity however that the senate’s time and the record’s perfectly good white paper should be consumed with ghostly wailings from the dead a great many obituary or requiem dead pe0ple and dead organizations were opposed to suffrage just as they were opposed to railroads and fiying machines and public schools but today is not yesterday and what suited the dead does not suit the living woman suffrage belongs to the present not to the past and precarious as is our opinion of some united states senators the senate itself is too dignified an insti tution to be fiouted by appeals from defunct organizations camoufiaged as still alive and entitled to consideration there are those who bury themselves in the past says one of the authoritative writers on the world’s war there are those who bury themselves in the past on whose lips are the sayings only of bygone days the traditionalists for whom an injustice has legal digitized by 600816 july 27 1918 force because it is perpetuated who aspire to be guided by the dead let us hope that against the united states senate such a charge cannot much longer lie why arkansas will ratify enator j t robinson of arkansas and the united states senate has summed up arkansas experience with suerage tersely as an illustration of how rapidly public senti ment has grown on this question he points to the fact that the women of arkansas cast their first ballot in the arkansas primary election a few weeks ago up to that time i confess there was a good deal of doubt and a good many open questions in the matter he continues but today i do not believe there are a hundred men of even average intelligence in the state who do not heartily endorse the principle of woman suffrage and realize that the women want the ballot and that they voted even more wisely than did the men they gave honest thought to their votes and the best women of the state went at the matter as a duty they owed and a privilege they had long desired arkansas will ratify the federal suffrage amendment with pleasure and without a mental reservation echoes from the past a certain senator has been accustomed whenever the subject of woman suffrage is mentioned to present in person or by mail a reprint from the congressional record of more he is so excited over the subject that when his caller comes upon an article which he himself caused to have read into it some other errand and does not mention woman suffrage he does it himself in order to present his views the pamphlet was printed in the southern review in 1871 forty seven years ago and seems to have been a standard oppo sition document ever since it has been read into the con gressional record more than once the last time in 1913 its every line represents a period so long past that it has been forgotten by the majority of folk but it becomes significant in our own day for two reasons first it undoubtedly reflects sentiments practically universal when written and therefore sets up a milestone by which to measure the world’s onward progress during these forty seven years second it presents the phenomenon of minds which have stopped in their normal operations and unobservant of changed conditions repeat parrotlike sentiments common in early youth the astonishing comment of the senator upon this reprint from the record is that it is even more pertinent at the present time than when dr bledsoe first gave it to the public he assures friends and foes that dr bledsoe’s sentiments are his a few quotations taken at random will convey some idea of what these sentiments are the root of all this mischief is the idea that woman is the equal of man she is neither equal nor superior nor inferior 167 she was made for a different sphere and in her own sphere she is without a peer or rival one star is different from another star in glory let not the sphere of woman then be confounded with that of man and let not her soul be unsexed to do the work of man unless indeed it be our object to subvert the order of nature to uproar the universal peace and pour the sweet milk of concord into hell ah ye strong minded women how ye must hate these words being in subjection unto their husbands have you no hus bands because you hate these words or do you hate these words because you have no husbands have you no husbands because the old fashioned forms require you to love honor and obey or because nobody has asked you woman is some times contemptuously called the inferior animal yes that is precisely our opinion of the sex inferior animals but superior beings in brute force in all that c0nstitutes the mere animal frame and nature women are inferior to men but in purity of mind in refinement of sentiment in all that most nearly assimi lates our race to the good angels above they are superior to men we can not deny however that although woman is the superior being she is the weaker vessel for such is the express declaration of the word of god she is evidently the weaker vessel the frailer form the more delicate organs the more sensitive and timid nature all proclaim her the weaker vessel above all the ease with which the balance of her judgment is disturbed by the impulses of kindness or of cruelty show that she is the weaker vessel while man during the civil war dis played his strength by the greatness and the heroism of his deeds woman betrayed her weakness by the violence of her sentiments she would have raised the black flag and caused it to wave in all the darkness of desolation over the heads of her enemies even to man while she was the ministering angel of mercy to her friends it is the weakness of human nature and especially in the female sex that it is always prone to rush into extremes of both hate and love there are we are sorry to say some of the sweetest and most intelligent and most lovely young ladies in our land who seem favorably inclined toward the woman’s rights movement we would do anything to save them except marry a strong minded woman and if we were a widower we fear we might be induced to do even that in order to rescue the beautiful creatures from their perilous condition c c c the modern note t would be strange indeed if after all the sacrifices that women i have made and are making for the triumph of democracy on a world scale they should be denied the equal rights without which real democracy here or anywhere is impossible times bedford mass exas women voters are smashing records the latest t word from the state suffrage president is that the first report of the women’s enrollment of 360,000 for this week’s primaries which seemed unbelievably high was incomplete the figures on july 20 were 386,000 with a possible 400,000 in sight this is more than texas men d v te digitized by 168 the woman citizen their first convention he republican state conference held for the purpose of drafting a platform took place at saratoga july 18th and 19th the democratic conference was held for the same purpose at the same place july 23rd the re publicans treated the women voters with cor dial hospitality and with keen appreciation of the fact that there is a large new electorate whose party affiliations have yet to be fixed the vast convention hall at saratoga is familiar campaign ground to suffragists most political conventions for the past genera tion have been held there and for twenty five years bands of representative women citizens of the state have appealed to platform com mittees for political liberty and in the gallery have listened to grandiloquent orations and to platforms in which such expressions as gov ernment by consent equal rights for all special privileges for none free and equal ad infinitum have been hailed with boisterous partisan applause without the slightest evi dence appearing to indicate that a single dele gate sensed an inconsistency between declara tion and realization in fact for the first time last week women were permitted to be a real part of it all over a hundred women delegates fairly representative of all sections of the state were seated and they were almost entirely drawn from the army of women who had so heroically striven to secure the ballot one suffrage worker said she had to pinch herself occasionally that she might realize that she was at last within the one time forbidden sphere instead of a suppliant still at the portals mrs edwin danforth wife of ex congress man danforth was appointed chairman of the committee to escort hon j sloat fassett temporary chairman to the platform mrs florence knapp was appointed to the cre dentials committee and several women were appointed honorary vice presidents and secre taries but the big honor fell to miss mary garrett hay chairman of the woman suf frage party of the city of new york who was made chairman of the platform com mittee a distinction which next to the chair manship is the highest in the gift of a political convention heretofore this honor has been bestowed upon acknowledged leaders of parties or old war horses whose years of party service have given repeated tests of party fealty it is safe to say that so responsible a post and so distinguished an honor were never before offered to an untried person and probably no other woman ever held the position in any state he plan to make miss hay chairman of the platform committee was not prear ranged but is reported to have been proposed in one of the early caucuses at saratoga by a one time bitter anti suffragist it is cer tain that the proposal did not come from women from the caucus the rumor spread among the gathering delegates like a bolt from the blue it fell upon friends and foes of woman suffrage one long time woman hater was heard to mutter outrageous impossible full report will follow next week it must not be permitted while another such merely uttered a despairing my god even the friends of suerage questioned the wisdom of the movement of the fifty one members composing the committee there would be many who not only were unreconstrueted antis but were adepts at parliamentary tricks whereby leaders of minorities at times trip up unskilled chairmen and get their way could a woman hold such a committee down to its work would a resentful minority dis play mob character and in order to flout the chairman prevent any business being done if a platform could really be drafted by the committee with such a chairman could a woman read it so that it could be heard by the thou sand delegates in the far reaches of saratoga’s vast convention hall these were questions passed from group to group but the proposal gained ground from moment to moment miss hay had been appointed a member of the platform committee by the 18th senato rial district and at the first meeting of the committee she was nominated by mr sam koenig chairman of new york county and was elected unanimously among the members were senator wadsworth nicholas murray butler elon brown william barnes ex governor horace white and others whose imagination had never visualized a woman member of a republican platform committee much less a chairman of one two other women members served on the committee miss mary wood of new york and mrs mary schwiedendorff of buffalo a member of the committee still harboring a little doubt said to miss hay hesitatingly you know miss hay it may mean sitting up all night that often happens oh responded miss hay i’ve sat up all night at the door of so many platform committees hoping for a suffrage resolution that that is one thing i shall not mind in the least he committee did sit till three o’clock in the morning and met again at nine a m and was ready to report at the time ordered by the convention eleven a m experienced members of the committee de clared that they had never seen a chairman make quicker decisions or fairer rulings those who enjoy odd incidents found amuse ment in the i rise to a question of parlia mentary procedure frequently put to the chairman by senator wadsworth apparently the anti suffragists bore themselves with more resignation than was expected and as a whole the men friends of suffrage were enthusiastic over the experiment and glad and happy that they had been part of the movement that had made it possible while the former foes of suffrage gave evidence of finding work with women not half so terrifying as they feared when miss hay appeared on time with the platform in her hand she was received by a standing audience and tumultous applause con tinuing without a lull a la favorite candidate for several minutes her first clear sentence resounding throughout the hall announced that she brought a unanimous report and that aroused another salvo of applause it was digitized by gods known that the platform would contain a plank on behalf of the federal suffrage amendment and that the group of anti suffragists would bring in a minority report was expected that there was none was a relief to all concerned senator wadsworth announced to the plat form committee that he would not bring in a minority report but that fact was not to be construed into the belief that he had changed his mind immediately after the planks relating to the war and the duty of the state to the nation the following plank was read the woman’s federal suffrage amend ment has passed the house of representatives by a tremendous republican vote practically every republican county committee in the state has urged its approval the decisive plurality for suffrage in this great republican state has so clearly shown the sentiment of the people that we emphatically call upon the united states senators from new york to vote for the submission of this amendment to the states the applause which followed the reading of the above resolution exceeded that of any other plank and recorded unmistakably the at titude of new york republicans on the fed eral suffrage amendment the description of the event in one news paper paid the woman chairman the compli ment of saying that she read the long instru ment of party faith so that it was not an in strument of torture which in itself is a nov elty during the reading the chairman in terrupted to say miss hay i fear the people in the gallery do not hear you whereupon she addressed herself to the gallery and asked whether she was being heard an unknown woman sitting on the topmost seat responded with clear tone yes mary which occasioned a general laugh hat miss hay performed the duties of this high office with skill and dignity is no surprise to those who know her as pre siding officer her training has covered a wide range and her repute as a tactful composed and intelligent chairman is common knowledge among women more the parliamentary train ing of women is far more extensive and able than most men realize that a woman could carry off such honors so easily may astonish some men but it is no surprise to the millions of organized american women the honor paid miss hay was a compliment to all womanhood but it was a more distinct recognition of the woman suffrage party which through its intensive organization won the vote for the women of new york it was far more clearly a suffrage that a woman’s victory in his convention address the chairman the honorable j sloat fassett made the follow ing comment on the presence of the women this convention marks an epoch in the political development of the state of new york for the first time we have sitting with us representatives of the republican women of the state of new york the franchise never moves backward there never will be contian on page 178 c july 27 1918 169 parties and primaries ast week's outlines of the functions of the parties and their reaction on each other seem to present the party system as an almost ideal engine of representative democracy but the control of government by the two great parties has been too complete they need not fear losing this power except at intervals and to each other here enters the flaw in the party system this flaw is political corruption the great parties too often lose sight of their platforms or regard them merely as idle promises with which to catch votes the statesman says ray regards control through political parties as a means of carry ing through beneiicial legislation the poli tician uses it as a means of acquiring pres tige and financial gain for himself through control of legislatures through control of party and government funds and through patronage or power to appoint to otlice the politician is able to further his own interests within the great party organizations there have grown up machines which adopted the party organization to the advancement of a group or rings organized about an indi vidual a boss who very often does not hold office but controls the officeholders ell known examples are the tam many machine in the democratic or ganization and the pennsylvania ring in the republican organization besides patronage which has been attacked by competitive civil service examinations and though by no means done away with is not to day as great an evil as it was some of the methods by which the corrupt politician has controlled are thus described by a political leader years ago says patrick mccabe demo cratic leader of albany county the bullies of the day played a most important part in our politics it was very often upon their brawn and muscle that momentous questions of state devolved they met and fought in the streets for the possession of the polls the vanquished side leaving the victors to operate the election to their own sweet will this was followed by a period of ballot box stuffing in which the opposing election omcers vied with one another in placing illegal votes in the boxes this made way for the activities of a class known as repeaters and who on election day went from one poll to another throughout the city re peating or voting on names furnished them by the respective party workers the repeating evil gave way to the present day corruption the purchasing of the electorate at the polls more subtle method of control used in modern days is thus described by lynn haines secretary of the national voters league for a decade politicians have been employ ing the subtler and safer way of getting re sults by manipulating public opinion in other words the educating of public opin ion for the statesman’s ends has been replaced by the debauching of public opinion for the politician’s ends instead of being says mr haines an agency for the common welfare modern poli tics has become an end in itself this end being albany evening journal january 30 1918 part two by mary sumner boyd ofiice and the ever increasing perquisites in his book your congress mr haines shows in national affairs how the very ma chinery of congress is adapted to his own ends by the politici_an he shows how national legislation itself is directed toward getting votes in the last short session of the 63rd con gress says he there were passed 244 bills and resolutions of this number 229 related to one or another of the basic elements in the political system patronage or pork less than 30 were measures in which the general public had an interest pork is a term descriptive of a measure which secures some benefit to a member’s home district at national expense for example a civil war pension a post office or other local public improvement s each of the great parties when it takes its turn at oiiice takes its share at the spoils neither can make any very determined attack on the other’s corruption the result is a bi partisan system of political plunder oh we fight some on little things like the tariff one politician is quoted as saying of the opposite party 1 but we agree on the main issue that them as works in politics is entitled to make a living out of it bossism prof dealey tells us is a passing phase in party history its passing may be slow it may never be complete for it may as in great britain persist in the subtler though destroyed in the cruder forms through civil service reform it has already been attacked in the united states publicity has done some good in correcting the debauching of public opinion registration laws have been a help the most important step toward reform has been the recognizing of the parties by law and putting them on a semi ofiicial basis this is the work of this generation for up to then the power behind the government had no legal recognition it has taken the form of control of the nomination of party candidates and su pervision of their campaigns for oiiice one of these two forms of legislation is corrupt practices acts for the regulation by the state of the collection and expenditure of campaign funds so that they shall not be ob tained by force or fraud or used for bribery a federal act aims to control federal cam paigns and most states now have corrupt practices acts though most of these acts are very inadequate some states not only limit candidates ex penses but bear part of them the state of oregon mails some publicity literature for can didates of all parties at state expense and col orado contributes a certain percentage of each candidate’s campaign expenses the other form of legislation is direct pri mary laws by which all elections are controlled conducted and paid for by the state held at a stated time before the election of candidates for see also the monthly searchlight on congress published by the national voters league wood ward bldg washington d c 1 your congress p 46 oiiice in the case of general elections several weeks before the rank and file of the party membership nominate the party candidates previous to primary legislation methods of nominating were various the method in most general use was nomination by convention delegates of these nominating conventions were occasionally nominated by the party mem bers an old form of primary which is to be distinguished from the direct primary for the nomination of the candidates for office them selves these party conventions were made up of professional politicians who chose candi dates of their own stamp how corrupt the make up of a nominating convention could be is shown by the following description quoted by ray of a convention held in cook county 111 in 1896 out of 723 delegates 17 had been tried for murder 7 had served sentence for murder or manslaughter 36 for burglary 2 were pick pockets there were 84 other jail birds 9 kept gambling houses or houses of ill fame 11 were prizeiighters and 275 were saloon or pool room keepers ith the convention system so debased it was time the people took a hand in mak ing nominations and ceased to content them selves with voting on election day for a slate prepared by such party representatives as those described the system of nomination by con vention possessed the further disadvantage that it removed the people still further from direct government the movement for direct pri maries is therefore one aspect of the move ment toward direct democracy to regain control over the government says prof macy the people have taken the nominating process away from the parties and made it a state func tion the party is thus a legalized agent of the state to day some form of primary law exists in all states except new mexico which still ad heres to the convention system primary elec tions for all parties take place on the same day in a few states where the open sys tem is in force also at the same polling place they are conducted at state expense on state ballots by state election boards and under state control many primary laws also regulate the method of nominating party committees and the powers of these committees beyond this there is little unformity or stand ardization in the primary laws of the various states many are very inadequate and rudi mentary a list made by the pennsylvania legislative reference bureau a few years ago showed that about two thirds of the states had direct primary laws most of them states wide in scope that is covering all and not merely local candidates and most of them mandatory an optional law that is one which allows choice between convention and primary nomina tions is of little value a more recent analysis 1917 of nominations for congress showed that under state laws all but seven states nomi nate these candidates by direct primaries this is probably a good index to the number of states which now have state wide direct pri maries 1 an up to date list and analysis is being prepared by thcman's bu of the

establish her epiciency in this era of civilisation and by her achievements prove to the world that the masculine sex has no monopoly upon genius for the first time in the history of our nation have the industries of this country to any extent depended upon the services of woman they do now and there is no doubt that the woman of america will rise and meet the emergency as women have always done and the only reward expected will be that they too shall share to the fullest extent in the new democracy which is now struggling for existence florence king ne good thing about life it quite fre quently answers its own problems there is the problem of woman’s relation to the gain ful occupations call it economic independence of women and about seven out of ten scurry to cover frightened by what looks in theory like menace to home and family along comes life and makes the point through family priva tion and suffering in the home that the old division of labor men outside of the house and women inside it doesn’t work any more and that not to utilize women’s productive ca pacity on the outside is to impose an un bearable economic burden on men make a para sitic growth of women and deny both quantity and quality to the wbrld’s aggregate output in answer to life’s acute showing women file out into industry by the hundreds of thousands into trade by the hundreds of thousands into the professions by the thousands the home mean time adjusts itself so easily that it dawns upon the stupidest that it is after all only the loss of its manufacturing function its dairying spinning baking function that we are howling about in most of the outcry about the loss of home that’s another good thing about life what is is and the stupidest has eventually to ac cept it tupidity has made it possible however and continues to make it possible to retard woman’s progress in the gainful occupations some of it has been women’s own stupidity our stupid acquiescence in the traditional value of women and some of it has been men’s neither women nor men have been able readily to take woman’s relation to industry to business as a permanent relation and both women and men have been dominated by the conviction that woman’s business ability must always be subor dinated to man’s that she must always be kept in the minor places that even if she does the work forsooth she mustn’t have the place or the salary the worst thing the farthest reaching about this conviction is that it is vaguely back grounded in a sort of clouded religious feeling that the male is god’s chosen provider and that to let woman out and up is somehow to go against god there is nothing so gripping women and as a clouded religious feeling to be sure the female was god’s chosen provider in the beginning but we are so far from the be ginning and have drunk so much poor coffee in the meantime that we have grown hazy n spite of stupidities and convictions how ever individual women have kept pushing on and up clearing their minds of the encum brances of tradition as they have climbed and all along the way they have kept up a ding dong insistence on progress on the illimitable goal it was a revelation to many to learn last week that that ding dong had at last gathered suliicient force and volume in america to be heard all over the union and that in response to it a great gathering of business women nine hundred the papers said came together in cincinnati from thirty two dieerent cities for the express purpose of amplifying the ideal and extending the goal for the busi ness and professional woman

some man to reap its credit and salary for the sheer sake of shouldering initiative and responsibility over on him the business world is far fuller today of women than of men in the minor business positions the dynamic difference between them is that nine out of ten of the men have their eyes on the major positions nine out of ten of the women don’t they are afraid of the major positions when you add to their own fear the inhospitality and actual inhibitions to their progress imposed by men you have built up a fairly insuperable barrier between women and big business this woman’s association of commerce that is today taking the lead in developing women’s business initiative and in securing to them new standards of achievement is just a year old but already it has organized state associations in ohio indiana michigan illinois missouri new york california and the district of columbia its unit is not the individual but the organization it is essentially a federation of

commerce for instance the syracuse new york chamber of commerce has two women members mrs adele blauvelt and mrs frederick hazard ccurate figures are not yet available to cover the great influx of women into in dustry trade and transportation since the war began but that women's line of gainful occupa tions has increased until there is literally no limit is current news but individual abilities and activities of women are never so impressive as they are when rounded up into an organization sometimes an individual woman who is making a remarkable record of practical achievement is afilicted and inhibited by traditions and prejudices against the theory of woman’s business development and so is set against herself confusingly and in the end destructively she acts right but thinks wrong she takes for herself usually under the spur of necessity all the advantage of the open door for women but disapproves of women doing it in general i once knew a woman manufacturer like that i know a prominent woman journalist who seems to be similarly motived it isn't selfishness that is responsible it is uneasy fear a triste outlook it is in p the development of the community spirit toward the open door it is in the dispelling of fear and the instilling of courage and the forcing of initiative that organization has its great part to play among business women it is that function that signalizes the woman's as sociation of commerce it is the full and fine self apprehension of the function that makes the outlook for its vast success so roseate will women ever vie with men as financiers as producers as managers as distributors as buyers and sellers who knows who cares vying is not the point at all the point is that whatever ability women may have as finan ciers producers managers distributors buyers and sellers shall be realized to the full when ever and wherever it is needed the point is that woman shall be limited only by that ability not by blank walls of tradition and prejudice on which men have blandly written thus far and no farther r y 172 the woman citizen senators lords and women’s progress rs pankhurst is reported as say ing i wonder if your senators rea lize that they are now actually less progressive than the conservative and reactionary house of lords the body of lawmakers that they once used to ridicule is now ahead of them in demo cratic measures now this is not quite fair to the united states senate it is true that the house of lords has passed the woman suffrage measure while the united states senate has not yet done so but the lords passed it by a vote of a little less than two to one if our senate like the house of lords could do it by a simple ma jority vote it would have been passed long ago the united states is the only civilized country that requires a two thirds vote that is why we are delayed on the woman question the american senate and the house of lords seem to be about neck and neck mrs pankhurst might with truth have boasted of the british house of commons however the lower house of congress voted for woman suf frage a little more than two to one but the house of commons voted for it seven to one that magnificent majority left both the lords and our own senators far behind but when our senate does pass it there will be no thirty year age limit for women as in england we have no temptation to resort to that device to keep the women voters in a minority because in the united states the women are normally less numerous than the men gains of a hundred years he lucy stone centennial reminds us how wonderfully the world has changed for women in the last hundred years when lucy stone was born it was looked upon as utterly improper for a woman to speak in public even to write for publication was considered unfeminine the gentle charles lamb himself said the woman who lets her self be known as an author invites disrespect a woman who had her living to earn was‘rig idly restricted by public opinion to a very few poorly paid occupations there was not a col lege in the united states that admitted women there was not a free public high school for girls there were few organizations of women even to join a temperance society was consid ered unwomanly a married woman had no rights over her children her husband had absolute control over her property and earnings if she earned a dollar by taking in washing it was his dollar not hers if her employer paid the money to her the husband could require it to be paid over again to him she could not make a valid will without her husband’s consent unless she left everything to him in which case it was assumed that his consent would not be lacking she could not sue or be sued her legal existence was said to be suspended during marriage husband and wife were one and that one was the husband he had the right to lock her up and in most states the right to beat her in moderation this had been defined by a learned judge as meaning that the stick must not be thicker than the judge's thumb but the legal disabilities of women heavy as they were were less crushing than the weight by alice stone blackwell women never realize their inability to ef fect a reform until they attempt it and then they find how closely interwoven with politics are all such matters and how without political power are they themselves 5 b a of public opinion every man was brought up to believe that he had a divinely ordained right to rule over his wife every woman was edu cated to believe that it was her duty to submit the belief in women’s inferiority both of na ture and status was practically universal it wrapped every girl child around from her cradle up like a invisible strait jacket it is good for our young women to look back ward now and then at the pit from which they were digged it is hard for them to rea lize that gentle and virtuous women were ever mobbed and ostracized merely for making public speeches upon philanthropic subjects and that this was done in america within the memory of persons now living the world has been largely revolutionized in its attitude toward women but all those ancient limitations and disabilities had to be demolished piecemeal one by one after years of hard and laborious hammering away by the friends of equal rights the removal of each one was fought by the conservatives as stub bornly as the federal amendment is now being fought by a handful of wilful men in the united states senate and with just as sincere a conviction that the change would wreck the home and ruin womanliness ida m tarbell who is not a suffragist says that every woman of today in the enjoyment of a broader life owes a debt of gratitude to the pioneer advocates of equal rights among the bravest and sweetest of these was lucy stone and the changed world for women today is a monument to her and her co workers underpaid teachers he shortage of teachers is also calling at tention to the fact that the 740,000 teach ers in the united states receive an average salary of considerably less than 600 a year a trifle over 10 per week think of that with the cost of living what it is to day and if this is the average salary it means that a mul titude of teachers are paid even less susan b anthony well said when this subject was discussed in a teachers convention many years ago that the profession would always be at a disadvantage so long as the great majority of teachers belonged to a disfranchised sex there is also a pervasive and persistent ten dency to think that women’s pay ought not to be high not long ago an effort was made in boston to have women teachers given equal pay with men for equal work the authorities said oh no a man must have higher pay than a woman because he has a family to sup port at about the same time an investiga tion was going on to determine what should be the minimum wage for the scrub women digitized by 600816 who clean boston’s great obice buildings al most all of them are widows with children the women on the investigating committee wanted this fact taken into consideration in de termining what should be recommended as a living wage for this class of workers but most of the men on the committee said oh no the pay must be according to the service ren dered it would be out of the question to in crease a worker’s pay on account of the num ber of her children they even argued at first that the minimum wage for a widow with children should be less than that of a single woman living alone and should be reckoned on the same basis as that of a daughter living at home that is if a widow was supporting six children they would have estimated a liv ing wage for her as one seventh of what it cost to maintain that home however the women on the committee finally made them see the injustice of this it was a striking example of the importance of having women on all boards that deal with questions relating to women's work but the general rule laid down in the case of the scrub women was just the opposite of that laid down in the case of the teachers for the teachers the basis of pay must not be serv ice rendered but family obligations for the scrubwomen the basis of pay could be only service rendered and family obligations must not be allowed to count in each case the rule adopted was that which would result in lower pay for the woman another delusion shattered he war is knocking out many nonsensical ideas some of which the advocates of equal rights had hammered away at for years without success one is the doctrine that a married woman cannot teach school without neglecting her children just now there is an acute shortage of teachers owing to the much higher pay that educated women are offered in various war industries and so we see boards of education that had forced teachers to resign upon marrying now earnestly imploring those married teachers to return to the schools if they really believe what they used to tell us that this would compel these women to sacrifice the welfare of their children what business have they to urge any mother to wrong her own offspring but as soon as they are in a tight place and really need the married woman’s services they see that in many cases it is quite possible to adjust domestic affairs in such a way that the children will not suffer are women protected mazing revelations of profiteering are brought out in the recent report of a federal commission the overcharging of the public for food is declared to have been espe cially exorbitant these exposures recall the question asked by the anti sulfragists a few years ago when it was said that women needed the ballot for protection the antis demanded scornfully protection from what well from many things and among others from food sharks july 27 1918 the time ongress must be convinced that the time has come for the enfranchisement of the women of america said mrs a l bailey president of the vermont equal suffrage association when addressing the annual con vention of the suffragists of vermont leg islatures must think nationally for government of the people by the people and for the people is a world question plans for a state wide ratification campaign were laid at this convention which was held july 10 and 11 at the hotel sherwood burl ington it was a rousing convention well at

burlington in welcoming the convention said editorially it is hoped that the present session of congress may see the submission to the states of the proposed amendment to the constitution look ing to the extension of political justice to women the news of burlington also speaking editorially said of especial moment is this year’s session both because of the growing par ticipation of women in the elections of vermont with the partial extension of the franchise and of the fact that the fate of the national suffrage amendment is hanging in the balance as in the case of daylight saving when these two things national suffrage and prohi bition have been accomplished the only ques tion will be why it took mere man so long to see the advantages of the step ma n the war x of a e _r'r ill fa 1u lg i

to pass it immediately the resolution further asked that the arkansas legislature at its session in 1919 ratify the amendment at the earliest opportunity in the event that it is passed by the sixty fifth con gress the resolution cited that the adoption of the amendment was desired as a war measure this action was taken by the con vention at little rock on july 14 he democrats of arkansas in convention at little rock on july 11 wrote the fol lowing plank in their platform believing that just governments derive their powers from the consent of the governed and in confirmation of the action taken by national democratic convention we stand for full and unlimited suffrage for women the resolutions committee unanimously en dorsed the following resolution we heartily approve extending the fran chise to women and urge senators and con gressmen to support all the measures now or hereafter pending in congress looking to pas sage of a federal amendment to the constitu tion of the united

committee and a member of the resolutions committee of the democratic convention in addressing the con vention at the afternoon session thanked the democratic party for giving the women a voice in their councils and praised their liberal spirit toward the women in the convention she de clared women do not want to run the state government but only to help run it mrs cotnam said women favor the adoption of a new constitution she believes the need for one has been made greater because of the war a headline in the arkansas gazette states vomen delegates prove they are no figure 173 has come heads and then the writer continues whatever else may be said it cannot be asserted that the women are not taking a keen interest in the convention proceedings this was one of the causes of complaint of the old timers they wailed that the women insisted on having every little detail explained to them and that the fair ones constantly were on the alert for fear that something might be put over on them in their unfamiliarity with the wiles of the politicians there were far more women delegates pres ent in proportion to their representation than there were men they attended in force all such perfunctory proceedings as minor com mittee meetings and they controlled the actions of some of these committees it may safely be said that absolutely nothing was put over on them by the wily politicians there wasn’t a chance not a chance in the world or the first time in the history of arkansas democracy and possibly for the first time in the history of politics in the south accord ing to the press of arkansas a woman was elected a member of the state central com mittee mrs stella brizzolara of fort smith holds this honor having been elected at the caucus of the delegates from the twelfth judicial district one of the finest things about the conven tion to my mind was the consideration and gallantry shown the women members by the men mrs brizzolara is quoted as saying sueragists versus brewers tax payers suit is on in the common pleas court in franklin county ohio to test the constitutionality of a proposed amend ment to the ohio state constitution making the ratification of federal amendments by the legislature subject to referendum the proposed amendment is initiated by the ohio home rule association the wets the national american woman suerage associa tion is bringing suit at the request of the ohio woman suffrage association in order to settle the question for the whole country the taxpayers suit stands in the name of edgar l vveinland of columbus plaintiff mr weinland is one of the leading attorneys of the capital city a member of the commission that framed the columbus charter a trustee of oberlin university and a member of the local draft board he is acting as plaintiff purely in conformity to his ideals of right his attorney in the suit is frank davis jr in his petition for mr weinland mr davis alleges that the proposed amendment is in effect an amendment to the united states constitu tion a matter in which the ohio constitution is powerless in view of this unconstitutionality mr davis asks for his client that the secretary of state be restrained from expending any moneys out of the public funds for printing ballots pub lishing and distributing pamphlets and argu ments for and against the proposal he claims that it will cost the state at least 25,000 to put to vote the question which if carried would be null and void continued on page 178 174 forty years of struggle n a review of the forty years of unbroken struggle for the passage of the federal suffrage amendment conducted by the national american woman suffrage association mrs carrie chapman catt president of the asso ciation calls attention to the fact that from the year 1878 when miss anthony then secretary first got the suffrage measure introduced into congress until today there has not been a ses sion of house or senate that has not been im portuned in behalf of the measure by the association it has been a long and weary struggle and the victory can not come too soon the burden of carrying war work and suffrage work is almost too heavy for even work inured suf fragists to endure said mrs catt for years it was miss anthony’s habit to come in person to washington to plead before house or senate committee that had the measure in charge she brought other women with her women famous in history of the last century women like julia ward howe mary a livermore isabel beecher hooker eliza beth cady stanton etc they were the hrst suffrage lobby that washington ever knew 5 rom the beginning the association’s pro gram was conditioned by the need of winning a sufficient number of states to suf frage by the state route to make it possible to win the nation to suffrage by the federal route in those early days miss anthony and her co workers were strongly imbued with the idea that they were to stand not upon the order of getting suffrage but get it and the plan of the national association was divided between state referenda and the federal suffrage amend ment now one now the other according to the exigency of the times year by year the asso ciation has carried forward this dual program winning a state here a state there and year by year keeping up the agitation and the educa tion on the subject of federal suffrage the whole force of argument for the fed eral suffrage as political leaders understand forceful argument has lain all along in the number of women who might have to be reckoned with as a national voting unit quite aside from the question of sex solidarity women who have been enfranchised do not take kindly to disfranchisement incurred through crossing a state border their thought and ambition turn toward federal suffrage as the agency through which they will be assured the same national protection in their voting rights as men enjoy up to the year 1910 the number of voting women was negligible the total number of electoral votes which they had a share in determining was only nine v'vashing ton came into the full suffrage column that year under the banner of the national ameri can woman suffrage association bringing five more electoral college votes in 1911 cali fornia swung into line and in 1912 kansas arizona and oregon were counted in in 1913 illinois women won presidential and municipal suffrage in 1914 nevada and montana were won to full suffrage in 1917 the national american woman suffrage association inaugu rated its drive for presidential suffrage the legislatures of six states responded favorably one state arkansas granted its women primary suffrage which in a one party state is equiva lent to full suffrage and vermont granted state wide municipal suffrage in november new york’s great victory was won the year 1918 has been signalized by the winning of primary suffrage in texas years ago i was traveling with miss anthony on one of those state campaigning tours which she used to have us all make with everlasting regularity how many states i asked her shall we have to win before we shall be strong enough to give over this round of state referenda and focus our whole strength on congress and the federal suffrage amend ment she was thoughtful for a minute and then replied i don’t know how many states we shall have to win but i feel sure that when the time comes we shall know it beyond per adventure of a doubt the time has come and we do know it beyond peradventure of a doubt while we have been winning states year by year we have not lost sight of our federal objective year by year the association’s federal program has been intensified and broadened and year by year the focus on that program has grown sharper in place of the old flying squadron that miss anthony used to bring to washing ton there was established years ago a perma nent congressional committee with washing ton headquarters the personnel of this committee has been composed from time to time of women of political acumen and its firing line early became a highly specialized training ground for the suffrage lobbyist the chairmanship of the committee has been held by well known women from various parts of the country at various times during this most highly critical year and a half mrs maud wood park of massa chusetts has been the chairman and to her untiring diligence and political skill women attribute the highly favorable outlook today but on the eve of success for this long drawn struggle the valiant service of the women of the present is commingled with the service of the women of the past and no one worthy of the name of suffragist is concerned today as to what workers or to what stage of the work credit for the impending victory is due it is enough that victory is near the woman citizen ratification prospects reparatory to the ratification cam paigns which will be formally launched the moment the senate passes the federal amend ment the state suffrage associations through out the country are getting everything in shape for quick action already candidates for po4 litical ohice are being put on record as regards their attitude on the ratification of the amend ment st louis suffragists sent out a ques tionnaire to all candidates for the legislature from that district in order to find out their standing when a vote for the amendment shall come before the 50th general assembly of missouri the result has been satisfactory many replies have already been received pledg ing the candidates to ratification indiana suffragists believing that women of the state are anxious to know how the nom inees for the next session of the legislature stand on suffrage have published the list of successful candidates who have declared them selves friends of suffrage the list is long and speaks well for speedy ratification by th legislature of that state enator william m calder of new york says new york state by a majority of over 100,0 has given its women the vote and when the senate passes the federal amendment i have no doubt that the new york legislature will immediately ap prove it in fact i am sure it will for i am in receipt of a resolution adopted by both branches of the legislature by almost an unan imous vote approving the federal amendment and urging me to vote for it senator miles poindexter of washington an ardent believer in the amendment says that the entire west long ago overcame the pre judice which troubles some parts of the coun try and is intensely interested in the outcome of the vote in the senate the experience of many years has confirmed the deep conviction in the west which will ratify the amendment at the first opportunity senator morris sheppard of the lone star state which gave women the primary vote in the last legislature declares that the sentiment in favor of woman suffrage has grown so rapidly in texas in the past year that i be lieve it is now strongly in favor of the passage of the federal amendment by this session of the senate and that texas will ratify at the next session of the legislature texas realizes that the united states cannot consistently stand before the world as the leader and champion of democracy while refusing to establish a democracy at home by denying self government to half its people ittite tablets in the university of penn sylvania museum recently deciphered by prof sayce of oxford show that men and women shared the government in the cities of an empire which stretched from the mediter ranean to the black sea each province says the new york herald was subdivided into cities and these were supervised by a mayor and prefectress whose powers were co ordinate in one instance the woman mayor had an official status independent of the male official july 27 1918 arizona’s men leglslators ouquets verbal and floral fell to the lot of arizona’s women legislators from the men legislators on the closing day of the special session of the legislature a few weeks ago beautiful bouquets were sent to the desk of the ladies and mrs o’neil of maricopa county as spokesman for all three women acknowledged the gifts as well as the con tinued courtesies of the liberal men of the legislature it would seem that the men of the arizona house are proud of what their women colleagues have achieved and didn’t hesitate to tell them so representative cook complimented each woman on the excellent measures she had mothered to successful enactment this special legislature was a war ses sion and its keynote was one of patriotism one of the most conspicuous bills pre sented was a 100 per cent american bill proposed by mrs theodore marsh of negales the lady from santa cruz 1 democratic representative k38 pauline o’neil of mabicopa among the bills put through in the regular legislative session of 1917 by mrs marsh who is president of a large hardware business and its successful manager was a public welfare bill she is known also as the sponsor of the child welfare bill mrs marsh inherited her big business from her husband’s estate she is a widow with two daughters mrs pauline o’neil of phoenix has secured legislation on educational measures during the two sessions of arizona’s third legislature mrs rosa mckay the lady from cochise is known as the mother of the minimum wage bill the winning of which in the arizona leg

in the same legislature now congratulating her upon her victory the organized majority of the house mrs theodoba marsh of santa cruz was lined up against her she carried the bill to the senate herself

london bankers and has been cabled to america according to the reports women were first admitted to em ployment in british banks with fears and mis givings on the part of the directors lest the women divulge the business secrets all this is changed now according to the bankers magazine which says it is gratifying to think that after three years experience with the new conditions no ground whatever

says the los angeles tribune it has been in answer to a public demand for definite service or in calm deliberate recognition of woman’s share in the privileges and burdens of the state rather than an expression of indi vidual political ambition or desire for no toriety in other words woman’s desire for the ballot is proven to be in protection of the home in loyalty to the country in a deep interest of the well being of humanity and an inborn passion for effective service in every right activity there is thus far a singleness and sincerity of purpose shown in woman’s use of the ballot which men in general might well emulate he washington state federation of labor will welcome to its ranks women who enter the various industries that men may be released for military service according to a statement reported to have been made by w m short presi mrs rosa mckay of cochise dent of the state federation of labor at the annual convention of that body held recently at aberdeen he also stated that equal pay for women union members with that accorded men working in similar capacities will be de manded by organized labor it is the intention of federated labor to work for laws which will place stronger safeguards about women and children workers when the legislature convenes lthough the election was thrown out by the austrian government on the ground that the election of a woman was unconstitu tional nevertheless the free choice of the people sent a woman mme vikora kuneticka to the prague constituent assembly which met last january he united states food administration has issued 20,000 diplomas to college girls who have completed food conservation courses 1‘76 the woman citizen the half loaf of dutch women n may let the lists of candidates for the parliamentary election of july was pub lished and it is not without interest for suffra gists since december 12 1917 the women of holland have enjoyed the singular position of half enfranchised citizens the dutch legislators in their inscrutable wisdom having judged them worthy of governing town and country not of deciding who is to govern strange anomaly but the will of the people speaks in no uncer tain fashion the political parties both old and new ones have given women a place on their list of candidates and some quite favorable places too so our premier who has always prided himself on studying and carrying out the will of the people can now see that the dutch nation is determined to have the women by the side of the men in the government of the state accordingly political parties of old standing like the liberals and newly formed ones like the economical league have each tried to find women for their lists who might be expected to have public favor and to win a number of votes for the party it is expected that some of the women candidates will be elected the total number of female candidates is twenty scattered over the lists of nine parties t has been interesting to observe the effect of the new system of proportional repre sentation on our electorate however this effect cannot be studied apart from the great change in the functions of state and govern ment occasioned by the war the task of these bodies having now developed into becoming an instrument for finding and distributing pro by martina g kramers visions for the community in addition to their old task of protecting acquired property the opinion of the electors now all the men over 25 years old has felt the influence of the unprece dented circumstances in which we live and new groups of people holding similar opinions have been formed many accuse our parliament and each and all of its members of drowning the needs of the country in a flood of words in stead of acting as circumstances demand this feeling has made people rebellious against our ruler our parliament and even the whole par liamentary system and in addition to this two or three groups of workers and employees have considered it profitable to try and get one or two of their men into parliament regardless of public interest and bound only to speak for their groups of actors farmers retail dealers sub altern soldiers police or firemen the general discontent has given rise to various new parties all beginning by claimng that they wanted to have nothing to do with politics that de testable thing nevertheless they are promptly obliged to form political parties if they would be at all represented in parliament and have any power in the government of the country group of women too have taken up an anti political attitude and have split off from the dutch woman suffrage association putting their specific women’s claims to the fore and repudiating any alliance with or help frorn political parties they fail to explain how vote less women can ever hope to win the govern ment’s ear for their claims or its power for the realization of those claims however disdain ing the support of any group of electors these women have now founded a neutral voman suffrage association and a league to promote the election of women to parliament and mu nicipalities needless to say this band of women is small and their influence next to nothing meanwhile the dutch woman suffrage asso ciation is losing no opportunity of urging the women’s right tq participation in the nation’s affairs and especially to the vote by upholding the views of suffragists in all public discussions the names of twenty women on sundry lists of candidates gives us a good starting point for our argumentation our president dr aletta jacobs is no 3 on the list of the radicals our vice president mrs van balenklaar on that of the liberal union and many more members of the w s a occupy different places on other lists besides the socialists have put up six women candi dates two of whom are nearly sure of elec tion miss suze groeneweg member of the s d party executive is no 3 and mrs carrie pothins smit is no 4 of the list so we may hope to see women enter our second chamber in september with the encouraging example of denmark before us we feel sure of success on july 3rd the day of our parliamentary election martina g kramers one of the women candidates miss groeneweg was elected detroit business women meet ichigan women organized a state wide association of commerce last february and late in june of this year a two days con vention of 600 representatives from all over the state was held in detroit under the direc tion of the detroit business woman’s club the object of this first convention of michigan business women was to organize all self sup porting women into a body effective for han dling problems of vital interest to women in civic industrial and professional lines and to stimulate the formation of local associations probably the largest gathering of business women ever held in the united states sat down to the banquet presided over by mrs lena lake forrest president of the detroit business woman’s club and also president of the michi gan woman’s association of commerce at the business session suffrage was unani mously endorsed a resolution endorsing equal work for equal pay was also unani mously adopted as well as one endorsing the plan of the national business woman’s com mittee for co operation in war work with the national board of the y n c a this plan is designed to bring about greater efficiency in business and to promote and protect the interests of all business women a bureau of information was established for the use of all business and professional women of the state and through this bureau information regarding positions may be obtained the detroiter says that there is a new place for women in the esteem of the community on account of the big financial war campaigns in which women have developed unsuspected capacity for a long time women were rarely seen in board of commerce rooms except at an oc casional evening entertainment then they be gan to appear in small numbers at committee meetings and other gatherings at the liberty loan meetings they were numerously repre sented in the galleries and now at the pa triotic fund gatherings they have been given the front six rows of seats on the main floor of auditorium next thing you know some one will be proposing a plan under which they may be admitted to membership and the directorate of the board of commerce at any rate the record they have made in war activities will add thousands of affirmatives to the vote on the equal suffrage amendment next november n years gone by under the old regimen every i woman looked so naturally to home making as the acme of her ambition that it is hard for the women who are going into business to see that initiative is the principal thing required in a business career it seems natural for woman to strike for second rather than first place but that is also the case with a large majority of men as you doubtless know in everything in which women assume positive direction they succeed as well as men but the trouble is that they so rarely are willing to take the whiphand how many generations of suffragists will have to come and go before the customary habit of mind of woman may change is a matter in the realm of prophecy but when she comes to understand what she really needs to do in order to compete with strong men in the most effective way she will doubtless play the higher part which is possible to women who have the higher capacity there are just as many women per hundred who are specially capable in all directions as men but the sex has not yet discovered that this is the truth

to remain here mrs raymond brown is perfectly fine and after talking it over with the medicin chef and miss mckee they decided that i should stay and i’m delighted i'm telling the truth when i say i never felt better in my life miss mc kee and her friend miss wilbur are wonders and take the best care of us i am one of the luckiest people in the world to be able to do this work why it’s wonderful and i am thankful to feel that i am truly helping we take down dressings wash the wounds shave and put on temporary dressings and the patients are ready for the operation you see we get the blessés direct from the trench dress ing stations as they come to us only to be operated upon and evacuate the next day if possible to a hospital further in to make room for others we have been and are terribly busy now yesterday we had nearly all germans to pre pare it is a good sign when we get so many german prisoners most of them are mere babies not more than eighteen years old not much younger than their wise nurse although there were a few older ones among them this class of germans are certainly fooled into be lieving all sorts of crazy things one said seri ously that he thought the kaiser was in paris the germans seem so much dirtier in every way than the french and are alive with mary averell brown the very youngest nurse at the military unit cooties i’ve only seen one cootie on a frenchman i’m feeling creepy to day and i’m going to comb my hair with a tine tooth comb and am hoping for the best most of the french doctors are just as decent to the germans as they are to the french i think this is quite wonderful of them from the refugee hospital by anne curry special correspondence from france ver here we are already blasé little sur prises us so we glance through the 051cc door and down the hill in a sandy hollow we see the rear view of a very masculine pair of blue overalls the overalls seat themselves with a tired thump and we are not at all thrilled to catch the sunburned face of a man we know better it is mrs griliith beneath the broad hat she is building an incinerator not that she or any other woman to our knowledge ever built an incinerator for a hospital before but that an incinerator is needed for the burning of dressings and so an incinerator is built and built well we may add c’est la guerrel again on top of the kitchen astride the peaked roof sits a khaki clad figure minus the dignity of skirts blows from a well directed hammer assert that the stovepipe is in proper place to stay again a woman works our chauffeur driving to yesterday discovered that one of her pets sorosis was not running smoothly under the car in a mo ment stretched full length discovered of course by a passing french motor but disdain fully and politely declining masculine aid and so it goes women are building pump drains laying boardwalks putting up shelves repairing engines and doing these things with what tools and materials they can get for both are scarce and perhaps defective lumber is not thoroughly dried and warps almost im mediately a good planing tool is almost not to be had and one’s ingenuity is sadly taxed to ac complish the task that must be done well and quickly even the tools and equipment that can be purchased here are priced at figures out of all comparison with their value even with the real need for them in the oliice the situa tion is the same for one bottle of good ameri can ink which is not to be had the book keeper and secretary would willingly sacrifice their allowances of butter index files are so extravagantly priced that it is beyond all rea son to buy them so our agile minded car penter is building one for us as she has built an ohice desk of pine one for the typewriter and supplied divers other necessities on which we r_ fcliai i_ a i one of the luckiest people in the world who is thankful she is truly helping try to save money metal clips such as are counted by the hundred gross in every ameri can otiice are not to be obtained down here we use tiny bits of transparent gummed tape such as are used to mend music and books with back home if the filing becomes heavy a precious pin is stuck in and guarded with jealous eye every scrap of paper is used in some way both sides and the wastebasket is the least busy of all the office force every department of the hospitals and the work relating to its carry on is facing the same condition of insullicient and inferior tools but it is excellent training for the inventive mind and for the temper he opening of our hospital on sunday june 23 was a great success the en tire village and more was represented the prefet in all his glory and accompanied by his four counselors made a most charming and gracious speech the minizan band added much to the festivities and the school children sing ing the national anthem ours in english which they had learned in three days were very touching indeed the simple refreshments seemed to appeal to every one we had lem onade and pastries and coffee i spent the day after writing letters of thanks to those who took part and will you believe me every single one wrote and thanked us for writing i tell you the french will not be out done in courtesy needed for the women’s oversea hospitals bed gowns for men long and short bath gowns of cotton flannel to keep bulk as small as possible

avenue new york city n8 their first convention continued from page 168 in the future a time when the women will not share with us equally the rights and the duties of citizenship i am not one of those who ever regarded this revolutionary proceeding with either dread or suspicion or opposition i never could see any good reason why the state should deprive itself of the assistance of the better half of its citizenry i have always believed that the women of this state and the women of america would be a potent factor for good service and good results in political activities as they have always been potent fac tors for good results in all charities of the world and in the church of the world and in the homes of the world their passion for fair play and high ideals their motherly instincts for helping the weak and the unfortunate and the inenicient their bravery and resolution in times of peril con vince me that we shall look back in the future with great joy and pride to the occasion when we first welcomed women to equal political rights i can only say in passing that i hope the women and i believe the women will re gard this high privilege for which they have struggled so many years in vain with greater respect than we men have habitually regarded it when miss hay was reading the closing paragraphs of the platform a group of the picket party sitting in the gallery let down a banner over the railing containing the words senator wadsworth obstructs the freedom of women we demand his support for the national suffrage amendment or his resignation from the senate as soon as it was observed by the delegates pandemonium reigned and cries of put them out put them out tear it down were heard on every side chairman fassett ordered the banner taken down by the sergeant at arms the picketers held on to it while the convention continued to roar there being no sympathy manifested among the delegates for the interrupters the banner was eventually captured and peace restored miss hay stepping forward on the platform said that banner was not put there by the vot ing women of new york later when mrs baker of washington de nied the truth of this claim miss hay issued the following statement i understand that it is said i made an inac curate statement in claiming that the banner in question was not placed by the women voters of new york state a note was sent me on the platform after the incident closed to this effect it was of course impossible for me to reopen the discussion then i am told that several of the women connected with the incident are enrolled new york voters to this extent therefore my statements seem to have been inaccurate but the spirit of what i said remains true that this group of women is not representative of the women voters of new york state in fact the op position manifested by the whole assemblage to the banner justifies my own attitude through out the new york suffrage campaign in always opposing the militant tactics of the national woman’s party and also in the campaign for the federal suffrage amendement as unneces sary and undignilied tactics as a matter of historical fact few if any women belonging to the group known as the woman’s party assisted the great new york campaign while on the contrary several ob structed it the women presenting the banner were not known as women to whom any credit for the new york victory belongs as a matter of further fact the words on the banner represented a sentiment very gen erally felt by men and women in new york had senator wadsworth the nicety of feeling which one should expect in a gentleman he would either vote for the federal suffrage amendment so strongly demanded by his state or if his feelings forbid resign in order that representative government may proceed it has been made clear that he has no such under standing of his duty and has given no evidence that he intends to do other than continue to obstruct the will of his state no banner tactics can compel him to change his attitude and the psychology of such methods has the reverse effect a woman beaten by her husband complained bitterly to the neighbors one night they heard her cries as his blows fell upon her they flew to her defense but were much discomlited when the woman grabbed a chair and attacked her would be defenders she would not per mit them to thus insult her husband that is a story of simple everyday psychology in similar fashion republican men and women who hold exactly the views of the banner turned against the group of outstanders who attempted to attack the senator in public fashion many men said to the women dele gates we know senator wadsworth has not done right we cannot defend him and do not intend to try but we cannot stand by and see him insulted some tactics are psychologically right and some are psychologically wrong and this was an episode which helped not at all but put a bitter taste in many mouths there is little reason to suppose that rhyme or reason will alter the bigotry of the senator’s attitude the federal suffrage amendment will pass without him mrs wadsworth is reported by the press to have said to a picketer you will see if he senator wadsworth offers himself again for public service the anti suifragists will be in a majority both among men and women they will support a man who clings to principle rather than to bow to political expediency senator wadsworth’s wife has thrown down the gauntlet and thus announces that when and if he comes up for re election it will be a drawn battle between suffragists and anti suffragists it is doubtful if republicans will take the risk of nominating him but if they do new york at times has had a democratic senator it will upon that occasion have another the women of new

continued from page 169 the president of the united states is still nominated by convention though about half the states have presidential preference pri maries by means of which state delegates go to the national convention with a knowledge of the pe0ple’s preference for presidential can didate these are of little effectiveness how ever and in his message to congress in de cember 1913 president wilson recommended a general federal direct primary law this would bring federal nominations like federal campaigns under the control of the national government in about one third of the states delegates to the national convention are nominated at primaries the direct primary is a great improvement on the olsler system the main charge against it is a charge against the voter few voters come out at the primaries at the last gubernatorial election in new york the republican vote cast was almost three times as large as the vote cast at the republican primaries the reason for this is partly that the voter is not yet fully awakened to his responsibility but it is even more to be laid to the long ballot the long ballot is one of the great sources of the power of corrupt politics non partisan elections on local issues and candidates where national party issues have no bearing is one reform which has as yet made little headway but which would do much to undermine the corrupt power

sixty fifth senate n o suffragist should be downhearted because the vote long expected has not yet taken place the suffragists were in their seats and ready for the vote on thursday mr goff of west virginia in very ill health came on at great risk for the second time to vote for the amendment and other men made great sacrifices to be present the opposition realizing that the suffragists had the necessary votes to put the measure through indulged in the filibuster the tactics of the parliamentary high binder to prevent a vote being taken clearly in the hope that on some other day suffragists would be absent and thus give their side the advantage which it lacked on june 27 the country which has manifested a tremendous de mand for the passage of the amendment is in no mood to tolerate such obstruction methods of the minority political state conventions legislatures associations of every kind and description and a very large portion of the press have expressed an impatience because the senate has not passed the federal amendment many senators still obdurate have confessed that they have never received so many requests to vote for any other measure as for the federal amendment every day during the weary months which have intervened since the house vote was taken the senti ment has grown stronger the friends more determined the demand is still growing and will continue to grow the woman suffrage committee has promised a vote during this session and the minority cannot for ever prevent it meanwhile primaries are due in july and august and all the members of congress and one third of the senate come up for election these facts are naturally.in every man’s mind with more or less compelling force most of the senators want to get home to look after their fences and they are disappearing a few at a time for days or weeks a few will feel more like giv ingi attention to grave affairs of human progress when their own election with its many problems little and big are satisfactorily disposed of the senate at a distance looks invitingly attractive to many men and consequently in several states three or four candidates are striving for the shoes of the in cumbent in washington this creates a situation which tends to nerves it must be conceded that all the patriotic earnest men in the senate have worked very hard at the driving business of war legislation and the numerous absences from illness indicate that the senate is tired every man for these and other reasons seems pining for a re cess and therefore a recess there probably will be during the month of july that means that the vote may not come until august or even september hope deferred maketh the heart sick is an old and perhaps ordinarily applicable proverb but when the hope is that of suffragists for the courtesy of fair treatment which cometh not the fact maketh not the suffrage heart sick it waxeth hot the suffrage temper and stirreth up the suffrage blood ready for the next encounter in which the minority may withhold courtesy but the majority certainly wlll egitétirilzdegkc t 00816 c c c 106 the illions of suffragists all over the country watched m anxiously for reports from washington last thursday notice had been given that the federal amendment would be brought up on that day june 27th an effort had been made unsuccessfully to secure consent for a vote at a definite hour and there was other evidence that the opposition would attempt to accomplish by a filibuster what it was doubtful of bringing about by a count of votes the galleries were packed with women long before noon when the senate was called to order and they had come prepared to stay to the end however long delayed it was a bitter surprise to hundreds of them who had gathered from far and near to witness the victorious passage of the amendment to see instead a demonstration of as unreasoning and ugly hostility as the years of struggle have produced when consideration of the amendment was called senator un derwood of alabama on behalf of the opposition declared that no vote would be allowed on the amendment unless pairs were furnished for senator ollie james who was absent on account of illness by his absence the opposition lost one vote as the vote on the amendment requires a two thirds majority the pair ing of absentees has to be made on the basis of two for to one against y the demand of senator underwood therefore was that two senators present and desiring to vote should abstain from doing so thus taking two from the suffrage poll in order to give senator james absent and ill a vote on the anti side to this demand senator jones on behalf of the suffragists made reply upon this question i would be unwilling to pair with anybody under any circumstances and if i am unwilling to pair with anybody under any circumstances on this ques tion then i am unwilling to ask any of my colleagues in the senate to do a thing which i would not myself do that is the situation which confronts the senate i have no assurance nor is there any assurance that unless he returns he can ever obtain a pair from anybody and there is noth ing of hope held out to us that delay will aid in settling the question of a pair we have just as good hope of a pair now as we will have later if a senator today is unwilling to pair he will be unwilling tomorrow he will be unwilling next week and so far as that question is concerned we might just as well take the vote now the filibuster as the process of intervening speeches motions roll calls questions of privileges etc for the purpose of pre venting the proper order of business is called then began senator reed of missouri whose name is well known the world over and clear up to the foot of the german throne as the chief director of obstruction of war legislation in the united states took the floor assuming the pose of patriot he declared that suffragists were responsible for holding back the passage of the military appropriation bill then pending and in order to do his part toward preventing any business of any kind made a long speech chiefiy repeating familiar war talk known to every school child at the end of an hour and a quarter he was over the woman citizen day heard saying to a fellow member i can’t keep this up any longer whereupon another filibusterer took the floor the women in the galleries were forced to sit wearily through it but the senators on the fioor setting guards to report when he should quit talking took the opportunity of going to lunch a telegram received next day read missouri women’s only consolation is that they are not responsible for reed during the early part of the afternoon it was clear that senator lodge republican of massachusetts was the leader and gen eral hoor manager for the opposition but the loving comaraderie 6 between the wilful few republicans and the wilful few democrats who in normal relations do not waste time in each other’s company was an amazing sight to the galleries mr lodge of massachusetts mr ellison smith of south carolina mr brandegee of connecticut mr martin of virginia mr w’adsworth of new york mr underwood of alabama as divided as the kaiser and the king of england on most matters were as united as twin brothers in defending the nation against the awful disaster to the nation should women be enfranchised by federal amendment the congressional record prints for the most part what senators say but it cannot record the pictures of republicans and democrats with arms around each other’s necks with demo crats slapping republicans on the back in token of a copimon jubilation that they had scored a mighty victory in preventing the senate from taking a vote brave men they kept the boys in the trenches fighting for democracy abroad from the appro priation the war needed for a whole afternoon and the women fighting for democracy at home from their vote by a filibuster the front rows of one gallery were resplendent with well dressed well powdered well batted but anxious antis they demonstrated again their uses as allies of the suffragists for even mr brandegee who made a speech a few days before so vul gar in character as to shpck every listener was forced to curb his tongue to the limits of ordinary decency in remembrance of their presence after it had been made apparent that the opposition was willing to talk three weeks if need be and go to any lengths necessary to prevent a vote so long as the conditions predicted a victory for the amendment and as the opposition by so doing was really prevent ing the passage of a bill which the secretary of w'ar had de clared to be absolutely imperative senator jones who had charge of the suffrage bill therefore made the following announcement i want this joint resolution to pass i believe it will pass but it is evident from statements made here that if it is pressed now there will be great delay in its passage and in the passage of the supply bills therefore i am going to ask to withdraw the motion i have made and which is now pending to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolu tion with the understanding that after the supply bills are out of the way this matter will be again brought before the senate and will he kept before the senate in the face of any attempt to recess for the summer i make that request mr president the motion for conside atio w r ore withdrawn digitized by july 6 1918 the event of the afternoon was a speech by senator brandegee of connecticut there is nothing on this green earth which this gentleman hates like a suffragist he has re fused to receive deputations of connecticut women and has closed his mind to their appeals as well as his door in their faces it is as clear to him that men were divinely ordained to rule over women as it is clear to the kaiser that he is divinely ordained to rule over men yet even he recognizes the onward strides of the movement and spent little time in discussing the right or wrong of the measure this gentleman member of a party and representative of a state that went to war to determine that the sovereign rights of a state were not supreme prefaced his speech by having several letters read into the record from other re publicans and making the most abject appeal t‘o‘the south to stand by its old time tradition of states rights everett p wheeler republican familiar and professional opponent in characteristic style wrote this attempted compulsion of states opposed to political suffrage for women is not democratic it is german the germans were as confident of the excellence of their kultur as suffragists are of their dogma instead of attempting to convince other states they sought to compel that is what the suffragists are trying to do with maine massa chusetts new jersey pennsylvania ohio nebraska all of which have voted by large majorities against political suf frage for women no state and no people in the united states have voted against woman suffrage a majority of men have done so which means something between about a quarter and a half of the people a few briefs from mr brandegee’s speech may serve to define the nature of the opponents and the opposition mr president of course in my opinion the granting of suffrage to women will not make a better government and will not make better laws for this country i may be totally mistaken about that of course it will double the number of voters and double the expense and a lady has got to vote either against her husband or with him if she votes with him the result will be the same and if she votes against him the result will be the same and if she does not vote at all the result will be just the same as it is now and i cannot perceive how the thing is going to purify politics very much mr shafroth does not the senator believe that the just powers of government are derived from the consent of the governed mr brandegee what does the senator believe about the philippine islands mr shafroth i must say that i have always been in favor of giving independence to the philippine islands and fought upon the floor of the senate for that very principle mr brandegee mr president all this talk about strik ing the manacles and the shackles off the limbs of the en slaved women of this country is perfect tommy rot laugh ter that is all there is to it mr shafroth if we are not to recognize that funda mental principle of government which is the foundation stone of our republic what are we fighting for over in europe mr brandegee i think to make the world safe for the democratic party laughter mr shafroth the senator will find it is making it 107 safer for democracy and you cannot make it safer for democracy if you refuse to extend this privilege to women mr brandegee that argument does not convince me mr president mr owen mr president the term privilege seems now to be accepted as the proper vernacular in dealing with this right of suffrage but i think that the senator is not justified in calling it a privilege because if there is a moral right it is for a human being who is of age to have a voice in the government by which his life and liberties are con trolled mr brandegee mr president this question of moral rights is beyond me anybody can evolve out of his inner consciousness what he says is a moral right and maintain it and there is no way of disputing it or arguing about it i do not consider it a question of morals at all as to the qualifications of electors i consider‘it a practical matter to be judged by practical men as to what they think will be the best form of government for the people of the country all this lingo about the women of america being enslaved is pure trumpery and foolishness you cannot get on a trol ley car without having to take off your hat and give up your seat to every woman who gets aboard the car and they are petted and flattered and well i will not say what else is done with them laughter in the galleries but they are the queen bees in this country and there is no nation in the world where a woman’s lot is so happy as it is in this country mr shafroth mr president i should like to ask the senator if men were deprived of the right of suffrage whether or not he would consider it of the character he has described mr brandegee i do not think the men are going to deprive themselves of a function which they have always exercised mr shafroth but as a matter of fact the people re gard the deprivation of the right to vote as slavery mr brandegee i do not admit that it is a right at all mr shafroth the senator does not consider it a right mr brandegee i do not i deny it absolutely mr shafroth if it were taken away from the senator i am inclined to think he would think it was a great right mr brandegee i would not object or if i did object i would be powerless if the legislature of my state should decide that bachelors could not vote i would think that it was wrong but i would submit to it i say if three quarters of the legislatures of the states do approve of this thing if it is passed up to them by congress thinking it necessary then suppose it does not work in the states suppose some states do not like it and the results are bad what have they got to do they are absolutely foreclosed for all time what becomes of your majority rule there may be a dozen states that think this thing is a failure and is working ruin upon them they have got to start an agitation for a constitutional amend ment to undo that constitutional amendmenthand they have got to convince two thirds of the senate two thirds of the house and three quarters of the legislatures of all the states of the union to put it out of the constitution mr president the mere suggestion of that shows as senator elihu root said in that letter i put into the record that it is perilous to use the constitution of the united states to regulate the daily habits of the people and their domestic concerns digitized by 0 page 108 10 5 the woman citizen thus ended the day continued from page 107 is it so that the party which has for seventy five years stood for the doctrine announced by its sainted leader that that gov ernment governs best which governs least is here today to say that their own states and their own people have abandoned any idea of govern ing themselves and are now prepared to turn that function over to washington mr president what sort of government are we going to have when we get through with this ghost dance we are now indulging in ex senator root foresees it and forecasts it the new york world foresees it and fore casts it a good many democrats see it and forecast it but they decline to stand up and try to prevent it when i say democrats i am not refiecting on them a good many republicans are doing the same thing i simply instance democrats because these things appear to me to be more in violation of the things that they have heretofore stood for and proclaimed should be fundamental enator lewis of illinois sounded out the point signified the states rights opponents contend that the amendment will allow the federal government to dictate the qualifications for voters which of course has no foundation mr lewis mr president will the senator from connecticut give me his opin ion as to a viewpoint expressed through the article tendered by him it is this has the senator from connecticut any legal doubt but that the power in the state of connecticut would still remain to prescribe qualifications and conditions under which suffrage could be exercised under this amendment to the same extent as they do now and as they have for the past ten years mr brandegee i have no doubt about it it would utterly deprive the state of the power to determine the qualifications of its own electors mr lewis nell which viewpoint does the senator have mr brandegee i have the viewpoint that if the constitution of the united states says that the state of connecticut can not prescribe the qualifications of its own electors it can not do so mr lewis then i fear i did not make myself clear to the senator i meant to ask the senator does he feel that this amend ment when adopted would in any wise take from the state of connecticut the same power to regulate by conditions and qualifi cations the enjoyment of the suffrage to the same extent that it has done heretofore un der state law mr brandegee i do not know whether it is an enjoyment or not but i think it would absolutely deprive the state of the right to limit the suffrage to males laughton mr lewis the senator of course un derstands i recognize that it removes the limitation of sex but as to conditions and qualifications in the enjoyment such as edu cation such as protection of the ballot at the hands of those who should be enlight n the same week that the united states postponed action on the political liberty of american women a pledge was given that this government would stand unequivocally for the complete liberation of all branches of the slavic racc ened enough to exercise it does the senator feel that this amendment in any wise would interfere with that indicated in the paper presented by him mr brandegee my opinion is of course that a state at present has the right to confine the suffrage to the male sex if it chooses to do so but if this amendment is passed it can not do it mr lewis yes i concur with the senator9 if this amendment is passed mr brandegee as to any other quali fication this amendment of course does not touch them at all senator williams of mississippi offered an amendment to insert the word white before women that amendment was not discussed and will come up when the amendment does and thus ended the day on which side 0 n which side does the united states government stand on the subject of woman suffrage beside her ally great britain or beside her teutonic foe are we huns or are we blood brothers of england in the world fight for democracy the eyes of the whole world are turned toward the united states senate to them will belong the splendid honor of deciding the question to the everlasting credit of the united states or the

legislatures the amendment to our federal constitution provid ing for woman suffrage the house passed this reselution january 10 of this year by the required majority the senate committee ap proved the same resolution last september 10 yet this august body is not quite majority sure whether it would be proper for it to send the amendment along to the states the old argument that the initiative in this matter should be taken by the states is absurd must the federal government wait upon the states initiative as to whether as a nation we shall do the best and the right thing for our citizens and our country the congressional body that most closely reflects popular feeling has said submit the amendment let the upper house follow suit if we await the states initiative and if it might be possible for one state per year to extend full franchise to its woman citizens which has been the rate the past seven years it will be 36 years before the women in all our states can have a voice in public admin istration with the federal amendment sub mitted at once three fourths of the states will soon decide the question a great many new phases of public administration are bound to develop in the next few years due to the abnormal conditions through which we are pass ing phases in which the welfare of our women will vitally affect the welfare of the nation and it will be unwise and unseemly for the united states generally to be in such an electoral status that it can not have the advantage of its women citizens decisions rendered in the most effective simple and dignified way

who in past years have opposed it in view of these changed conditions and in light of the social and economic problems which are certain to follow in the wake of the war and which we believe can be

before congress t the annual meeting of the montgomery county federation of nomen’s clubs held may 17 a resolution endorsing woman’s suffrage was passed by a large majority this county federation is composed of twenty eight clubs including the social service league which has many men members the resolu tion was introduced by mrs jessie ross thom son state president as well as montgomery county president of the woman’s suffrage league it is an interesting coincidence that the montgomery county federation should be the first in the state to endorse woman’s suf frage and that the meeting at which it was done was held in the old friends meeting house at sandy springfwhere the society of friends organized many years ago the first equal suffrage association in maryland think of it americans

seneca lake and the wonderful hills beyond for background the day was perfect and should have made the convention a glad mem ory in the mind of every attendant however other conventions have had perfect days and beautiful settings but that of ontario county recorded an incident which will never occur in any other county convention it was attended by the last survivor of the famous convention of 1848 miss rhoda palmer now aged 102 years she sat on mrs lewis hospitable porch throughout the convention looking as the delegates said rosy and good for many years to come but her one aim now is to live until november 6 when she will have the joy of casting her first vote she brought with her for exhibition one of those hand woven blue and white bed spreads for which she had carded and spun the wool and had woven it herself some seventy five or eighty years ago think of it americans for seventy years she has longed for the vote doing what she could to secure it for herself and her sex

suf frage association is taking in both lines of work indeed to them it is all one work for the kansas sulfragists see the passage of the federal suffrage amendment and the enfran chisement of all the women of thecountry as a part of the world’s fight for democracy the address of the president mrs brooks was devoted to the status of the amendment and an aggressive program to gain the two votes needed in the senate was voted by the assembled women kansas like the other suf frage states is keen to be one of the first to ratify the amendmentwhen it is passed the convention brought together women of the state who had fought for the political free dom of kansas women thirty years ago and women who were converts to suffrage not more than four years ago when kansas won her full political freedom in an address of welcome mrs w a johnston of topeka honorary presi dent of the state association reviewed some of the changes in woman’s political status during the past thirty years mrs w y

political home defense which disfranchised for the period of the war certain religious objectors and all men naturalized since 1902 it also enfranchised wives widows mothers daugh ters and sisters of soldiers or nurses who have served or will serve in canadian or british military service it thus put out of politics its possible unpatriotic citi zens and brought in its patriotic citizens the bill gave dissatisfaction as unjust to patriotic women who might not be included in the act therefore sir robert borden announced that were he returned as premier he would correct the discrimi nation against such women by sponsoring a wider sufrage for women he was returned and on march zist introduced a bill extending the vote to all women who are british citizens of the age of 21 subject only to the respective qualilications of the several provinces this bill passed both houses of the dominion parlia ment received the royal assent on may 23rd and thus the women of canada from ocean to ocean

truly spanish it was the capitulation of spanish men students to spanish girl students the gallant caballero whose object in life had been to make love to sefwriras with roses in their hair suddenly dis covered something finer than noses they saw these girls as classmates with ambitions just like their own for some years girls had been carrying off university honors and putting the men to the blush and at first men were dis concerted one day two girls raquel alonso and marina rodriquez studying for the degree in pharmacy were met at the door of the uni versity as they were leaving morning exercises with their teacher nearly four hundred stu dents formed in double line a royal escort on both sides of the street the royal march was struck up and books canes coats and even bats were thrown down for the seiioritas to walk on with characteristic dash and im petuosity says the recorder of this incident the young men stopped the street cars and also foot passengers yes everything must wait while the girls with their escort passed here was a street parade in the interests of woman’s progress that preceded by many years the long processions in the united states all honor to the spanish pioneers these two girls had studied successfully for four years chiefiy in the sciences and mathematics although profes sors in those departments had at first opposed the entrance of women into their classes he spanish have an educational title on all fours with the magna cum laude of the english universities except that it has a virility which is all its own the spanish mark of highest attainment in scholarship is sobrrsalientc leaping over everything the story of two spanish girls taught by an ameri can woman who broke the traditions of the university of madrid and got sobresaliente in every examination is an old story but as told with gusto in a comparatively new book the life of alice gordon gulick by her sister elizabeth putnam gulick it brings to a front place in literature the whole picturesque story of the spanish woman of the twentieth cen tury the regeneration of spain must begin with the education of women was a sentence in a spanish newspaper written twenty two years ago when four spanish girls received the de gree of bachelor of arts from the govern ment institute of guipuzcoa at san sebastian on the northern coast of spain this was the first time such a degree had ever in the his tory of spain been conferred upon women taught by women the teacher was the ameri can mrs gulick who had opened an institute for the higher education of women in spain and did not stop until she had succeeded in matriculating her girls into the university of madrid in 1895 mrs gulick secured from the uni versity a privilege never before granted that of preparing her own pupils and sending them p m madrid such an idea was wholly with out precedent although there still hangs in the university of madrid a portrait of a noble lady who first won the doctor's decree in the liberal arts more than a century ago 13 tween 1872 and 1892 that is during twenty years one hundred and sixty young women had matriculated in the university but the course had been finished by only eighteen and they were cared for by the spanish professors when after long debate upon the subject it was decided to accept the two girls from mrs gulick’s institute not only were they on trial but the efi‘icacy of women teachers was also on trial in every examination these two young women students got sobresaliente each of the girls received in 1897 with honor the degree of philosophy and letters corresponding to m a and the highest possible marks in the university the tribunal examining the girls for that year were three of spain’s most noted men who gave them with a third woman stu dent the distinction of the three notables of the year en seem to have accepted women in spain when once the initial step was taken with a better grace than in some other countries an extraordinary young woman graduate from mrs gulick's institute wrote for the leading papers in seville a series of articles on the women of america england germany and china the articles were well written and attracted much attention the last one was signed with her name and when it appeared the writer was immediately invited by the lib eral club of seville the largest club of men in the city to give them an address on spanish women when she appeared on the platform there was such prolonged applause that it was several minutes before she could speak no longer ago than the publication of his castilian days john hay characterized the spanish women as kept in systematic ignor ance although conceding that they have a quicker and more active intelligence than the men with a fair degree of education he declared much might be hoped from them in the intellectual development of the country examples of such leaders of the intellectual development of spain are many professor katherine coman gives an account of one of spain’s great nineteenth century women con cepcion arenal 1820 1892 dona concepcion was a sociologist and contributed the chapters on spanish prisons to dr wines’s the state of prisons and also wrote for stanton’s w'omen of europe in deference to conser vative spanish ideas dona concepcion offered her first essay in the name of her own ten year old son her paper on the abandon ment of children was read in this country at the conference of charities and corrections in 1884 some of her ideas were very modern her treatises the voman and home the education of women the woman of the future ring with stirring appeals for free dom and opportunity it is a grave error she said and one of the most prejudicial to im press upon a woman that her sole mission is that of wife and mother vhether sin gle or married or widowed she has duties to perform rights to reclaim a dignity that is de pendent upou no one but herself a work of her own to carry into execution at the international council of vomen in europe a few years ago one of the most striking women present was senora emtbifgitiigarwi the woman citizen women of spain pardo bazan spain has an honorable record in intellectual women but senora pardo bazan is probably the leading living feminist the author of a series of books on women and of many psychological novels though denied the right of being elected to the spanish acad emy of letters because she is a woman she has been requested by the government of spain to serve in the department of education and in 1916 was invited to fill a chair in the university of madrid enora pardo bazan belongs to the north of spain the biscayan sections where there has been a great literary impetus within the last quarter of a century a literary move ment full of vigor originality and charm yet only slightly known to the english reading world more than another the instigator of this initial move towards the revival of the virile humorous picturesque and picaresque novel of spain was fernan caballero a woman of german descent but of spanish enthusiasms the american woman mrs gulick who helped on the cause of woman's education in spain was the intimate friend of such women as alice freeman palmer of katherine lee bates of professor katherine coman and tle sister of miss anna gordon the present head of the woman’s christian temperance union to those who think of reconstruction as a phase of the present war only it may be in teresting to point out an altruistic effort led by the government of the united states and the friends of education at the time of the spanish american nar this was an educa tional and humanitarian effort on a large scale an effort not only to care for the spanish prisoners in a humane manner but also to edu cate cuban youth for the entire summer of 1898 mrs gulick who was then in america was employed with her daughters in interpreting and ministering to the 1600 cuban men who were prisoners of war on seavey's island in the piscataqua in 1900 she was in cambridge living in the house of alice freeman palmer as dean of the school for cuban youths which was carried on under the auspices of harvard university

pre sented the following remarkable petition to lord chelmsford viceroy and governor general of india and the right honourable e s montagu m p his majesty’s secretary of state for india may it please your excellency right honourable sir on behalf of the women of india we wel come you to our land sir and thank you for coming to investigate the position of affairs at first hand and to consult about pos sible changes with representatives of our people we beg you to accept our most sincere thanks for receiving us today in the midst of your crowded programme of engagements we have asked for a portion of your valu able time because the women of india have awakened to their responsibilities in the public life and have their own independent opinions about the reforms that are necessary for the progress of india many organizations have been started by and for women during the past ten years of which we have representatives here such as the indian w omen’s associations the seva sadan the mahila seva samaja the indian women's university the w'omen's home rule league branches etc vve‘are in touch with the new outlook of indian women and we make hold at this historic time to lay before you vvomen’s views concerning the necessary post war reforms as we believe them to be the necessary complement to the views of our men i the women of india understand and support the broad claims of their people for self gov ernment within the empire and they press for its bestowal as urgently as do their brothers they have in large numbers signed the petition organized by mr gandhi in favour of the scheme of reform drawn up by the national cui‘igi‘css and the muslim league they have also held large ladies meetings taken part in processions and public meetings and in many ways worked towards obtaining the measure of self government suggested in this scheme and in the non otiicial memorandum of the nineteen members of the imperial legislative council with the general terms of both of which they through us wish you to know that they are in agreement our interests as one half of the people are directly affected by the demand in the united scheme 1.3 that the members of the coun cil should be elected direct by the people on as broad a'franchise as possible and in the lemorandum 3 that the franchise should be broadened and extended directly to the peo ple vv'e pray that when such a franchise is being drawn up women may be recognized as people and that it may be worded in such terms as will not disqualify our sex but allow our women the same opportunities of repre sentation as our men in agreeing with the demand of the above mentioned memorandum that a full measure of local self government bould be immediately granted we request that it shall include the representation of our women a policy that has been admittedly suc cessful for the past twenty years in local self im'ernments elsewhere in the british empire e'w'wf rnn dr gurabai kamarkar of bombay india dr kamarkar is a member of the na tional board of the y ll c a in india and has just been in this country for an interna tional h’ar work council she is a graduate physician and is going back to do medical work among the women of her native country it may not be generally knpwn that women of india have been called upon to give much time to war work just as have other women in the allied cause since the war began india has sent 1,100.000 of her sons according to dr kamarkar mymountry has also contributed gold by the ton spices and grain she informed a reporter we how even sent fire wood and charcoal to ll’iesopotamia where they had only palm leaves for fuel princes have given their personal ornaments and many of the rajahs have gone to the war within the first four months the women had organized red cross classes throughout the country and were mak ing great quantities of the garments needed as their men began to embark for foreign countries a feeling of international friendship was engendered among them for the women of other countries whose men were also at the front in india we are t'ery anxious for home rule she continued but when england de clared war the chief spokesman in congress urged his countrymen to put aside all diderences for the moment and to unite in helping great britain and at the various war fronts are brahman indian christian mar iota sikh and gursha regiments but while the women of east india are doing their part in war work yet they are not taking the places in industry left z'tlt‘dtti by the men as is the case in other countries there are a number of them employed in mills but none in shops on cars or occupying other public positions 1 few of the women enter professions 113 of our allies the women of india the precedent for including women in modern indian political life has been a marked feature of the indian national congress in which since its inception women have voted and been dele gates and speakers and which this yearlinds its climax in the election of a woman as its presi dent thus the voice of india approves of its women being considered responsible and acknowledged citizens and we urgently claim that in the drawing up of all provisions re garding representation our sex shall not be made a disqualification for the exercise of the franchise or for service in public life in order to fit ourselves and our children for future public responsibilities arising out of the foregoing considerations it is absolutely essen tial that our educational system should be reformed at present only one girl out of every hundred and only thirteen boys out of every hundred are educated mr gokhale recorded that only one out of every six indian villages possessed a school all our young people are clamouring for knowledge and the few schools we have are overcrowded we bring the urgent necessity for immediate action in educational matters before you now because the granting of facilities for education is a section of indian administration definitely under the control of the imperial legislative council and the gov ernment of india and it must be made as far as possible a uniform policy throughout all british india e therefore ask 1 that the government shall make a pronouncement in favor of compulsory and free primary education for boys and girls and widely extended secondary education and immediately set to work to bring this into being area by area as is being done in several of the indian states 2 we ask that during the time elapsing before the completion of this reform the government shall immedi ately devote as much attention to the education of girls as is now given by them to boys and provide an equal number of school facilities for them and thus remove the unwise differentia tion which provides facilities for ten times as many boys as girls a policy which defeats its own ends as the uneducated wives of these boys later hold back their progress in order to supply teachers for this wide spread of education we ask the government to provide a largely increased number of train ing colleges for indian women teachers and also to establish a‘number of vidows homes for this purpose supplemented by the grant of scholarships to widows and those anxious to be trained as teachers several traveling scholar ships should also be granted for specially prom ising teachers ne suggest that a system of grants should also be made to assist associa tions which are now so widely attempting to continue the education of married women out side of ordinary school hours and curricula as a better physical standard is also an es sential of indian progress it is necessary to have educational means by which to cope with the disastrously high rate of infant mortality and the high death rate of young married continued on page 118 114 dr sea grave rs raymond brown is back from france this piece of news held front place this week with the news from vashington for mrs brown is back from her visit to

woman suffrage associa tion and the central committee of the hospitals mrs brown spoke with enthusiasm of the splendid work being done by all the national’s units at the front she has returned to select a largely increased personnel for the civilian unit and to organize an entirely new unit whose location is not yet designated we shall need many new workers said mrs brown and it is imperative that we have the very best possible women we shall need doctors nurses aids and chauffeurs who have attained excellence in their professions it is not necessary to demand that they shall be fearless in danger for every woman over there is ready to go to the hardest post what is harder to bear than danger is the patient endurance of enforced idleness which is liable to happen to every one women who apply should be physically strong between the ages of 25 and 50 without near relatives in the army and should under stand some french above all they should go out in the spirit of enlisted men

cared for in barracks erected in the mayor’s own grounds in this section few french doctors are left to care for the civilian population and the access of hundreds of refugees presents an overwhelming problem when the unit went to southern france there was one doctor for the civilian needs of the five towns in their immediate section now there is not even one and american women of the laboulieyre unit are working up to their limit for the civilian population as well as for the refugees allotted to their care one of the two new units assigned to the vomen’s oversea hospitals u s a is to be an extension of that at labouheyre there are many stories told of the pathetic gratitude of french women for the medical care they have needed so long but which they have lacked because of the exigencies of war in some cases where operations are necessary they must be deferred until patients are the woman citizen a message from the hospitals hen dr seagravc was asked what the war would do for the woman doctor she thought it might help the eastern professional women a great deal but laughineg explained that the western woman needs no help thank you dr seagravc is of the woman voting west she was born in cheyenne w'yoming the oldest voting state and is professionally anchored in farthest west seattle where great shipping yards are flinging out almost daily the new american argosy she is used to seeing big things done speedily and by men and women together without sex discrimination the mansion of the mayor of labouheyre l whose pheasant park is the first refugee unit of the women's uversea hospitals u s a suhiciently built up to undergo the strain one of the unwritten heroisms of the war will be that of women doctors splendidly equipped such surgeons as dr seagravc and dr alice gregory who are just as keen as are men surgeons to gain the added technique of military hospital experience yet who for humanity’s sake are laying aside all personal wishes to serve civilians and refugees there will be a wonderful advance in surgical knowledge through the enforced opera tions made necessary by unusual wounds said dr seagravc in an interview before her de parture just to see such cavities opened up will give the surgeon a chance to demonstrate things which have heretofore been more or less experimental experience gained now is going to make it possible to introduce great alleviations of suffering to the race military surgery in france today is of the greatest educational value and an opportunity all surgeons must covet yet for all this dr seagravc is going to a

at a canteen somewhere in france it is from a good suffragist college graduate and artist who had made a record for herself as the director of the trenton n j museum of fine arts before america went into the war when the call came for recruits she could not see why she should not give her youth and strength in active service as her brothers are giving theirs she is now serving a canteen under the y m c a among enlisted men she constantly speaks of her gratification at being placed among the privates instead of the officers editor’s note his is about my third attempt at writing this letter time is an unheard of luxury over here i sent off just a note to you this morning to tell you that i was still alive in spite of all evidence to the contrary the real reason why i haven’t had time to write my own mother this week is because of other peoples mothers sunday is mother’s day and all mail written on or before that day and marked mother’s mail will be sent to america by express as it were so we’re putting up post ers and a mother’s_ day bulletin board with pic tures of moth rs and verses and anecdotes about them and you’d be surprised to see how the men hang around that board and copy the verses the letters are just coming in in piles i'm going to send this letter through that way and see if it reaches you any more quickly i wish you could have seen the canteen on sunday it is always our busiest day as the men have more time then and besides it was rainy so the canteen was packed i wrote you a note sunday morning telling you that i was giving every man a white flower on mother’s day i wish you could have heard the nice things that they said i had to ransack all the say just a word or two to everybody mother’s day with pershing’s crusaders by helen perry greenhouses and gardens in town and suppose that i must have given out as many as two thousand white flowers most of them were daisies as no carnations are to be had here we tried to pin most of them on ourselves and and i wish you could have seen how pleased they were one of them said it was worth coming all the way to france for that day we couldn’t keep enough writing paper to supply the men and i’m sure the censors will be entirely snowed under one man consulted me about whether it would be entirely proper to write to his girl’s mother on that day as well as his own many told us they had no mothers and others wanted to tell us all about them we each ought to be triplets the morning service was in honor of our mothers and the room was packed i just wish i’d had a real mother here to show those men ve each have one day off a week and this week i spent a part of it in fixing up our room removing the brass angels and paper flowers and replacing them with brass candlesticks a plant or two our own books chintz covers for the pillows a home made lampshade and some of our own pictures and photographs we want it to look like a little bit of america when the men come to see us we have turned the bed in the downstairs room into a couch so it is really a very pretty little living room we hope to be able gradually to invite a few men here at a time and in that way reach men that we would not be able to reach in any other way its pathetic how much they want to talk about american things and eat american food and have a real american good time a man came into the canteen to day who said my if you were up our way at the front you’d have sixteen hundred slaves some of us up there haven’t seen a woman for months we’re beginning now to try and have the men help us do things around the canteen in the way of little dabs of painting repairs putting up stage decorations etc you see lots of them stationed here have nothing much to do and love to putter around helping incidentally it helps to get things done in a country where carpenters and painters etc may come to mor row or next week or next month i have never felt so old in my life the things these men tell us and want advice about if i were a hundred years old i could never be wise enough to tell them they tell us glad things and sad things and all their worries and all their happinesses we have seen pictures and read love letters and talked with them about everything under the sun sometimes we want to cry and sometimes to laugh and always what they tell us seems sacred because it is what they would so much like to be saying to some other woman it’s just that they have to tell somebody as often as we can we bring men in for a little while in the evening and have candle light and an open fire and some thing american to eat when you have lived in a barracks for months without any of the niceties of life and have eaten from an army mess kit that means more than almost anything else one of the men who was in the other night told one of the secretaries when he got back gee we had an open fire and i sat in a big chair and stretched out my legs and the girls sat there and sewed or something and it was just like home

woman citizen for vigilance committees women on both sides of the sea are guarding as never before the lives and health of women and children hen the family’s dirty linen is washed in public what happens formerly this was modestly washed in the privacy of the family wash tub at present nearly as extinct as the dodo the family wash is now done collectively in one of the following places shirt and collar laundries agencies family bundle or hat work laundries or the most modern of all in the wet wash laundry but wherever it is done publicly the family’s dirty linen goes through at least ten pairs of hands before it comes back as clean blouses shining damask fresh handkerchiefs dainty lingerie is it so dainty and so fresh after all and what in its turn has it done on its way from dirt to purity toward contaminating the public these are questions which those guardians of the public the new york city department of health and the consumers league of the city of new york have undertaken to answer in a joint study of laundry conditions the c as of clean clothes in terms of health the supervisor of this investigation made in the fall of 1916 was dr louis j harris now director of the bureau of preventable diseases new york city department of health dr anna e ray robinson of the division of industrial hygiene made the neces sary examinations and the consumers league co operated in investigating social conditions of laundry workers the report covers forty two steam laundries in new york city with 3,024 employes of whom 715 were men and 2,309 women from one fifth to one quarter of all the workers in this industry in manhattan and brooklyn the first and last handlers of clothe s washed in public laundries and returned to homes are markers and sorters they turn over soiled garments marking when necessary and often by hand such articles as infected handkerchiefs collars worn by diseased people these people ceme in closest contact with the wearers if the clothes are in the least infected they suffer if the workers are infection carriers the clothes suffer if mothers know that babies nighties come home handled by those in acute stages of tuberculosis or suffering with trachoma what can they do about it very little individually very much collectively through their colleagues the public health officials out of thirty seven sorters examined in this public health official inspection 13.5 per cent had active tuberculosis besides one suspected case throat or nose troubles were found in 84 per cent of the markers examined 20 per cent had eye troubles two cases of typhoid fever one of diphtheria and two of trachoma had developed in this group as a direct result of their work in the forty two laundries seen facilities for washing the hands of the work ers were found to be insufficient and incon veniently located in no instances were gloves worn and soiled linen was thrown about care lessly as the same sorters who have handled the soiled clothes are frequently those who finally assemble the garments to be returned it is quite evident that the way of real clean liness public and domestic lies only in intelli gent co operation between home and laundry the laundry study brochure shows'the effects upon the workers of bad conditions such as dust from soiled garments wet hoors steaming heat and badly ventilated rooms one of the worst effects of laundry work upon women comes from long hours of stand ing and from working treadle pressing machines all day some of these presses are so con structh that it is necessary for the weight of the operator's body to hold the treadle in place throughout the ironing operation this treadle is often as high as 13 inches above the door and the body weight must be lifted to this height each time the machine is operated the treadle moves with a jerky motion often run ning as high as eighty one operations a minute only muscularly strong women can bear it out of forty six married women at this work questioned by examiners nineteen had under gone miscarriages i the survey shows also that laundry workers are very generally paid below the wage scale necessary for decent living four fifths of the women receiving less than 10 a week some of the shakers receive as little as 4.50 it naturally follows as the survey points out that the low pay attracts workers whose living con ditions are poor setting up a vicious circle of unwholesomencss from crowded unvcntilated homes must be drawn the workers who touch and handle gar ments which are to go back into clean homes and the reverse of the picture is that those already low in vitality from bad living condi tions are forced to work in daily contact with the unwashen garments of infected persons it needs collective efforts of householders as well as collective efforts of laundry workers to bring about desired remedies for such con ditions against pauper wages ncreased cost of living has brought the teachers salary problem to the front and the teachers salary problem is pre eminently a women’s salary problem as four fifths of the teachers in the united states are women teacher’s wages says the charlotte ob server commenting on conditions in north carolina are pauper wages this feeling is shared by the missouri teachers conference which found the miners of that state getting more than three times the pay of its teachers and by the district of columbia grade teachers union which found federal employees doing unskilled and unlettered work with a higher rate of wages than teachers a nation wide drive for higher salaries is planned by the national education association which is asking the co operation of women’s clubs the situation is summed up in these words by dr joseph swain chairman of the national education association digitized by 600816 present salaries will not meet the ever in creasing cost of living teachers are leaving their schoolrooms by the thousands they are taking up war work or entering industrial occupations their places are being filled if at all by unprepared and inexperienced recruits only our best efforts can maintain present standards our children need the best the country can provide democracy must have enlightened civiliza tion through education already the federal bureau of education is calling for more teachers during the war is asking married teachers formerly

democracy that saves to the editor of the woman citizen myself am a german born woman from berlin of course now a full fledged vot ing citizen who came to this country eight years ago to marry an american after i had lived in america for four years i became a suffragist the american suffrage move ment has given me so much in fact it has made me chiefiy through it i became familiar with the laws and principal traditions of this country i still remember the thrill which i felt back in 1914 when i looked up in the dictionary the meaning of amendment to the state constitution and not entirely sat isfied with the explanation of my american husband procured books to find out all about it for myself i‘do not need so many books any more to gain knowledge about the fed eral amendment i have learned a great deal since 1914 and i am looking for the passage of the federal amendment by the senate with anxious concern it will mean so much to the women of america and of the world i have great admiration for the american suttragist her foresightedness her efficiency her progressive spirit for co operation and comradeship which i saw in the 1915 and 1917 campaigns in new jersey and new york in this wartorn time that has produced and is producing such a sinister and fateful psy chology of hatred and distrust the american oman suffrage movement was like an oasis for me that gave me great mental consolation and comfort and at the same time a much better understanding of things and events and is it only a vision when i am hoping that the sutfragists of this country may help the german women over on that other side to throw off with the assistance of the men who will be left that tyrannical antiquated gov ernment and therewith save humanity the modern german woman who before the war had already greatly progressed from the kinder kuche und kirche type to a self thinking and self acting individual personality must have developed through these years of war a heroism and courage which would be well worth while to kindle and stimulate to deeds fatal to the present impossible form of government only through a manifestation of this char acter can the recently spoken words of presi dent vvilson the full and sincere democratic reconstruction of the world will not have been completely or adequately attained until women are admitted to the suffrage ever become a living truth a tribute of tears paris 1918 irst of all let me tell you how touched i was by the reception made by the ameri can red cross to the french charitable societies which i represented yesterday in this large house it seemed to me that i was surrounded pressed overwhelmed by a mil lion of thoughts which come from your great country toward our sweet france that has undergone so much during these cruel years of war i saw a vision of america bending over our sufferings listening to them in order to al leviate them and giving to that end millions of money and human lives and i can offer you no other tribute of my personal gratitude which is but a tiny portion of that of france than my tears which blur my eyes while i write you these lines tears of suffering pity gratitude and also of pride that france has deserved such friends this tribute i convey to you as an american woman come to comfort us in the name of your country signed madame h compel treasurer of the abri an ozark pilgrimage to the editor or the vvoman citizen number of persons from a distance have written within the past year or two wish ing to know how i have progressed with the horse back campaign for suffrage that i was talking about two or three years ago i think each and every inquirer is a reader of the i'voman citizen and this letter will tell them that it became a wonderful seality and pros pered even beyond my most sanguine expec tations my series of stories in the sunday magazine of the st louis post dispatch has kept a number of people informed of much of my interesting and novel experience but of course there are a few benighted persons in the world who do not read the st louis papers my experience these past two years has taught me that what seems calamity may prove to be the key to an interesting and worth while situation when i was suddenly plucked up root and branch from intense work in the city suffrage organization of my home town st louis and compelled to come to live for an indefinite time in the backwoods of the missouri ozarks because of the physical condition of my husband well it seemed even aside from the sorrow of illness nothing short of a calamity but i have traveled many miles on the back of my saddle horse la belle and i have converted men to suffrage that has been my specialty converting men i want men to be so eager to have their women folk vote that they are not going to invent excuses to leave women at home on election day after they shall have become voters something men could and would do holding as they always have held the balance of power in their hands perhaps nowhere in civilization are women so subject to their lords and masters as among the settlers and small farmers of the hill districts the more i see of the everydays down in these woods where one has perhaps more leisure to see and think than in the city the more i am convinced of the need for workers in the far corners of the earth and the more worth while i know these corners to be this summer i have combined junior red cross organization with my other duties mak ing the sunday school a base for operations and scarcely a sunday passes that i do not make a red cross speech and organize a tine junior league in some out of the way backwoods sun day school leaving one of my pupils in charge of my own sunday school class in my own little cross roads church for one of my privileges has been to gather together the young people each sunday morning and teach them ethics into these junior red cross organizations i put both mother and daughter for the summer’s work then when the autumn school begins the teacher will find a class of youngsters already imbued with the red cross spirit and qualified to help carry on the work from the center to which it properly belongs the public school leaving the mothers and aunts enthused to take up the more advanced red cross service of course i do not fail whether making liberty bond or red cross speeches to get in something always for suffrage and the fact that a woman who wants to vote is also eager to make gunwipes and knit socks for the soldiers has its effect on the n‘atives who have prided themselves on being sot in their opinions alice curtice moyer w 1n6 do you know this flour philadelphia pa june 16 1918 to the editor of the woman citizen ast fall you published the name and address

q a the woman citizen the woman’s journal a journal of democracy june 1 1918 w 0 shall fight for the thing which we have almays carried nearest our hearts for democracy for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government the woman and the calling merica is watching what dr anna howard shaw calls an inspiring spectacle the mobiliza tion of its women into the nation’s service no less to women than to men does the call of the country’s need bring a thrill the government is calling for women in every bulle tin issued from washington but before bulletins were issued something stronger than governments had iml pelled women to offer themselves all the tides of loyalty were rolling them forward into an army one and indivisible which is to save america it does not matter that some of this american army will be over here and some over there that some of it will be made up of men and some of women its soli darity is a wall to protect the cherished principles of american democracy more and more as the war program progresses says the united states civil service commission is the government depending upon women to perform the tremendously increased volume of work in the civil branches as men are called to the colors women must take their places and keep the machinery behind the armed forces moving at the maximum of efficiency now a new call for men has gone out and women are slipping one by one into their places over night one finds them in the elevators of office buildings in the sur face cars and in the subways in khaki in overalls they have come in haste and the garment of custom is rent by their hurried coming conventions have been put on awry or left off it is idle to remind oneself that a few women go into new work from love of adventure that some even share men’s roaming spirit after the new and the untried it is churlish to make these the outstanding features of a great movement it is no time to be churlish and it is useless go on just the same for the women are called behind the women who have ventured most and tasted the thrill of sacrifice and of danger stands the solid rank of their sisters comprehending and sympa thetic and the last line is only another drawn up army of reinforcements ready to protect the vanguard closing up to see fair play if there are bad conditions surround ing the new workers the watching rearguard must find a remedy not an inhibition there will be new questions to be settled and far visioned women see it men gone to the front will come home torn and broken to be gathered into the strong arms of unbroken women young boys whose profes sional careers have been lopped will come back to women who have marched on to professional achievement ready to take the lead this is no condition of women’s seeking but they are not blind to it now that it is here this is no time to stifle women’s forth faring spirit to maintain old and prejudiced barriers this is a time for making use of whatever material there is for building a new civilization which has been torn down america is standing by her fighting sons giving them every protection and support does america hold her daughters less priceless than her sons is she to give to the boys in khaki with full hands and hearty cheers and accord criticism scant praise and distrust to the grimy troop of women who have moved forward in their rear w’ill america hold on to the old obstructions for women above all will she continue to withhold that political freedom the lack of which has disrupted two continents the mobilization of women will would you be satisfied if you had bought a business with two sources of income in june of 1917 if in may of 1918 your receipts from one of these sources was three times what it had been in june of 1917 and your receipts from the other of these sources had sextupled would you be satisfied you wouldn’t if you were the woman citizen in june of 1917 the woman citizen corporation merged the subscription and advertising lists of three suffrage journals lopped off the dead wood and started in to interest women in a national weekly that would cover politics from woman’s viewpoint between that date and this the magazine’s receipts from adver tising have trebled and the receipts from subscription have sex tupled between that date and this we have increased our housing space until with the leslie suffrage bureau we now occupy the whole fifteenth floor of our building and we have doubled our force beginning with a sixteen page magazine without colored cover we have added a cover with the two color process and we have changed our type size so that a great deal more matter is pre sented in our text pages each issue than was presented in the beginning our circulation drive is gaining impetus daily all which is testimony to success and to growth yet we are not satisfied and cheerfully admit that we are never going to be during the ensuing year we shall still further enlarge the maga zine add to its program of special features extend its range of interests perfect its format and increase its circulation and june of 1919 will find us still not satisfied and projecting a further program for the magazine’s development why they need military rank 0 a quite general extent nurses are not saying much about the bill presented in congress by congressman raker from the woman suffrage state of california which would grant official rank to american nurses serving in military hospitals but they are thinking about it as was shown in the resolution passed on may io by the national organization of nurses of the united states in convention at cleveland one reason for the reticence of the nurses is that the stress put upon the bill’s urgency is one of reward easy popular interest has been aroused by the phrase give them the rank they de 9 serve as a reward for services rendered nurses are modestly silent let the laity see it through is their characteristic response to such a point of view the unwritten ethical code of the nursing profession being against all personal exploitation and that is becoming to the nurses but it sadly obscures the real issue the palpitating need for a rank relative to that of army men in order to save lives and take away from the military hospital as many horrors as possible miss amy hilliard superintendent of bellevue hospital train ing school has made this very clear in a recent statement fv a qmmn __a____ __ __ v v the woman citizen there are now in service 11,842 graduate nurses she says who have been given no recognition for their professional work and are neither enlisted nor commissioned at the present time they have no control of enlisted men nor of petty officers who work in the wards supposedly under them these men owe allegiance only to their superior officers the graduate nurse is in reality an outsider in a military organization and is helpless to make changes or improvements in ward conditions which her pro fessional knowledge tells her should be made she has no control of patients as if the ward master chooses he by reason of his rank takes precedence over her she has no control of ward linen equipment utensils nor of special diet when a group of nurses must work under army or navy sur geons the question of rank comes up immediately and under such circumstances the petty officers and enlisted men who have had no more medical training than an orderly in the city hospital are given authority which takes precedence over that of the nurse the bill now pending would create an army nurses corps in the medical department in which the superintendent would have the rank of major with six assistant superintendents as cap tains a director of nursing would be appointed for each sep arate military force outside the continental limits of the united states with assistants of the same rank chief nurses would be in the proportion of one to fifty nurses and the reserves would hold the rank of first or second lieutenant the superintendent or major would be appointed and removed by the secretary of war other members of the corps by the surgeon general the bill also contains provisions for promotions and for retirement on pay the nurses mark of rank would be the insignia of the army and would necessitate no change in the nurses uniform but as one nurse expressed it those two bars on our shoulders would mean prompt control when to be without control might mean disaster or death in emergencies where life itself is hanging on swift and accurate response to orders both are pleased political leaders who last saturday watched the first enrollment of new york women for the primaries are as pleased as can be with the results a prominent democrat says in the democratic districts there was a very heavy vote and from a purely party stand point the day was a most en couraging one a prominent republican says in all of the boroughs and in manhattan

votes for women campaigns in the new jewish state that is to be established in pales tine according to information sent out from zionist head quarters equal suffrage is accepted as a matter of course by the pioneers who are reorganizing jewish communal life to meet the requirements of national existence vhen word reached palestine that following the british declaration in favor of the establishment in that country of a national jewish home a jewish administrative commission was on its way to take over the actual government of jerusalem jah‘a and the jewish colonies all of the elements interested called conferences to facilitate the commission’s work equal suffrage was adopted by the jewish community of jaifa and a number of colonies and the women took part in all the proceed ings of the conferences even before the outbreak of the war equal suffrage had gained a strong foothold in palestine indeed it has prevailed from the very beginnings of the present jewish colonization during the 805 it is characteristic also of the zionist organizations throughout the world women vote at their international congresses and at the national conventions as a matter of

spain the women for the first time took a lively interest for months beforehand they had been eagerly studying public questions the reason is not far to seek in spain the war has raised the cost of living to a point that brings acute distress many of the people are on the brink of actual starvation when napoleon said that women ought not to meddle in politics a distinguished frenchwoman answered sire when women are liable to have their heads cut off it is natural that they should wish to know the reason why when women find that they and their children are in danger of death from starvation they naturally want to know the reason there is no such stimulus to inquiry as hun ger the terrible conditions that now prevail throughout 5 large 7 part of the world are making women think as never before the women of spanish america have generally taken as little interest in politics as the women of spain but in south america too there is coming a change one sign of it is a striking poem entitled lightning by josé santos chocano of peru the greatest living spanish american poet which may be translated as fol lows o ragged mother holding out thine hand forever at the doors in sorrow deep and seeing always bare and empty chests and human consciences fast locked in sleep 0 thou that goest gathering in the bag of thy sore poverty forevermore leavings that in the shipwreck of each day follies and vices cast upon the shore daughter art thou to him who went to war marched in the ranks and shed his blood unbought sank down in battle fell to earth and died and no one now remembers that he fought sister art thou to him who fell one day among machinery’s teeth which crush and kill the wheels were all indiferent to his fate and human hearts were more indiferent still widow art thou of one who at the plough died sunstruck as he labored on the plain today all eat the bread his wheat has made thou dost not eat it and he sowed the grain thou art the daughter and the sister poor the widow always left with child unborn thou art the mother who of every rag will make a flag when breaks to morrow's morn still as a consolation in thy womb a son of thy dead husband thou dost bear a cloud of rags its thoughts are of the sky but of a sky where tempest jills the air thy son will be no gentle cherub fair n o honey cup no mayflower soft of bloom o ragged mother lo thou art the cloud and thou dost bear the lightning in thy womb this poem was written some years before the war but the great world conflict has widened and intensified the conditions that it describes among its by

degree of doctor of philosophy the woman citizen resolved n every state in the union organized bodies of men and women are protesting at the senate’s delay in passing the federal suffrage amendment organized labor organized reli gion organized education organized philan thropy all are going on record with urgent resolutions within the last few days in the state of wisconsin alone the following reso lutions have been passed whereas in such a crisis as the present when we are engaged in a world wide struggle for democracy it is fitting expedient and proper that we should take every precaution to insure to our own citizens the fullest possible measure of democracy whereas democracy cannot be said to exist and a sense of justice and fair treatment can not be expected to continue so long as a large percentage of our adult population is excluded from important political rights on the sole ground of sex and whereas the resolution submitting to the states the question of suffrage for women has been repeatedly and unnecessarily delayed by congress and is at present being held in a committee of the senate for an unreasonable period of time thererore be it resolved that the madison federation of labor respectfully petitions that the aforesaid amendment shall be brought out immediately for consideration upon the floor of the senate and that it shall be favorably acted upon by the members j h brown president harry f collins secretary resolved that we the members of the sailors and soldiers home club of the little theater protest against the delay in the united states senate in taking the vote on the woman suffrage amendment already passed by the house of representatives we urge the senate to delay no longer but to pass the amendment at an early date not only in order that the women of these united states may take a position equal to that of the women of other nations less fundamentally democratic than ours but also to indicate to the world that thc senate of the united states is not lacking in belief in democracy and in the patriotic ideals and practical services of women signed edith adams stewart whereas women of the countries of our allies have been enfranchised as a war meas ure and whereas vvomen of these united states are every day demonstrating their capacity for the highest type of citizenship and whereas the house of representatives has passed the amendment to the federal consti tution abolishing sex as a requisite for voters while the president of the united states favors it and leaders in all political parties and all lines of thought and activity endorse it therefore resolved that we representatives of the milwaukee teachers association 1400 mem bers at a meeting held at assembly room first national bank on may 22 urge the sen ate to pass the woman suerage amendment without delay josephine f murphy president edith i o’neill secretary whereas the right of citizens to vote should not be denied or abridged on account of sex be it resolved that we the woman’s alliance of the first unitarian church of milwaukee urge upon the senate of the united states the im portance of immediate favorable action by that honorable body upon the amendment to the constitution of the united states known as the susan b anthony amendment harriet f richardson president e b kelloog mas carrie d kellooo double dyed patriotism atriotism was the keynote at the re cent annual meeting of the massachusetts woman suffrage association in boston as some quite inaccurate reports of the proceed ings got into the press it is worth while to give a correct account on the opening day i offered the following resolution which was adopted unanimously and with enthusiasm resolved that the delegates of the massa chusetts woman suffrage association in their 49th annual convention assembled renew their pledge of unswerving loyalty to our country in its great contest with a treacherous and ruth less foe we will give our best efforts to de fend it against enemies both foreign and do mestic we will continue and extend our war work we will support the constitution of the united states and stand solidly behind the great struggle to make the world safe for democ racy both at home and abroad not knowing that this resolution was to be offered professor albert bushnell hart of harvard also had brought in a resolution de claring the association's loyalty it was much longer and more elaborate than the first one and went more into detail but breathed the like spirit of patriotism an enthusiastic delegate proposed that the convention should pass both resolutions other delegates thought such ac tion superfluous holding that the one already adopted covered the ground after some dis cussion professor hart said that he should be satisfied with the passage of one section of his resolution and the following was then adopted with practical unanimity and with warm ap plause resolved that we pledge our support of the armies in the field of the president and con gress in the government of the workmen and workwomen engaged in providing the material of war according to our opportunity we will join in red cross and relief work we will pay our taxes and buy liberty bonds we will make public addresses use private influence and give the service of heart and soul to the continuance of the war mrs carrie chapman catt who was present said she was reminded of her first visit to paris she and her husband entered a restaurant where they found two big bowls containing two kinds of soup standing on opposite sides of the room the manager said both are good whichever you take you will be satisfied the same might be said of these resolutions you have passed both said mrs catt so your patriotism now is beyond cavil a s b digitized by 600816 june 1 1918 correspondence to the editor of the woman citizen the woman citizen demonstrates its fairness in presenting both sides of an issue in again trespassing upon its space i want it distinctly understood that i am not at variance with its principles when i answer the propaganda against the postal zone law published by mr s keith evans of new york city on the eighteenth he states that the loss alleged to have been sustained by the government is an absurdity yet at the same time he qualifies his statement that it cannot be established as a fact by stating that at least it hasn’t been and then he attempts to brush the whole matter aside by stating that the ways and means com mittee was guessing in asserting the loss figures the guessing has not been done by our com mittee but by the authors and distributors of the extensive propaganda against this law on may 15 1918 mr walter j clayton a merchant of el paso texas wrote me i have a letter from the review of reviews com pany warning me that if the postal zone law goes into effect we people here will have to pay five to seven times as much as the subscrib ers in eastern and northern states and i therefore urge you to have this law repealed i am just in receipt of a letter from the third assistant postmaster general dated may 22 1918 stating under the old law the rate on magazines from new york to both abilene texas and el paso texas is 1 cent per pound under the new zone law which goes into effect july 1 1918 the rate on magazines from new york to abilene texas which is in the seventh zone will be 1 cents per pound on reading matter and 3 cents per pound on advertising matter and from new york to el paso texas which is in the eighth zone the rate will be 1 cents per pound on reading matter and 3 cents per pound on advertising matter the latest issue of the review of reviews may 1918 weighs exactly 13 ounces and con tains the following 57 pages of advertising matter 100 pages of reading matter 10 pages of reviews and then 50 pages more of advertising matter in round numbers under the old law it cost 1 cent to send this magazine from new york to el paso which is about 2500 miles under the new zone law it will cost only 2 cents from new york to el paso or only 1 cents more per issue which is only 15 cents more per year and if it contained all reading matter it would cost only of a cent more per issue or only 3 cents more per year hence it can continue to run over a hundred pages of adver tising matter and still have to pay only 15 cents more per year postage which if added to the subscription price would make the subscriber merely pay 3.15 per year instead of 3 yet the review of reviews through this pernicious propaganda has caused my intelligent el paso constituent to believe that he will have to pay from five to seven times as much to wit from 15 to 21 subscription when all of the extra postage added to the regular subscription will make it only 3.15 per year i am just in receipt of an urgent letter from hon r f bell of houston texas treasurer of the hardwood jobbers association stating that the pictorial review is mailing a letter to all subscribers urging them to have their sena tors and congressmen repeal this pernicious law and i have today received from the gen eral assembly of the state of rhode island a copy of its resolution wherein in one of its whereases it states that we have increased the postal rates on magazines from 50 to 900 per cent and urges a repeal i am just in receipt of a letter from mr jesse h neal secretary treasurer of the publishers advisory board 200 fifth avenue new york city roasting me over the coals because i have seen fit to disabuse the minds of my constituents of all of these false impressions and in his mental dis comfiture he has forgotten himself far enough to attempt to scare and bulldoze me by saying we have received thousands of letters from texas citizens who are willing to fight rather than submit to this unjust undemocratic and inequitable provision of the zone postal law and i am quite sure that a very large number of your own constituents feel the same way about it in any event i would be glad to know whether you desire to modify in any way your statement that the publishers are grafters mr neal is not acquainted either with my constituents or their representative they are intelligent progressive citizens and they wouldn’t have a representative who scared now the pictorial review for may 1918 lacks just one ounce of weighing 1 pound the may 1918 ladies home journal weighs 17 ounces the literary digest for may 18 1918 weighs 10 ounces and the woman citizen for may 18 1918 weighs 3 ounces it is only a matter of calculation to ascertain what a very small additional sum in postage will be charged under the new zone law but it does make publishers pay more for advertising than for reading matter which is right and proper why didn’t mr neal and mr evans explain why it is necessary to concentrate all of the publishing plants in and around new york but he can’t dismiss the great nays and means committee with a shrug its great chairman hon claude kitchin is the demo cratic leader of the house and had our beloved speaker accepted the u s senatorship lately tendered him would have become speaker and the next ranking member hon henry t rainey would have become democratic leader of the house this is the committee which frames necessary billion dollar measures i am assured both by chairman kitchin and mr rainey that the figures heretofore given by me are correct and are based upon evidence care fully considered by them and are not guesses and i repeat the figures viz under the old law our government has sustained a loss each year of 90,000,000 on second class mail but for which it could have gone to a 1 cent letter postage and still had a surplus the publisher received 450,000 for the advertisements alone in the may 1917 issue of the ladies home journal yet it cost our government 20,000 more to circulate that one issue than it received from the publisher that we sustain an actual loss of 4,000,000 each year for carrying through the mails the publications of the curtis publish ing company alone during the last fiscal year the government lost 1,516,388 in carrying col lie s weekly 451,044 on the new york times and actually paid to the railroads 80,000 more than it received for hauling the outlook the 9 zone law recoups only a small part of it when we change it we must dig deeper for it comes out of the people in taxes thomas l blanton house of representatives washington d c why does he not follow wilson to the editor or rm woman citizen senator martin said in the united states senate on may 10 whenever i am satisfied that the majority of the white women of vir ginia desire to vote i will support the pro posed constitutional amendment he is satis fied that the majority of the women of vir ginia do not care to vote consequently will not at the present time support this amendment he desires a referendum to the women in order to find out that his conviction that the ma jority of all women do not want it is true we would like to ask why this method should be applied to this reform more than to any other was this test ever applied to any question concerning men why this discrimi nation in the case of women when mr martin was first made senator did the majority of the men of virginia vote to elect him was he not elected by the ma jority vote of the men of the legislature did he refuse to take his seat because he did not know the will of the majority of the men of the state concerning his election again did senator martin refuse a few months back to support the constitutional amendment for prohibition in congress be cause a majority of the men of virginia had not voted for prohibition'when it was referred to the men of this state it seems to have been satisfactory to him that only 94,000 voted for it when there were nearly 400,000 white men of voting age in virginia who might have had the privilege if they had wanted it he only de sired on this question to know that the ma jority of those who cared enough to go to the polls favored it he only desired to know that there were many more advocates than opponents now we would suggest that he apply these same tests to the suerage movement in vir ginia he could get his statistics in a short while if he would give it his careful considera tion he would find out that there are many more advocates than opponents the suffragists far outnumber the antis and if senator mar 1 tin could have his wish for a referendum to the women a large majority of those who care enough to express their opinion at the polls would favor it there have always been many more petitioners to the legislature than re monstrants against it are not these tests the fair tests are not these tests the ones which have been applied to the reforms which men have wanted the majority of men as well as women are indif ferent to the voting privilege only about 80,000 out of a possible electorate of 400,000 generally cast their ballots would senator martin refuse to consider any question favor ably until a majority of 400.000 come out for it why this discrimination in the case of women why does not senator martin follow his leader woodrow wilson in favoring the amendment

master plumber and paymaster nce upon a time automobile men said 0 women could never learn to drive cars because they were not natural mechanics their right elbows were made differently from a man’s or something equally pertinent to day at the front women are driving big motor trucks as well as ambulances and at home to day the woman with a tool kit is as familiar as the woman with a knitting bag 50 when i heard of a woman who was a master plumber i was not surprised but in terested perhaps i had a vision of cheap labor in the plumbing business and a possible reduction in the high cost of the bath tub anyway i wanted to meet the woman who had had the temerity to invade the sacred pre cincts of the plumbing trust she was i found employed on some government work in wash ington and i asked for an interview in spite of explicit directions it took some time to locate her but with the help of an officer several workmen and one or two civil ians i finally found her in one of the wooden shacks which fringe the government’s new buildings the locality was a beehive of industry buildings in various stages of com pletion swarmed with workmen with officers the roads were crowded with trucks engines pounded whistles screamed and in the midst of the hurlyburly a cool little woman sat perched at her desk in the paymaster’s otiice i had expected to interview a master plumber as i had said but i soon learned that anything approaching a static condition was not in the cool little woman’s line she was no longer a master plumber but paymaster for the plumb ing heating and electrical workers on the job at sixth and b streets for the g f cornell company and in spite of her littleness and an almost girlish quality of youth her poise made her position of authority seem a natural one i eagerly acquiesced in her suggestion that we make a round of the shops a take these flanges see how they are made the woman citizen the woman and the calling i discovered that all the men knew her and liked her it was not surprising for with a quick wit and a bub bling good humor she combines an instinc tive sympathy and an admirable tact only an unusual woman could h o l d such an unusual position i suggested there is nothing unusual in my being a mechanic she laughed i was born one when i go into a shop i don’t know why things should be done so i just know that they should it is instinctive my father kept a bicycle shop with a side line of hardware after school i used to go to the shop to help him it was natural for me to take things apart and put them together again i tinkered for the love of it then i married my hus band was a successful business man and i gave up the shop for the home when my baby was only a few months old my husband died suddenly and i found myself left with a young baby on my hands and no means of support for while my husband had made a comfortable income we were too young to have thought of a rainy day i had his last week’s salary in my purse and that 75.00 was all that stood between me and my baby and want of course i had my father to take care of me if i had wanted to be taken care of but i wanted to take care of myself unconsciously the little woman squared her shoulders rules trouble god’s purposes in the tom convention betn y father paid the funeral expenses and i went to work i got a position in a little town in illinois i didn’t like that little town and it didn’t like me it criticised my clothes i had rather nice things but they were in colors and the town thought i should go in mourning i couldn’t i didn't have any money to buy black clothes i had to wear what i had but i stayed on first with a hardware store and then as a nurse it was a boom town and there were a lot of young married couples and all the girl brides were having babies i have helped to bring many a baby into the world while the house was being built the mother and the baby would be snugly covered but the doctor and the nurse would have the rain running down their necks in little rivulets through leaky canvas from illinois i went to texas my first position was with a firm of mechanical engineers there was a master plumber with the company an irish genius finest master plumber in texas but he had his weakness i was his assistant and grad ually took over more and more of the work finally the company divided its business into two territories and i had charge of the north ern field where did you get your training as a mas ter plumber picked most of it up in the shops one can learn a lot by watching get men interested in their work and they will tell you all they know and if you have a bent for mechanics it is easy to absorb what they give out now god made the woman it’s a dtvtston of labor that tnvttes men can’t make rules that come up to past woman's has been restricted by man made law cus to day under the stress woman’s capacity is g urged to the utmost expression and where it is all to end nobody knows certain it is that see will never again be allowed to tnterpose as an am at barrier between the woman and the cal no of war made necessity man made the i tried to but as my acquaintance with ma chinery is limited to my typewriter fianges and hydraulic presses and acetylene gas for welding were quite too much for me every now and then my guide would stop be fore some workman with a word of praise or some tactful sugges tion and invariably he listened attentively and invariably did what she said the contrast was striking the pale collected little woman quietly effective and the big burly mechanics begrimed and skillful working in complete harmony i mentioned one workman whom i had noticed particularly paying close attention to her re marks she laughed that man said that he wouldn’t work for a woman if i came into the shop when i left to go to another shop he said he would leave if i didn’t stay and he did when i came back he came back it is all in estab lishing a spirit of co operation the men and i work together because we are all interested in the work potential capacity but hen i went with my present em ployer i went in at 15.00 a week i had just returned to washington and i had to establish myself i found that having been a master plumber was really against me the men didn’t believe that i was a real master plumber and were inclined to be wary of my experience however i knew i could make myself useful in an office at 15.00 even if it were only desk work i accepted a job with a construction company determined to show that i could make good making good is largely a matter of stick to it iveness i have never let any job discourage me no matter how big the handi caps i have reasoned if the other fellow could do it i could do it many a time i have bluf’fed my way through until i could get the needed experience if one is willing to work and is pliable anybody of average brains can take care of himself or herself i have always been glad of my business training if more women understood business there wouldn’t be so many of them for men to take care of you are everything you ought not to be i objected according to the rules yes but you see i didn’t make the rules they are man’s rules my father thinks i am very masculine because i have succeeded at a man’s trade still i am enough of a woman to enjoy the home i have made for myself and my child there are days when i never want to see a shop but if i didn’t go into the shop i couldn’t keep up the home so there i am and there she was mrs alma e crook master plumber and paymaster talking she drove a car with such consum mate skill that even my nervousness was lulled into a peaceful sense of security before you go i want you to see my home said the paymaster next she pointed out a cosy little cottage where

woman’s admission to all honor examinations at cambridge by a vote of 398 to 32 the following advice from the lead ing doctor of cambridgeshire is quoted let not women in general suppose that they

she loses caste when she does easier work for fewer hours away from home and takes money for it there’s the rub women may toil sixteen hours a day in the seclusion of home waste strength in charity

women as recorded in its early issues this story of a wis consin legislature of long ago is reminiscent of the joke played on women by a georgia legislature no later than 1916 mrs marion dudley had been per mitted to address the nisconsin legislature on woman suffrage for a period of an hour and a half and her remarks had been pamphleted by the legislature and a resolution passed but the janesville gazette assures its readers the following winter that that action was taken only in a spirit of playfulness a method of spending its time which seems hardly worthy of a legislative body the woman sea captain he woman citizen is in receipt of a letter from the first woman in italy to gain a diploma as captain of a merchant marine ves sel she is signorina elisa f belluomini of via reggio and says she is glad to know of the woman citizen since it is a periodical protect ing the interests of women and she makes the observation that while it is true that she has gained a diploma as captain she is at pres ent not able to undertake voyages since her government does not permit women such ad venturous careers she hopessoon however to make long sea courses she is not the first woman sea captain al though hers may be the first official appointment martha’s vineyard and new bedford are full of traditions of wives of sea captains who brought their husbands ships safely to port in years gone by it is moreover reported that the woman navigator is a familiar incident in ha waiian coastwise trade according to report miss belluomini passed the regular examinations as a captain in the merchant marine service and qualified for the post because she just naturally wanted to be a sailor she grew up among sea faring folk and acquired the same yearning for the sea which has made many a lad run away from home ob durate relatives tried to turn her mind into the accustomed feminine channels but they made no more headway than if she had been a boy finally a sympathetic old captain recom mended her to the maritime authorities of li vourne it has needed a special decree and a tussle with the mariners union to enable miss belloumini to get past the initial difiiculties of her profession in spite of the fact that her progress in the nautical institute of via reggio had been phenomenal and won her the respect and assistance of every one of her professors and fellow students she still had to face the stubborn resistance of the organized mariners her perseverance has finally won her a master’s license in the ocean going trade and she enters the profession when submarines

york state woman suffrage association meets in its efforts to prepare the women voters among the foreign population for their new duties this may be the italian man’s response some times not often but it is not the response of his wife little bright eyed wife has notions in her wise head other than the spagette and the flower of cloth maybe it is the dis proportion between the cost of spagette and the wages one earns for maka the flower that is responsible for some of her ideas anyway she follows thecommittee to the door and whispers lady i go thata school you tella me the night my husband he go out at night i wait and i go thata school he be prouda when i reada the english he american citi zen i be little american citizen that is the prideful spirit they are of these women may not know who is governor of the state nor what a state is nor yet a governor but they know that a new dignity has fallen l upon them they have been so long accus tomed to being overlooked that it means new life to them to be wanted needed sought out i don’t speak no more with you says mrs willowsky to her neighbor i am ashame for talk with pe0ples like you your man he been in this country ten years an he ain’d got his first papers out already my husband is a citi zen and you listen what i tell you that you don know maybe i am a citizen too own in one of the assembly districts in new york city soon after the winning of the vote last november the suffrage americani zation committee and the henry street settle ment in co operation gave a first voters party for several election districts in the direct neighborhood of the settlement the list of registered voters at the last election was used as a basis of invitation we assumed said miss esther lape secretary of the americani zation committee that the men were mar ried a fairly safe assumption as it proved and sent cards to their wives asking them to come to a first voters party several hundred came most of them non english speaking women who had not been in the habit of com ing to the settlement to the mothers club or to group gatherings of any kind for the first time in their lives they came together as ameri can citizens and they were very conscious of their added value to themselves to their neigh bors and to their husbands in their newly de fined citizenship one of them who had counted for days upon coming to the party told of beginning her preparations early in the evening the chief part of this preparation consisted in putting on a long unused article of dress and to judge from her own descrip tion the process was something between a ceremony and an operation when she was about ready to leave her husband arrived he was nothing less than astounded by the unwonted prospect of his wife’s going out for the evening she told him why and where she was going to the first voters party at henry street but how can you go asked this amiable american you are not a citizen you are a citizen she asked of course he answered i have my papers you know then said the wife i am a citizen too i go to the party and she went while groups of anti suffragists have been deploring the fact that the enfran chisement of women will mean an increase in the ignorant vote suffragists nearer to the heart of the democratic ideal see an altogether different and a more reassuring thing they see an opportunity to awaken every citizen man and woman to the realization of america the americanization committee was formed as a part of the educational movement within the new york state woman suffrage party to prepare women to use their votes intelli gently but very early indeed in the work it became evident that for foreign born women many thousands of whom are non english speaking and many thousands illiterate political education must be preceded by fundamentals these fundamentals of americanization mean an understanding of american institutions and a knowledge of the english language for al though foreign born men and women may be shown many things through their own lan guage the fact remains that they must function as citizens in english because english is the language of our civic and business life the average foreign born woman in new york city is not at all interested in the ma chinery of voting she cares little about wards and election districts and political divisions but she knows what any one means who tells her that the board of aldermen are discussing free lunches and playgrounds and that they de termine the lighting and cleaning of the streets she easily follows the well marked educational road from the particular to the general from the concrete to the abstract to get at their public and to follow out their general plan of work the americaniza tion committee is organized in the industrial towns of the state and in each assembly dis trict of the city on their advisory councils for the various assembly districts the commit tee has secured representatives of all the agencies doing americanization work in the districts he general plan of work is everywhere the same and includes the formation of classes in the english language and civics in public schools settlements and neighborhood houses a corps of house to house workers classes in factories wherever practicable and the estab lishment of information centers forty five information centers have been es tablished in the borough of manhattan where immigrant women and immigrant men too for that matter may receive information in citizen ship naturalization voting and the most im portant matters before governing boards leg digitized by 600816 war matters such as drafts food restrictions and rationing most immigrant women cannot go far for information because of the expense of carfare if for no other reason and those who have sons and brothers in the army especially those who read news papers scarcely at all will be more and more dependent on these centers he americanization committee with the co operation of the state department of education has succeeded in putting through the new york state legislature a bill provid ing for the training of teachers both public school teachers and others for the teaching of adult illiterates the bill carries an appropria tion to make it possible to establish training institutes for teachers both in the state normal schools and in the various cities of the state miss mary dreier chairman of the state suf frage party’s americanization committee has recently explained why the bill’s passage is important just now we feel that there are two immediate rea sons for urging this bill she said at yap hank alone there are 1.5 men who do not speak or understand english as secre tary lane pointed out the other day these men cannot read the manual of arms cannot even understand orders at the various camps some effort is being made to teach these men english but in later drafts they should be taught before they leave for the camp with good teachers it is possible to give men a working knowledge of english in a short time there are over 600,000 non english speak ing adults in new york state now many of whom are illiterate in any language because of the war it is now more essential than ever that the citizens of this and every other state should be equipped with the english language and an understanding of american ideals otherwise they cannot keep in touch with or understand our present national aims here is a second great reason for the immediate passage and operation of this bill there are now at least three hundred thou sand women in new york state unable to speak english and 225,000 of these are illiterate in any language many of these women may vote next fall we cannot teach them to vote in dependently and intelligently in a few months but a working knowledge of english will be a great step toward independent citizenship for them it is the language of our civic and busi ness life and i do not believe we can have competent american citizens without it good teachers are the crux of the whole situation and everywhere educational authori ties admit that teaching adult immigrants is very different from teaching children and that the failure in experiments in adult immigrant education is most often due to the lack of trained teachers you can get foreign born men and women to public night schools but you cannot keep them there unless you have teachers that understand their needs and their mature interests and are trained in methods of teaching them as a war measure and as a fundamental civic need we have urged the passage of this bill june 1 1918 15 your vote and your state he american citizen recognizes two sov ereignties state and nation two sovereignties do not divide his allegiance for the spheres of state and federal govern ment at no point overlap the federal gov ernment will be described in a later article its functions are very definite and touch the life of the citizen scarcely at all the state govern ment touches the life of the citizen as beard expresses it from the cradle to the grave the state as we saw in earlier chapters delegates some of its executive and adminis trative powers to local governmental units in cluding administration of justice in lower courts health roads education and the business of enancing the local government how much of this work is done and paid for by the local governments can be judged by the fact that at the last census the governments of the forty eight states cost about one hundred and twenty 5ve million while the local governments cost almost one and one half billion thus the de tailed work and the bulk of the cost of govern ment within the boundaries of the state is not borne by the state itself but by its subordinate units of legislation the reverse is true all legisla tive power remains with the state itself the ordinances permitted to local governments being in most states only those necessary to carry out the executive and administrative work laid upon them by state laws he powers and the framework of state gov ernments are laid down in written cbnstitu tions from the point of view of democracy the most important clauses in these constitu tions are the suffrage clause which makes the people or part of the people the source of gov ernment and the bill of rights which stands at the beginning of all constitutions forbidding encroachments on civil rights and ensuring to the people security of life liberty and property state legislation aims to make good this bill of rights and to regulate all life and business woodrow wilson in the state groups leg islation common to nations under laws required for the protection of life and property and laws which aim to promote the common welfare leaving out the few of his classifications which lie within the scope of the federal government the rest serve as a summary of our state laws under the hrst group we have laws designed to keep order and protect persons and property regulate legal relations in the family regulate the holding transmission and interchange of property contracts crime civil justice duties privileges and relations of citizens under the second we have laws which regulate or provide for trade and industry labor roads and internal improvements light and water sanitation and health education charities conservation and sumptuary laws such as prohibition etc not specifically provided for in this list are the laws which regulate all the details of local governments and in so far as these are covered by legislation of state administrative boards or commissions for the passing carrying out and preserving of these laws and for doing the business of the state the state constitution provides a three part government legislative american citizenship yet these by mary sumner boyd executive and judicial framed like most of the local governments already described on the model adopted by the federal government in 1787 all laws not covered or not forbidden in the bill of rights for the protection of the people by the state constitution and its amendments are passed by the state legislature they must be ratified or vetoed by the governor the chief executive officer of the state and if the gov ernor ratifies they may be declared unconstitu tional and wiped off the statute books by the state supreme court thus the three parts of the government are relied upon to check and balance each other and prevent the passing of hasty legislation furthermore the legislature is divided into two parts through both of which a bill must pass before it goes to the governor and this it is claimed is a further check on ill considered legislation he government thus roughly outlined is a pure representative government in which the voter has no part except to choose at the polls who shall make the laws and who shall carry them into effect as we saw in a few cities so in a few states the initiative referen dum and recall gives the voter more power than this over legislation and legislators but the almost pure representative form of government is still characteristic of most of our states state legislatures are as we have seen made up of two houses the upper house or senate and the lower the assembly house of delegates or house of representatives members of both are apportioned to population and elected by the voters of fixed districts a senatorial district being very much larger than an assembly dis trict so that the upper house is smaller than the lower in louisiana for instance the senate has only about a quarter as many members as the assembly minnesota has the largest senate n0 place to land 62 members and delaware the smallest l7 the states do not have a common population basis for representation in their legislatures nevada with the smallest population in the union has 22 senators and new york with the largest has 51 the relative proportions of the two houses vary delaware has 35 assemblymen or about double the number of senators massachusetts 3 ratio of 6 to 1 delaware has'the smallest house and new hampshire has the largest 450 members new york with 25 times the population of new hampshire has only 150 assemblymen there are all told 7,347 mem bers of state legislatures in the 48 states of whom more than three fourths sit in the lower house pay for members ranges from 200 a term 2 years in new hampshire to 3,500 a session 1 year in illinois in all states but mississippi and alabama which set four years and massachusetts new jersey and new york one year the term of representatives or assemblymen is two years massachusetts has a one year term for senators and the other states are about evenly divided in setting two or four years for the upper house the length of legislative sessions is unlimited in 16 states in the rest it ranges from 40 to 90 days and these sessions are held in all but 8 states biennially in alabama and mississippi regular sessions are quadrennial and in new york new jersey massachusetts south caro lina rhode island and georgia they are annual it is estimated that through these legislative mills each session there pass taking the 48 ses sions together over 50,000 bills of which a third become law to expedite the disposal of this vast number of bills which average considerably over 1,000 a session to a state both houses are divided into committees to con sider bills of certain types the commonest committees are ways and means judiciary cities railroads education tax health banks insurance and rules speaker elected by the house and always representing the political party of the ma jority presides over the deliberations of the assembly the corresponding officer in the sen ate called its president is in 34 states the lieu tenant governor in the others he is elected as in the assembly both houses have a few functionaries clerks sergeant at arms etc according to the usual procedure a bill is introduced read and referred to the proper committee which either reports favorably or kills it if reported favorably it is read a second and a third time amended and voted on if the vote is favorable it is then sent to the other house where it goes through the same course all bills except bills for revenue which must originate in the lower house can originate in either house and the same bill can be intro duced in both houses independently a bill amended in the second house must be returned to the first for approval having passed the legislature a bill then goes to the governor for ratification and if he vetoes it it must pass again in'live states by a three fifths vote in 9 by a full majority and in the rest by a two continued on page 18 digitized by the woman’s department at our fifth avenue ohice is in charge of

association during the week confirms the statements made by nebraska suf frage leaders that fraudulent petitions were circulated in neb raska to hold up the presidential woman suffrage bill of the state by subjecting it to a referendum in order to register the will of the people the hearing on this case which caused much excite ment in nebraska was carried on all last week and is continuing through the present week at this writing sufficient evidence seems to be in hand to dem onstrate to the public just what agencies work with bona fide anti suffragists to delay suffrage measures a telegram from elmer e thomas of omaha neb attorney for the nebraska woman suffrage association is sufficiently revelatory to be quoted in full suffragists took evidence at omaha all last week exam

sort of tactics reported here that has turned suffra gists from the state route forever again and again it has been made evident that sinister forces are able so to manipulate mat ters within a state as to defeat the will of the pe0ple on the suf frage question again and again suffragists have tried to get this evidence thoroughly sifted in state courts it is hoped that the nebraska case will establish a precedent for an impartial weighing of the facts and it is certain that the facts as already adduced form the strongest possible argument for the federal by that route state legislators will pass on the suffrage question nebraska women were given presidential suf suffrage route frage by nebraska’s legislators after all the legislators of a state may be more hopefully expected to represent the will of the people than such agencies as those that got behind the circulation of the inebraska petitions for a referendum world wide significance n the telegram sent last week to leon s haas member of the state senate of louisiana urging the legislature of that state to give its approval to suffrage for women president wilson showed how completely he has become imbued with the view that america is injured in the world’s eyes until she standardizes her democracy by giving american women the right of self government to the end that the nation may stand forth before the world as a fair and just exponent of that gospel of democracy which she preaches and fights for l i hope wired the president that you will not think that i am taking an unwarranted liberty in expressing my deep in terest in the suffrage question before your committee i cannot help regarding the settlement of this question as of world wide significance and as affording a standard by which to judge our present interest in the complete establishment of democracy i am moved to send you this expression of opinion by a very pro found sense of the public inter digitized bngosiq 46 full suffrage for canada drowned by the roar of cannon on the battlefields of europe a great suffrage victory pealed softly through canada the latter part of may the canadian suffrage bill known as the government’s votes for women bill a sweeping national suffrage measure having passed the house of com mons in the early spring passed second reading in april and third reading in may receiving the royal assent at once the provisions of the bill entirely rectify the injustices of the war time elections act which was passed last year under that act nicknamed the disfranchising act the voting privi lege was limited to women whose immediate male relatives were in the war its enactment was sharply challenged and sir robert borden premier made haste to assure its critics that if he were re elected he would at once sponsor a suffrage bill of the most sweeping content he kept his word and under the new bill which has now become law all women over 21 british and not disqualified from voting by race and nationality restrictions of their own provinces are enfranchised for the purposes of the bill a woman is con sidered british if born british and either unmarried or mar ried if foreign born and married to a britisher or foreign born and possessed of her own nationalization papers wives of alien enemies cannot vote the bill goes a long way toward eliminating from the canadian polity the absurdities by virtue of which a woman in almost all other countries takes off and puts on nationality with her mar riage it is moreover far in advance of great britain’s suffrage act with its unfair age discrimination and it should serve as an urgent reminder to the united states senators that they owe it to america to place her on a par with the world leaders of democracy by passing the federal suffrage amendment cambric needle and time use e very now and then we pause to say to ourselves now don’t for goodness sake claim too much for women over boasting is as bad as under valuing under paying over just try to help get the artificial barriers out of the way and let it go at that and having thus warned ourselves into a state of utterly working vomen must stand or fall by their merits judicial poise we pick up the paper and read things like this it has been found according to manufacturers that women are proving more accurate than men in the timing of fuses and in inspection where particularly keen eyesight is required they are proving better than men in assembling because of the nimble ness of their fingers that did not originate with us mind you the national var board studies are being made by the industrial service section of that comes from the woman citizen the army ordnance department in district plants of conditions under which women are employed suggestions as to employ ment management and health conditions are being passed on to manufacturers and women are being assigned to work on drill presses the making and marking of fuses loading of shells assembling of artillery inspection drafting electrical and car pentry work but when it comes to a question of woman’s capacity to drop a slip of paper in a ballot box really you know the strain would be too awful woman’s weapon used to be a stiletto a little sharp dagger with which she punched holes in linen and filled them in with tiny stitches it was her fine lady task once to mark her linen counting two threads this and two that for a diminutive cross stitch she could thread a cambric needle with a gossamer thread that would have mended ariel’s wings or seamed puck’s girdle and people thought it all so useless this punching holes in cloth and sewing them up again smiled superior men and now it seems that all this training in delicacy of touch and sight wa'sn’t wasted it can be used in making time fuses all of which accentuates anew that there are generally at least two roads by which efficiency is acquired the man’s way and the woman’s way men achieved success in making muni women achieved by defter fingers and keener eyesight both ways seem good why discriminate against either tions by heavier muscles than women’s readjusting election machinery ew york city has already begun the important task of readjusting its election machinery to accommodate the large army of women voters who will take part in future city elections to that end it is reapportioning election districts and will add approximately 500 districts to those already established machinery sufficient to accommodate the 350,000 or more joi‘i‘ch voters who it is estimated will take part in the fall elections perhaps the greatest difficulty confronting the board of lilec fions is in obtaining the proper facilities for polling booths women have in many instances objected to barber shops and other unsuitable places as polling booths and on the men voters who have stood discomfort perennially in the matter of polling places is dawning the hope that improvement is not only possible but imminent ready n commenting editorially on the action of the democratic state central committee of connecticut in endorsing the federal suffrage amendment the hartford post says suf frage is coming coming by federal amendment

determination gain and again come indications that hungary is trying to break through the iron ring of the central powers her lack of harmony with the teutons is again manifest in the resumption of the fight for woman suffrage within her borders prussianism cannot brook anything so democratic as self govern ment for women and hungary’s determination to take this for ward step in democracy has caused grave anxiety to kaiser and emperor it was the woman suffrage question which overthrew the first wekerle cabinet just the same wekerle again premier is announcing according to budapest dispatches that he will move at the next plenary session of the hungarian par liament a resolution returning to the franchise bill the clause relating to woman suffrage methodists in the vanguard urther explanations reveal the full significance of the action taken recently by the methodist episcopal church south with regard to granting full laity rights to women all laws of the church have been changed with reference to women and they will have the same status as men in the view of rev forest j prettyman of the executive committee of the commis sion on war work of the methodist episcopal church south before the changed laws can be put into practice they must be ratified by a three fourths vote of all voting in the annual con ferences this was a ruling of the bishops to insure the con stitutionality of the procedure a ruling that gave rise to the interpretation that the bishops had vetoed the measure but according to mr prettyman there is no doubt about the con ferences seconding the action of the general conference women will then be eligible to all boards to be trustees superintendents of sunday schools stewards epworth league presidents and all other positions held by men the southern baptists adopted similar measures at their recent convention held in hot springs ark is new york guilty afew weeks ago a dramatic thing happened when gov ernor whitman of new york state was at the black stone hotel in chicago he was waited on by twenty boys of the boys brotherhood republic who had come to appeal for mercy for paul chapman sixteen years and three months old awaiting the electric chair in sing sing death house the motto of this republic is when a kid’s in trouble we’re in trouble and their question to the governor was p what is the matter with new york given to a boy of chapman’s age we are interested in chap man they continued because the boys of chicago feel that a boy of his age should live in spite of his misstep if the state of new york will allow this boy to be killed the boys of illinois will charge your state with murder here in chicago no such sentence would ever be are the boys of chicago justified in their charge against new york state 47 paul chapman seems to be undeniably a criminal but not he deliberately entered an apartment for burglary butnot for murder there is a law in new york state which provides that when a homicide is committed by a person engaged in the commission of or in an attempt to commit a felony whether the killing is undeniably a murderer intentional or not it is murder in the first degree the extreme rigor of the law is however seldom invoked yet it is to be invoked in new york state and applied to a boy of sixteen right here rests the justice of the question raised by the brotherhood in chicago in behalf of paul chapman should a boy of sixteen held too youngato be financially responsible held too young to cast a vote to enter into business contracts be made answerable for his crimes as an adult is answerable j will new york state be guilty of murder if paul chapman’s sentence is not repealed a the law of new york state has nothing in it to prevent the electrocution of any child over seven years of age below that age all children are by common law everywhere held criminally irresponsible from 7 to i4 they are presumably irresponsible except in new york and minnesota where by statute law years of dubious discretion end at 12 in only one state illinois has the lower limit of criminal responsibility been raised above 14 and there it is 17 for boys and 18 for girls a fact which justifies the chicago brotherhood in saying that in chicago such a sen tence as that on paul chapman could not have been passed twelve states have done away with capital punishment alto gether so that in 14 states the tragedy of electrocuting a six teen year old boy could not happen here are on record in the united states some half dozen cases only where infants of dubious years under 14 i have been hanged for murder and these are mainly ancient his tory there is said to have been only one other child of chap man’s age in new york state who suffered the extreme penalty of murder in his case by hanging before the movement for juvenile courts at the beginning of the twentieth century texas was the only state that protected the child miscreant over 14 now all but eight have juvenile court laws all except virginia extend legal protection beyond i4 years some to 16 others to 17 18 and even 19 years in only five states having juvenile courts new york indiana iowa massachusetts and new jersey is the child who has com mitted a crime punishable by death expressly excluded from the protection of these courts and turned over as an adult is to the criminal courts for punishment i in view of the progress made by other states in protecting adolescence from the full burden of adult responsibility it seems as if new york is at the world’s bar of judgment in the matter of paul chapman’s sentence the burden of proof that it is justified in filliping away the growing demand for the right of a child to be judged as a child and not as an adult rests upon new

of woman’s part in this war is written the men who are opposing suffrage for women will hang their heads in shame for they will be proved disloyal to their wives mothers and sisters said mrs j ross thomson in her address as president of the maryland association the suffragists took a just pride in their long list of war activities as shown in the report of mrs william milnes maloy who is also secretary of the woman’s section maryland council of de fense the report showed that women who are active in the state suffrage work are lead ers on war service committees and divisions practically the full number of delegates was present and with their alternates and a large number of visitors formed an enthusiastic au dience as reports of legislative work and war service work were given it was decided to leave the plans for the ratification campaign largely within the hands of the state board committees to carry on this important part of the year’s work will be announced later the board by

students of the university of missouri who went forth to pick the luscious fruit in the fields near sarcoxie the young women undertook their novel labors in response to a call for berry pickers to solve a critical situation due to the shortage of hands the woman’s council of defense of mis souri adopted the labor shortage as one of its particular problems and it was in answer to the word that went out from the council that women were needed in the berry fields that 500 women responded mrs walter mcnab miller president of the missouri suffrage association and chairman of the woman's committee of the‘national coun cil of defense for that state was one of the women interested in promoting this new ven ture upon her return from the berry fields mrs miller is enthusiastic in her report of the success of the experiment the problem of seasonal trades is always difficult says mrs miller but southwestern fruit counties have not been in such straits until this year this practical illustration of seeing the problem and coming to solve it speaks well for the univer sity girl of the future one girl said she was learning more by this experience than in all the lessons she has had in economics and so ciology she is getting her illustrations first hand mrs miller emphasized the fact that it was not to make money that these young women went into the fields but from a patriotic

one of the important and influential papers in ohio is boosting the amend ment the papers spoken of by ohioans as governor cox’s papers said editorially the suffragists are hopeful but it appears that they lack one vote to insure victory for their cause let us suppose that the necessary vote is lacking when the vote is called and that it shall become necessary on that account to make it known to the other civilized nations that the united states continues to deny citi zenship to its women is it possible to believe that the senator upon whom responsibility for such a termination of the contest

have to be made to the homes and apartment houses in the neighborhood to introduce the idea but so widespread has been the demand that no visiting has been necessary it seems to be filling a long felt want a home meal that is a home meal prepared without effort to the housekeeper and at the lowest possible cost for good values he movement is not a charity or a philan thropy it is a business project incorpor ated under the laws of new york the earning power is limited to six per cent and all excess profits will be turned back into the business to react to the benefit of the consumer this

under the direction of an expert dietician who takes the week as her working unit economy commensurate with good service and adequate results is the stand ard aimed at 66 his is primarily a war measure said miss jessie h bancroft who is not only president of the board directing the movement but was a leading spirit in its formation and launching but we expect to continue after this period of stress and hope to be a potent factor during the period of adjustment and reconstruc tion that must follow our fundamental aim at this time is to keep homes together during the great draft of women into industry for the war to release women for war service work and at the same time keep intact the home life this service is designed to reach all groups the business and professional woman the dweller in the hall bedroom who longs for home meals but is without facilities for cooking the families on small income who do not have maid service the large family where the work devolves upon the mother the dweller in the private home and the highest type of apartment house for a long time i thought the centralized or community kitchen would solve many of the vexing problems of the housekeeper i felt the saving in food waste in the upkeep of the individual kitchen together with the saving in labor were matters that would combine to make the movement feasible and practical i am happy to say our first station has more than justified that belief since we started i have been intensely interested in finding how many persons seemed to have had this idea in mind and were just waiting to see it put in operation practically every third person seems to have felt years ago that this was the way to solve one of the most important of housekeeping problems so you see it is not a new thing after all that we have here we have crystal lized the ideas that have been in the air and worked them out to a practical solution every thing at the present tended to make this the right time to make the start there are unlimited possibilities to this movement and 51 we do not intend to stop with one station every neighborhood should have its station each station being adjusted to meet the popular de mands from that particular neigh borhood then there is the matter of the special diet for invalids for persons who must have food pre pared in certain ways the horizon seems boundless it will take a little time but it is by no means unreason able to think all this in time will be included in the cooked food service requests for information in regard to the station are coming in from a number of cities anxious to know how it all works out food is an im portant problem and plays a tremen dous part in the upbuilding of a na tion surely if ever we needed 100 per cent efficiency it is now we believe we have started the nucleus of what is to be an extended movement of lasting and genuine service to the people ow just suppose you have been placed on the active list at schuyler station and you decide upon the fifty cent dinner and wish to be a regular patron thefirst thing to do is to get a coupon book being a regular patron means that you want service five or more nights in the week and for convenience the coupon book has been arranged thus simplifying the payment for each meal in deciding upon the fifty cent dinner you are making the popular choice if you are not a regular patron that is if you only plan to patronize the station at intervals rather far apart you must pay seventy five cents for this same service the thirty hve cent dinner is served to families of six or more and is designed to meet the need of families with several children but to return to a representative menu for the fiftyacent dinner and its portion per person first you will have soup very nearly a half pint measure of it then a choice of roastbeef or nut loaf if you choose the former you will get a piece of the rare a piece of well done and a small piece of fat that is unless you have specified otherwise if your choice was nut loaf you will get a square about four inches by an inch or so in thickness with tomato sauce then come brown potatoes one if they are large two if not a moderate sized ladle of buttered beets a similar portion of cauliflower in cream sauce and salad will follow the salad will be two good sized leaves of head lettuce with cream cheese and french dressing for dessert you will have a square of cottage pudding with sauce or a portion of lemon jelly perhaps you are investing in a dollar dinner then you have a more elaborate menu which would run about like this half a grapefruit with a cherry olives and radishes an entrée of curried codfish roast beef and browned potatoes hot buttered beets peas 3 salad of hearts of lettuce and a choice of lemon pie or chocolate blanc mange just as for the other services the menus for the dollar dinner admit of variety for the thirty five cent dinner you would get the fifty cent dinner with this change either the salad or the dessert course eliminated very soon the thirty tive cent dinner is to have a printed menu all its own as it grows in popularity the station is serving lunchenns also the woman citizen notes and comment the zone system he new zone system for newspaper post age which is soon to go into effect unless repealed grows worse the more it is studied increasing the postage on periodicals from 50 to 900 per cent it is clear on the face of it that it will kill many papers and lessen the cir culation of all for when they are forced to put their prices up fewer people can afford to take them professor linn of chicago university pointed out at the senate hearing the great edu cational value of a number of the leading maga zines and how they are constantly used in our schools and colleges all over the country as text books used in courses in literature in compo sition in history in civics and in science hun dreds of thousands of copies weekly or monthly are so employed there is hardly a big uni versity in the west at any rate there are few small colleges which do not employ them in class room work and the number of high schools in which they are used runs into thou sands under the proposed system the ex pense to the students must be much greater and so their use will be less and their influ ence will be crippled he called attention also to the great amount of real education given by the magazines you shut off the farm journals as these proposed zone rates would shut them off and you decrease the productive power of this coun try by millions of dollars you shut off the trade journals and you decrease the manufacturing power of this coun try by many more millions you shut off the home periodicals and you shut off agencies that in the last few years have sent out elaborate personal expert individual instruction to hundreds of thousands of women on the care of their homes and their children just who would lose out the small town people the country people the cities would read anyway but the small towns and the rural districts depend to a large extent on newspa pers and magazines you shut them out from the freest possible circulation of ideas just at the time when that freest possible circulation is most essential i say as a college teacher a man who has been in the educational profession almost a gen eration that you could hardly stab nearer the heart of the nation than by stabbing at the coun try circulation of newspapers and magazines yet that is exactly where this zone system is directing the knife the zone system has been considered again and again and always condemned in 1906 a joint commission of congress on second class matter held voluminous hearings its report said in part neither for reasons almost equally obvious is a solution to be found in a zone system of charges which would artificially restrict the dif fusion of the periodical agencies of intelligence apart from the social and political considera tions which to our minds are conclusive there are serious administrative difficulties the proposal was again condemned by the hughes commission of 1912 charles e hughes president a lawrence towell of by alice stone blackwell harvard and harry wheeler president of the chicago chamber of commerce they said the policy of zone rates was pursued in the early history of our post office and has been given up in favor of a uniform rate in view of the larger interests of the nation as a whole it would seem to the commission to be entirely impracticable to attempt to establish a system of zone rates for second class matter yet this is what has been done by a para graph hastily added to a revenue bill at the eleventh hour without any general knowledge of the fact by the public it is the culmination of a series of hardships to which the papers have been subjected first the price of news print paper was enormously increased owing to an alleged shortage the government investigated and pronounced it to be a sham shortage but meanwhile the exor bitant rates charged had driven hundreds of papers out of existence ever since the gov ernment has been trying vainly off and on to stop the profiteering on news print paper and one periodical after another goes on suspending publication or consolidating there are now large cities with only one morning paper and the number of such cases is increasing it is important that people should be able to read both sides of every important question and it is growing harder and harder for them to get the chance we see in russia what happens when people are left uninformed and we see in ger many the still worse results that follow when they are systematically misinformed the zone rates of postage tend directly to produce such a result putting training to use t is gratifying to see in the enfranchised states women who were active in the work for equal suffrage now putting their experience to use in working for other good things why did you name your boy reginald clar ence somebody is said to have asked a cer tain man the father answered because i wanted him to be a fighter 1 figure that in our neighborhood a boy named reginald clar ence has got to fight the woman sueragists were given a bad name through no fault‘of their own and for years they had to fight an uphill battle against a strong and unscrupulous opposition it has developed their powers and given them insight and skill in the best methods of combatting the forces of evil almost all of which have been ar rayed against equal rights now the training acquired in that long warfare comes in usefully to enable them to lead in other lights for the public good too much states rights he waning prestige of the doctrine of states rights has received a severe blow from the recent decision by the u s supreme court that the national child labor law is un constitutional the decision is rcgretted by practically everyone except exploiters of child labor the court was divided five to four to the lay mind is seems especially unfortunate that an excessive regard for states rights on digitized by the part of one aged man should have the power to condemn thousands of the nation’s children to physical breakdown and early death the war has taught us the need of nationaliz ing many things that used to be looked upon as matters of state or local concern the child la bor decision is so obviously in condict with the public weal that it should be a lesson to every one on the folly of carrying zeal for states rightsto an extreme we hope the lesson may be heeded by certain u s senators who be lieve in woman suffrage but have been intend ing to vote against the federal amendment on states rights grounds a swan song he anti suffrage league of england has disbanded and the anti sufrage review has ceased publication its closing issue gives an account of the final meeting of the council several notable addresses were made it says and mrs humphry ward’s is quoted at length it may be called her swan song on this par ticular topic she said in part we have come to take leave of each other at the end of a long fight the wave of grati tude towards the women of the country for the work which they had done was as we all know too strong to resist well the past is past and we have to look forward to the future and in no sense of having been beaten in any way which really matter to any individual here having fought our good fight and having been beaten in a long tight and on the whole a fair fight we must now look forward to the future and do the best we can to help our beloved country this assertion that the defeat does not really matter to any of them hardly squares with the impassioned declarations which mrs ward and her friends have been making for years as to the disastrous results that must follow the granting of votes to women over and over again they have assured parliament and the public that it would mean the ruin of the brit ish empire that ought to matter to every one of them it might be supposed the same lurid predictions were made up to the very end yet as soon as the light is over the smoke all clears away and the standard bearer of the op position tells her colleagues that their defeat is no great matter it is instructive that after the granting of the ballot the anti suffrage associations always dis solve although they have fervently declared their conviction that the vast majority of women are opposed and have sometimes asked for a straw referendum by women yet just as soon as the women get a right to vote on the question with authority the anti sutfragists as sume that their game is up and proceed to throw up the sponge it is the best thing they can do but if the majority of women were really opposed the game of the antis would not be up at all on the contrary they would be in a position to renew it with full assurance of victory but they invariably dissolve and though in new york they are still keeping up a feeble pretence of organization the antis of the empire state must soon follow those of the 361 empire imay they rest in peace 008 c june 15 1918 53 women in business he nomen’s national book association is a unique organization founded a few months ago in the interest of the women who are engaged in the book selling business and its allied lines publishers authors book buyers and book sellers women who have been dem onstrating for some time that there is no more of a sex line in the book business than in the ballot are members of the organization which has grown out of the desire of a number of women to promote greater efficiency in the merchandising of books and to give women their proper place in one of the most important of the country's industries the organization has closed its first season having celebrated the occasion at a banquet whkh was held during the national convention of the american booksellers association sev eral hundred men and women leaders in many avenues of endeavor which go to make up the book business were there in testimony to the tremendous growth of women’s influence in the industry from the time the manuscript leaves the hands of the author until it is placed in its finished form in the library of the reader it has not been so long ago that women first began to hold positions of importance in the book selling world but those days have given way to a new era in which women are join ing hands with men in making a better place for books in the world thirty eight women at tended one of the morning ses sions of the american book sellers convention and there is evidence that the number of women delegates will be greatly increased by the time of the next gathering the first year of the 0 men's national book associa tion has been a memorable and a busy one for the members of the association outstand ing features in the associa tion’s activities have been the social functions with their formal programs of speakers and the monthly gatherings held in the sunwise turn book shop where matters of mutual in terest to women booksellers have been threshed out in informal discussions there have been talks on such subjects as advertising the over head expense of book selling the art of selling books the mail order book business juvenile book questions and numerous other topics vitally interesting to the book trade these meetings have been an open forum for the mutual benefit of the women who have succeeded in estab lishing themselves as bona fide book sellers unlike many national associations which meet in disconnected units and are nationl in name only the women’s national book association is national in fact as well as in name the en tire proceedings of these fortnightly meetings are taken down in shorthand and the transcribed copies sent broadcast to every member of the association permitting them to enjoy a mail order participation in the meetings in this way distant chapters of the associatibn get the full mrs pauline c sherwood the making of books benefit of their membership and in turn are invited to give expression to their own ideas and make suggestions for the mutual benefit of the members of the association he association claims as its natal day no vember 13 1917 when fifteen keen visioned women alert to the opportunities offered women in the business of merchandising books met to gether and created the national association elected ofiicers and mapped out a busy year’s work the officers who have guided the des tinies of the association since its inception are mrs pauline c sherwood president miss lulu jacobs secretary miss h j pfanstiehl treasurer the chairman of the membership committee is miss e f widman of the pub licity committee miss martha kramer of the entertainment committee miss madge jenison mi ss lulu n o more enthusiastic member of the associa tion can be found than miss jenison who with mrs mary mowbray clark rules the affairs of the sunwise turn book shop where the national association has held many of its meet ings miss jenison’s enthusiasm about the ca pabilities of women jin the professional life of the country and the opportunities presented in the book trade together with the inspiration of the suffrage parade of last year which marked another red letter day on the calendar of women’s activities were responsible in a meas ure for the existence of the association miss jenison says that it was while every one was planning for the big suffrage parade last year that i discovered how unorganized were the women in the book selling profession i wanted to march in a group with members of my own profession but i discovered that there was no such organization this discovery set some of us to thinking and planning and out of this planning came the women’s national book association it was our idea to bring together in one unit all the allied professions of the book trade in order that greater scope and strength might be given the activities of women engaged in these various professions the assdciation can be made to serve as the mouthpiece and organ of the various units in all of the matters which are of common interest there is always a bond of mutual interest between the members of the various professions engaged in the making and selling of books the author the publisher the book seller are mutually interested in the success of each other’s work and it is our idea to get all three to gether for the discussion and consideration of common problems and matters of general inter est our plan‘of keeping each member of the association in close touch with the work of these meetings has contributed greatly to the solidar ity of the common interests of women in the book making and selling industry the re quests for membership are coming in so rapidly that it will not be long before the out of town members will be taking an active part in the planning of the year’s pro grams though they may be thousands of miles away our aim is to abolish distance in the building up of our organi zation a it was decided to make our programs exclusive women’s programs for a time at least and we have had many de lightful surprises in finding so many women holding positions of great responsibility in the various avenues of our pro fession we hope to bring to the front women who have achieved success in the allied field of books but who have been too modest to make known their achievements we shall probably adhere to the rule of having women speakers for some time as a means of stimulating greater interest in the work of the asoscia jacobs tion among the members themselves he women are demonstrating that they can stand by each other and are devel oping a spirit of professional pride which speaks well for the future of the members of the asso ciation our book store is a little more than two years old and we were the first women in new york city to open an exclusive book shop but women generally have stood by us splendidly i must say that in the beginning the publishers and the men who knew something of the book business were not encouraging in their esti mates of our projects they all agreed that an exclusive book shop would hardly pay we be lieved then that a book shop such as ours could succeed and we still believe it but an exclusive book store must be rightly handled to be a suc cess book selling is not mere commerce the more one understands human nature the better one is qualified to sell books if you regard books as ideas and ideas as equipment the whole face of the world changes for book selling 54 building the hospital units by anne hirst curry correspondent in france for the woman citizen below are german prisoners building

that of our state governor is keenly interested in the project and smoothes out suddenly arising dith culties with the hand of a magician the mayor of the town itself who is by the way enter taining a number of the unit at his home sug gested that the hospital buildings be located on grounds belonging to his estate which has been done waiting in paris during the days before we came here was not easy for it was not the paris our people back home know but a paris cold and damp rainy and chilled by day gloomy and unlit by night a paris bombed by the cannon sometimes at intervals of only fifteen minutes torn by bombs from the air dropped just around the corner or perhaps next dooi or in the very hotel hile our barracks are being completed the members of our unit are being put up in such accommodations as the town affords some are at the hotel several at a hostelry that was once a monastery others are at a third home opened to them and the rest of the members at the home of the mayor himself twice a day we meet at the hotel for luncheon and dinner there we report and the most inter esting report is of course the carpenter’s she french officer in charge of work is easily the star of this company though after we enter our own barracks it seems safe to pre dict the popularity of our dietitian the bal ancing of food rations in this part of the coun try will probably require all her skill for the sandy soil limits production and the transpor tation of foods even with our help is a seri ous one meantime the doctors are already busy dr formad and dr gregory have patients in the village under their care the one doctor in the german prisoners building oversea hospital in labouheyre france vicinity numbers five other towns in his dis trict like the circuit rider of old so assistance is welcome just saturday one of our ambu lances was used to convey a patient from her home to the temporary hospital of the village for an operation and the gratitude of the one village doctor was evident barracks for the refugees themselves are being erected here by the government by german prisoners again and the refugees are to be quartered among the inhabitants it seems until their barracks are completed oming down we passed hundreds of refu gees coming from we know not where and going to places stranger to them pitiful beyond words old men and women younger women never young men little children al most by the hordes little donkey carts baby carriages and small hand carts were used to convey whatever they had snatched in the rush of leaving household goods sometimes a pic ture a bit of clothing one company of them had been traveling for eleven days exhausted they were far from homes already destroyed by the enemy trudging along to experiences un tried and difhcult at best to strange faces and strange scenes with no news of son and brother no hope of news no real tomorrow to look forward to any service any aid one may give to allevi ate such suffering to ease and smooth the path for their tired feet surely it is little enough for one to do for france not like peace surgery war surgery is not much like peace sur gery writes dr anna sholly from the evacu ation hospital at chateau ognon where she and the other women doctors of her unit of the women’s oversea hospitals u s a are serv ing with french surgeons i and some other doctors have just finished working over a man so badly shot up that we have been picking little pieces of shell out of his liver and abdomen as i write the rain is coming into our quarters so fast that i have picked up my writing materials and moved twice al ready in st paul’s church london in april there was a commemoration service for the 350 british nurses who have laid down their lives during the war the woman citizen the kinship of perpet ual darkness rom miss lydia bushnell smith of east river conn comes the story direct to the woman citizen of the international home school for blind officers of which she is one of the promoters miss smith is living on the italian riviera where the school will be placed this school has for its aim the care and in struction of educated soldiers of small means during a period sutiicient for them to read and write by the braille system music etc in the hope of insuring to them mental resources for a future which would otherwise loom blank and miserable the building for the school is loaned by the italian government and the school has the hearty approval of signor orlando prime minister of italy as well as that of his recent predecessor signor boselli mr thomas nelson page writes of it it certainly should have the good will and sym pathy of all right thinking persons and i am sure will prove a great boon to those unfortu nates who have lost their sight in the service of their country the princess colonna di stigliano general and nobil donna caporale contessa manini and others are on the advisory committee miss smith writes the school is for the blind officers of all allied armies the work ingmen will have their hands trained and in this way gain mental occupation as well but the educated men of small means who are not able to have private care and instruction have nothing to look forward to but blank misery we are hoping to open up vistas for them and make it possible not only to give them mental resources but enable them to reproduce litera ture for others american women in italy as in france are doing their ultimate bit for the war we have decided to go without fires that we may have the more to give to the many suffering writes this correspondent from the chill of a house sun heated only i the army nurse hen war was declared the army nurse corps had 270 members and 170 re serves now the corps has 10,000 and antici pates an

this story from overseas in one of the recent attacks four nursing sisters were killed three while assisting their patients to greater safety the fourth was singing to a man whosemerves had been miser ably shattered and whom the new attack was driving into a spasm of agony the bomb caught her killing her almost instantly but the man for whom she had given her life as unhesitatingly as ever did soldier on the held was saved june 15 1918 your vote and your federal government by mary sumner boyd he institutions of local government touch you as an american citizen at every point and the laws of the state are the laws of your social life but except when you buy your stamps or receive your letters or pay directly or indirectly its comparatively light taxes your life in time of peace at least is touched but lightly by your federal government american federalism so called in contra distinction to european centralized govern ments is unique it is made up of two sover eignties that of the united states strictly limited in scope but within its field supreme over citizens and states alike and that of the states having wide scope in legislation and many functions but not at any point encroach ing upon the field covered by the united states american governments city state and nation are again in contrast to most of those of europe founded on written constitutions the simplest of these because the field of government is simplest is the constitution of the united states on its lines as a founda tion are modeled the more complex state governments articles i ii and iii of the constitution of the united states describe the frame of gov ernment and its powers the frame of government is a two chambered congress an executive the president with a vice president who is chosen simply in case of the president’s death and a judiciary he main legislative power is in the hands of congress i say main advisedly because the executive and judiciary have also a power over legislation which is becoming increasingly important the legislative powers of congress cover art i see 8 briefly summarized taxation interstate and foreign commerce war army and navy money postofi‘ice territories and district of columbia with par 18 the blanket power to make all laws necessary to carry into effect the powers conferred above bills to raise money must originate in the lower house house of representatives the sen ate has the power to impeach federal ofiicials and to pass upon certain acts of the executive running through all our american govern ments is the principle of the division of powers this is the reason that governments of city state and nation are divided into three parts in the british government the cabinet is practically part and parcel with the parliament while our president and our judiciary are entirely independent of congress at first the idea was that a governmental machine which was a unit might easily usurp power gradu ally it has come to be felt that the legislative body was the one which could do most dam age not by usurpation but by hasty legisla tion and the theory today is that these checks and balances will prevent hasty legislation this is where the legislativé power of the other two branches already referred to comes in the president’s legislative power consists in his annual message recommending legis lation in his right to veto legislation which can be passed over his head only by a two thirds vote and his power to call special ses sions to consider legislation he deems important a law being passed by congress and approved by the president may be taken by a citizen to the courts on the ground that it is unconsti tutional and will be wiped off the statute books 7 if it is so declared this power of judicial legislation is too big a subject to go into here it has become one of the most distinctive and important features of american government and though vexatious in some respects it tends to give permanency and stability to our laws besides this the power of the federal judiciary covers cases involving the relations of the fed eral government with states individuals or foreign countries esides his legislative powers the president has surprisingly broad powers for a democ racy art ii sec 2 and 3 and art i see 7 par 2 and 3 his executive work covers the carrying out of the law including the admin istering of the various business activities of the federal government this he does with the help of his cabinet made up of the secretaries of treasury state foreign affairs war army navy interior territories indian affairs etc commerce labor postoiiice and the attorney general the president is the commander in chief of the army in foreign affairs he is almost supreme though treaties must be ratified by the senate he appoints ambassadors and consuls with the approval of the senate nor does his power of appoint ment carrying with it a control of the policies of appointees end there for he chooses his own cabinet the judges of the supreme court and other federal oflicials to the number of at least 6,000 the president also has a judicial power the right to grant pardons or reprieves to federal prisoners this is a simple outline of a fairly simple government though a government big enough to employ some half million ofiicials the main body of these oflicials with the excep tion of presidential appointees have been since the eighties chosen by civil service examina tion only between five and six hundred fed eral officials are elective ere is where the voter comes in and he comes in at his best in state elections he has many local and state officials to decide on the number throughout the country is as against the few hundred federal elective offi cials about 100,000 in federal elections the voter has only the senator and congressman from his district and the president and vice prcsident this is what has been called the ideal short ballot namely few enough offi cials in large enough offices so that he may scrutinize their merits choose them intelli gently and hold them responsible for the way in which they carry on national affairs elections for the house of representatives congressmen whose members serve two years fall in even years in november except in the state of maine which votes 3 month earlier there are 435 members of congress apportionment being based on population not voters the united states census being taken 55 every ten years to readjust the apportionment senators serve six years but every two years one third of the membership goes out of oflice so there are senatorial elections in some states every two years there are two sen ators from each state the theory being that in the house weak states should have equal power with those strong in population until 1913 when the seventeenth amendment pro viding for popular election was added to the constitution senators were appointed by state legislatures the present method of election by the people is characteristic of the move ment of the last generation toward direct democracy the only important omcials of state or nation not now elected directly by the people are supreme court judges appointed by the president and the president himself who is chosen by electors chosen by the people this method of indirect election is cumber some often unrepresentative and sometimes unfair and will probably in timevbe changed in local and state governments the voter votes on men and measures in national mat ters there is no direct legislation he votes on no federal laws these are all passed by congress nor is there a popular referendum on amendments to the constitution state legis latures casting the referendum in this case in italy ur women in italy said count y

citizen the book stall awaiting development he american institute of social serv ice aroused against the anti suffrage charge that the collapse of finland and russia is in any sense due to the emancipation of women is running a series of articles on the woman question in its studies in social progress the series has not been entered into lightly or inadvisedly it is one of solid scholarship carried on by dr rudolph m binder pro fessor of sociology in n ew york university in the preliminary study which has already appeared dr binder opens lire at once upon the idea that the problem of woman is a side issue concerning a few advanced women only it is as much a problem for man as it is for woman and as much a matter of impor tance to society as it is to both of them in society there are only men and women and the way they settle their troubles decides the fate of the community the advance of woman is implicit in the principles of christianity dr binder believes n on christian lands have had very little trouble with the woman question for they have ignored it woman was put into subjection and kept there voila tout in christian lands nothing less than the per fect equality of men and women is possible a christian community cannot afford to with hold justice from women because they are co heirs with men of the kingdom of god professor binder’s review of the slow al most amusingly slow growth of the idea of equality will be familiar to sulfragists only gradually he says did the truth dawn upon the mind of males that the terms men in the phrase all men are created equal was inclusive not exclusive that it stood for human beings not for one sex only at first it was literally applied to men white men then to black men eventually to red men but not to women women have won their own place by their own prowess is conceded in dr binder’s survey there have always existed at least a few women of exceptional virility and mentality who by sheer force of their ability have forged ahead there is no prejudice strong enough to keep down real power permanently men have been amazed in this present war they have always been amazed at the aptitude and marked ability among women modern branches of knowledge have demonstrated says this student of sociology that heredity does not run along sex lines girls inherit the ability of father or mother just as boys do or they do not just as boys do not the summing up of dr binder’s argument for the perfect political equality of women is that woman has proved her case as far as abil ity inheritance and etiiciency are concerned the world needs the power of women as it needs all real power there is too little of it as it is and society needs all of it where women have been given political equality no evil and much good has been recorded if history and present observations are of any value says dt binder they indicate that a vast storehouse of talents is waiting for development through the emancipation of women about girls he club worker a modest monthly magazine has just appeared in new form it is published by the national league of nom en workers with headquarters at 35 east thirtieth street new york city and is

most of it from nurses on the field digitized by 600816 june 15 1918 the woman and the calling v’en in the central powers there is tes timony to a recognition of the changed economic status of women and the desirability of doing away with all discrimination against women in industrial and professional fields a writer in the n eues wiener journal points out that one of the maxims which hold good be cause never subjected to repeated examination is that which is embodied in the notion that female labor reduces wages the notion is true in so far as the fa'ct of lower wages comes about through the large and cheaper supply of women for work away with female labor that is ruining us this became the slogan of a struggle for existence though achieved any success women have worked on calmly for the lower wages because they would have found no other employment and the strug gle between the sexes there is nothing uglier than the struggle between man and woman because by nature they should love and com plement each other this struggle i say be came a conflict in the field of pay instead of a competition in respect of ability the ex traordinary conditions which have now been going on for years have thrown the man not the woman out of the competition and it now appears that the blame for the general re duction of wages and salaries does not fall upon women as such but at most upon the flooding of the labor market by the influx of women entirely apart from the depreciation of money women's incomes have risen consider ably since women no longer feel that necessity of underbidding which men imposed upon them as by a right hereditary to males the change becomes most obvious when we take the men who have remained in their positions and compare their salaries increased to be sure but only on account of the general in crease of the cost of living with the increased incomes of many women this change has come about not only through the lack of work ing people an opportunity has at last been given to women to develop and to reap the money value of their ability in many fields that were formerly closed to them in this respect all women employed by mer cantile firms have had the happiest experiences formerly they were engaged in subordinate ohice work almost exclusively and without any regard for their abilities now many capable women occupy positions which require inde pendent judgment often even administrative ability the ardently desired change in the employment of women is at last a fact and a salary of 500 to 6m crowns 100 to 120 a month is nowadays no rarity fora woman who before the war earned about 120 crowns 24 and who by now under normal conditions a might have been raised to 150 crowns 30 it is indeed interesting that hardly a single wom an oould in her former position have attained such a disproportionate increase in wages as is now the case women often used to be put into positions that only a man had held but without a corresponding wage but the time came when all the sentimental considerations of tradition and custom had to be thrown overboard changes for the better which amount to several thousand crowns a year are not to be set it never aside lightly and managers who released their old capable women workers on account of slow accommodation to the new valuation of female labor had to pay the new inexperienced work ers the same amounts that they were unwilling to give to the old employes extraordinarin high are the salaries paid now to capable wom en stenographers who by the way are not nearly so common as people think the in telligent stenographer who can take dictation and put it through a typewriter rapidly has be come the most popular kind of a private sec retary she must discharge a lot of business requiring intelligence stenography and type writing are only a part of the activity of these women who earn 500 crowns 100 a month it has also happened we cannot say whether by chance or as a result of the trend of the times that those women in public offices whose training equals that of their male col leagues are on absolutely the same footing with i the men in regard to both salary and promo tion a woman who teaches in a middle school can attain to a‘salary of 10,000 crowns 2,000 a year and this salary can be brought up by private tutoring to a very respectable annual income a woman of academic training who is engaged in the ofiice of some ministry has the way open to her theoretically to the rank and perquisites of a court councilor and in the professions the constellations are still more favorable at the present time vienna has women doctors who earn an annual income of 30,000 to 40,000 crowns 6,000 to 8,000 employes in exclusively feminine occupa tions are enjoying the benefits of the present juncture only in so far as they are receiving wages that are higher in proportion to the gen eral increase in the cost of living the servant girl can hardly buy with her wages of 60 crowns 12 what she formerly obtained for her monthly income of 20 or 30 crowns 4 or 6 and the capable seamstress who form erly earned 5 crowns 1 a day does not profit from the fact that she is now getting 9 crowns 1.80 but there are women tailors who now do so called men’s work and who earn indeed disproportionately more than they used to earn it looks very much as if the future not too far distant we hope will see women com plaining because the competition of men is re ducing wages and salaries but perhaps the men will be so proud as to despise this one time expedient of the women and let ability alone decide the competition in this case that which exceptional circumstances have created might become the normal namely that those who are capable in accomplishment will earn 5 much and the less useful will earn little whether one happens to be a man or a wom an ought not to afford a basis of discrimina tion let georgiana do it the time has come when we do not say let george do it when

addition these women had reached the age of 25 and had undergone three years of actual industrial ex perience war exigencies says the committee on public information will make it necessary for many factories where the majority of workers are men to have women employment managers industrial experience proves that employment problems can best be solved by having a separate organization in a

ways in which every la suffragist can help is to spread this feeling 0 optimism this mutual interest among her circle of friends you are all agreed we hope that the most emcient method of encouraging

world hen the president of the united states in his war message to congress april 2 1917 said we shall light to make the world safe for democracv he uttered an apothegm which rang round the world until then no one had expressed that thought italy and portugal the nations unexpectedly in the white house washington d c to the m emorialists of france great britain belgium ha v e read your message with the deepest interest i and i welcome the opportunity to say that i agree without reservation that the full and sincere democratic reconstruction of the world for which we are striving and which we are determined to bring about at any cost will not have been completely or adequately attained the united states the presi dent the congress and the press with their acclaim of war for democracy introduced a new and a higher spirit into the world controversy confused thinking was replaced by a definite objec tive a standard of aim and ideal was volved in a life and death strug gle had had little time to analyze causes they could only compre hend that a savage wolf was at their throats two years of war had clarified the whole world around situation and men had begun to see that whatever had been the causes which led the world into the war the conflict was rapidly resolving itself into a clash between systems of gov ernment the rule by kings and the rule by people the president’s happy aphorism defined in a sentence what all ob servers were beginning to under until women are admitted to the suffrage and that only by that action can the nations of the world realize for the benefit of future generations the full ideal force of opin ion or the full humane forces of action the services of women during this supreme crisis of the world’s history have been of the most signal useful ness and distinction the war could not have been fought without them or its sacrifices endured it is high time that some part of our debt of gratitude to them should be acknowledged and paid and the only acknowledgment they ask is their admission to the sufrage c an we fustly refuse it as for america it is my earnest hope that the senate of the united states will give an unmistakable answer to this question by passing the sufrage amendment to our federal constitution before the end of this session c ordially and sincerely lifted on high which put new life hope and cheer into a war weary world still women did not feel that they had any part in it at all ex cept that of service and sorrow it was a man’s war for man’s rights then great britain compre hended and gave the vote to women the royal assent being 1918 canada followed and gave the granted on february 6 vote to women from ocean to ocean and from the arctic snows to the border line of the united stand and brought conjectures signed about the war aims to a speedy focus by degrees all the belligerents adopted the saying as a war maxim but something infinitely more important happened when the united states went to war than giving the world a new slogan the president’s cue was picked up by congress and repeated in a hundred speeches it was passed on to the thousands of jour nalists waiting with sharpened pencils in niewspapers dailies weeklies and monthlies big and small important and otherwise the nation responded to the cue and proclaimed from ocean to ocean that in truth it was a war for democracy to which our people dedicated all that we have and all that we are states the royal assent being vvoodrow vvilson h granted on may 23 1918 now mr wilson in his message to the women of many nations on june 13 1918 declares the full and sincere democratic reconstruction of the world for which we are striving and which we are determined to bring about at any cost will not have been completely or adequately attained until women are admitted to the suffrage the world awaits the action of the united states senate which will come soon when it gives to the world by the passage of the federal suffrage amendment its pledge of sincerity that we are in truth fighting for democracy then the women of all the allied nations will realize that although it may have begun as a man’s war for the freedom men it ht resolved itself into digitized by 66 a war of liberation for humanity they will know that it is their war too they will feel for the first time that when they give all that they have and all that they are they do it in the glad exaltation that women who come after them will share in the distribution of blessings as they have shared in the distribution of sacrifices great britain canada the president the house of representatives the national committees of all parties have spoken the world now waits upon the senate sixty two sen ators too have spoken thirty four are to be heard from is it a man's war or a people’s war is it for men’s liberty or human liberty that all the world is in sad travail gentlemen for the answer to this question the world with bated breath c c c awaits women of europe to president wilson hen histories of nations are written and the story of the world’s freedom reaches full measure june 13 1918 will stand forth memorably it was the day on which an appeal from the women of the allied nations was presented to the presi dent of the united states these women called upon him to be their spokesman and to proclaim the principle of woman suf frage one of the fundamental rights of the future in their memorial to the president the european women who addressed him reverted to the unforgettable formulae which he had declared and urged him to address to all humanity his recoinmitment to woman suffrage in one of his declarations which resound throughout the world the stirring appeal can be read in full below the memorial to the president union f rancaise pour le suerage des femmes addresse de la presidente paris 14 rue pierre charron secretariat paris 53 rue scheffer paris february i 1918 to his excellency the president of the united states 6 n the historic message which announced to the world the 1 entry into the struggle of american force and thought you declared unforgettable formulae upon which your great republic awaits a victory the right of peoples to self determination and a durable peace for generations to come i the french suffragists and those of the allied countries have heard your beautiful and strong words and they unite in prayer to you for the accomplishment of the following resolution considering that from this war there has come a new inter national right founded upon the right of peoples to self determi nation that nothing can be claimed to speak authoritatively in the name of the people which excludes women from the life of nations considering moreover that women during the actual con fiict have shown the value of the social work which they are capable of performing the woman citizen considering that the participation of wives and mothers in the suffrage would be the greatest guarantee of the peace to come the need that the belligerent countries have of their help in the present confiict the sufferings moral as well as physical which this war has cost them have given definite proof that no longer without iniquity and imprudence can one refuse to give them through their vote an infiuence in the undertakings which decide peace and war the women of the allied countries express the wish that president wilson in one of his future messages will proclaim the principle of woman suffrage one of the fundamental rights of the future we have read with emotion in the woman citizen m r president the very profound words which you have spoken in response to the delegation of women from new york if we recite them here it is because they are the same words that we would ask you to address to all humanity in one of your declara tions which resound throughout the world it is a struggle which goes deeper and touches more of the foundation of the organized life of men than any struggle that has ever taken place before and no settlement of the questions that lie on the surface can satisfy a situation which requires that the questions which lie underneath and at the foundation should also be settled and settled right i am free to say that i think the question of woman suffrage is one of those questions which lie at the foundation i beg you to accept mr president the expression of our great appreciation of our american sisters and our profound ad miration for the high moral tone of the declarations which you have uttered in their name it is this which encourages us to ask your aid which will be a powerful influence for woman suf frage in the entire world for the committee of the union francaise pour le sufrage des femmes and in the name of other

missouri secretary of the congressional digitized by 600816 june 22 1918 committee and miss rose young director pf the leslie bureau of suffrage education and editor of the woman citizen after an informal interview thepresident presented to mrs catt his reply to the memorialists as given on the preceding page it was the first time in the history of the fight for the federal suerage amendment that the president has publicly indi cated his desire for the senate’s favorable action during the present session and suffragists the country over have been heart ened by his renewed advocacy of the passage of the amendment 67 senate has already passed the bill and this committee is here today to consider it in the days of the monarchy hawaiian women took great interest and could be effectively active in politics their men fully appreciate the wisdom public spirit and executive ability aof women but since hawaii became a territory of the united states they have been obliged to take their place beside their unenfranchised american sisters the most interesting and amazing thing about the passage of the hawaiian bill is the fact that in both senate and house the suffrage in hawaii he hawaiian suffrage bill has now passed senate and house and received the president’s signature the national american voman suffrage association believing that its mission is to secure the vote for women in any part of the world over which the stars and stripes wave has sponsored and aided this bill and counts its passage as another victory to which its forces have contributed the bill provides that the legislature of hawaii is with power to do one of two things either to enfranchise the women of the islands by direct stattitory enactment or to submit the question of woman suffrage to the voters of the territory of hawaii in other words the congress of the united states wipes out the provisions of the original ac_t creating the territory of hawaii which restricted the right to vote to male citizens and grants the legislature of hawaii authority to take action to ex tend the vote to women how hawaii will receive this freedom is best predicted by mrs benjamin f pittman of boston in her address before the house committee on woman suffrage hin interest in the hawaiian suffrage bill apart from my deep interest in the enfranchisement of all women comes as you have heard through my husband’s connection with hawaii his mother who was kenole chieftess of hilo was a woman of great infiuence among her people i refer to this only to show you how i a stranger and an american was in a position to feel the pulse of the hawaiian people in regard to the enfranchisement of their women it was known in hawaii that i am greatly interested in this subject and almost immediately upon my arrival i was asked to hold suffrage meetings i did this and soon learned that i was in a suffrage country and that the suffrage bill had been approved by both the republican and democratic parties it was my privilege to be present at the opening of the legis lature and i was able to interview members of both houses every man to whom i spoke including the president of the senate and the speaker of the house expressed himself as in favor of the measure the legislature had passed an over whelming vote for woman suffrage and the delegate from hawaii to congress had been commissioned to lay the bill before this body but there it stopped as far as they knew i promised the i reported to my vested women of hawaii to inquire into the matter chief mrs carrie chapman catt the president of the national merican w'oman suffrage association with the result that the bill aroused no hostility those gentlemen who never have failed to see the bulwarks of civilization tumbling about their ears whenever and wherever the subject of giving votes to the women of their own state and nation is raised sat strangely quiet when the proposal to grant facilities for action to hawaii was under consideration not many weeks ago when senator jones asked unanimous consent for a vote on the federal suffrage amend ment certain senators arose in wild eyed alarm to object and consent was not given but these same senators sat calmly silent when the question of giving votes to women of a different race was before them and in neither senate nor house was a roll call taken it is certainly difficult to understand the mental opera tions of such senators but passing that problem to the psychia trists we congratulate the women of hawaii upon the opening of the door which leads to their enfranchisement we venture to hope that gentlemen of the polynesian race will be more prompt than men of the aryan have been to share their political freedom with their women by this act the territory of hawaii is given an authority no state in the union possesses it can give the vote to its women by statute without a referendum the territory of alaska was given such power and its legislature promptly extended the vote to women as its first act without a dissenting voice wyoming when a territory gave women the vote in 1869 by legislative enactment utah when a territory took similar action but the u s congress aiming to stamp out polygamy availed itself of its veto power over territorial legislation and summarily dis franchised the women of that territory washington territory enfranchised its women by legislative enactment but the saloons engineered a case up to the state supreme court claiming that the legislature had no power to grant the vote the supreme court was composed of judges appointed by the president and as grover cleveland was then president they were appointed from the south which at that time was very backward in its education on the question of woman suffrage the case pre cluded the friends of suffrage from carrying it to the u s supreme court and the supreme court of the nation never has passed upon the right of territories to enfranchise women by legislative enactment arizona’s legislature passed a woman suffrage measure but the governor vetoed it hawaii has not only plenty of good ex amples to emulate but congress has clearly granted its legisla ture the right to enfranchise its women by direct legislation c c c digitized by 600816 the woman citizen the back yard of the war jill moving into the new barracks of the women’s oversea

collection of letters from a valiant young french captain a soldier unafraid letters by captain andré cornet auquier edited and translated with an introduction by theodore stanton little brown 8 co boston w'ritten in the trenches of the alsatian front to his family at home they give us a graphic picture of the life of the poilus a fresh realization of the spirit in which the french are fighting and last but not least a glimpse into the heart of a remarkable and lovable man captain andré cornet auquier had led his class at school and college both in scholarship and conduct and was universally beloved when the war broke out he was a young professor he soon showed himself a brilliant soldier rose from grade to grade and was decorated by joffre who said of his regiment with the trdops of the twentieth corps they are the best i have ever seen he was adored by his men as he had been by his students under his inspiration they gained the name of the lions he was over fiowing not only with loving kindness but with fun and when hardships weighed heavily he went around playing off jokes cheering every body up and making them laugh no creature was too small to share his kindness the other day i found in an abandoned house on the firing line two pretty kittens whose mother had been killed he wrote home they were thin and could scarcely walk i adopted the poor little orphans fed them with milk and now they are perfect pictures of health and beauty i brought them here in my haversack and one of them made his entry into this village at the head of the company on the shoulder of one of my troopers his parents and sister and a deep sense of the im portance of the cause for which the allies are fighting he said ve labor for tomorrow in order that there may be no more wars no more spilling of blood no more killing no more wounded no more mutilated victims we labor we whom our mothers will so weep for in order that other mothers may never know these bitter tears what are our lives worth when we think of the years of happiness and peace of those who will follow us an enthusiastic lover of natural beauty of poetry and song he was also sincerely and deeply religious i try every day to make myself more worthy by asking what jesus would have done in my place he writes his physical life was as clean as his intellectual and spiritual existence says the preface he detested obscene stories and at twenty eight could say of himself if i am killed i shall hand back my body to god as pure as i received it from him at my birth there is a touch ing story of a girl placed in a situation of much temptation who appealed to this young officer for advice and help she said i felt that you were not like the others the pastor who conducted his funeral said he did not admit that there were two systems of morals one for men and another for women a truth letters breathe devoted love for his by alice stone blackwell even the smallest human right denied is large the fact that the ruling class withhold this right is prima facie evidence that they deem it of importance for good or for evil s b a how like most of this is to what is going on among women in the united states and yet there is a difference the women's papers from each country have a fiavor of their own like the fragrance of different flowers in a garden but all of them are flowers unfolding towards the sun of freedom t anti feminism and free love which has been perceived by the most high minded men of all nationalities theodore stanton elizabeth cady stanton’s eldest son has rendered a real service in translating these letters for the american public he says that the letters written home by a multitude of young french soldiers breathe a splendid spirit a porto rican colleague he woman suffrage movement has now spread to almost every part of the civil ized world one of the pleasant things con nected with editing a suffrage paper is the re ceipt of periodicals from many different coun tries and printed in many different languages all advocating the same cause there lies before me as i write a magazine published in spanish at san juan porto rico la muier del sigle xx the twentieth cen tury woman it is edited by mercedes sola and the name of the founder is given as ana rogue de duprey looking it over it is in teresting to see how many of the same things are occupying women’s minds in porto rico as in the united states the main preoccupation of women there as here is with the children the leading article deals with a new law lengthening _the school year from nine months to ten and providing that the public schools shall open on august 5 the editor says that this law is well meant but that its framers did not take account of the porto rican climate according to her july august and september are months of overpowering heat during which the children cannot study many mothers are said to be seriously alarmed and the modification of the law is advocated other articles

world today is the kaiser the most powerful group of anti sutfragists is the pots dam gang who are responsible for the present devastation of the world american anti sueragists have always been in bad company excellent and well meaning as many of them are in aligning themselves against equal suffrage they have had to line up perforce with the liquor and vice interests with the exploiters of child labor with the men who live by corrupt politics and with all the reactionary interests in general now they find themselves lined up also willy willy with the kaiser and the prussians another curious combination has come about the german government is reported to be en couraging in every way the birth of illegitimate children on a colossal scale monogamy will not create cannon fodder fast enough so in or der to be ready for future wars it is said that polygamy is to be established the less honorable among american anti suf fragists have long been trying to convince peo ple that feminism means free love and have pointed with glee as proof of it to any for eign philosopher or any obscure lottie mont gomery in this country who wrote in oppo sition to the present code of social ethics now here is the great ally of the antis the world’s champion anti feminist the kaiser constituting himself also the world’s champion promoter of illegitimacy l if the kaiser were a sutfragist the ameri can opponents of equal rights for women would claim the fact as conclusive proof that fern inism meant free love and that all the suf frage hosts in america from mrs catt down were consciously or unconsciously working for the destruction of christian marriage but the anti suffragists would never admit for a mo ment that that rule should work both ways why waste women’s time ontana has a lively woman in its legislature mrs maggie smith hath away she is a patriot and is the chairman of the four minute men in her community besides doing a great deal of war work she writes how men can refuse to grant to the peo ple of the nation a chance to decide the ques tion of woman suffrage for themselves is a mystery to me and everyone else women are doing their full part in the service of war and will continue to do it but if they could be relieved from the necessity of using energy to get what is rightfully theirs they could do much more how it happens that any senator of the united states can fail to see and realize this fact is an enigma to the west digitized by 600816 june 22 1918 73 women of illinois carry on lthough women of illinois have won a large measure of enfranchisement for themselves they are not going to pause until they have carried on the cause of suffrage to the enfranchising of every woman in america it took several pages of the congressional record of june 7 to chronicle the petitions and memorials with which senator james ham ilton lewis had been charged by his constitu ents among these were resolutions from the chicago woman’s city club expressing the conviction that the women of the nation now need the completest political liberty the franchise in the hands of women means the development of a large group of citizens for civic righteousness these women sub mitted and added that even now in chicago women are hampered by limitation of their franchise from their proper civic activity believing that women have already demon strated their loyalty to the government and that the crisis of the world now demands that all their energies be utilized for the good of the nation they urged senator lewis to con tinue his efforts in behalf of the speedy passage of the federal suffrage amendment hat the american republic will not deny its women the political liberty that mon archies have extended already to 40,000,003 women enfranchised since the war

of the seventh eighteenth twenty third and twenty fifth wards of chicago in their resolution they declared that the country needs the votes of loyal women and urged the immediate passage of the fed eral amendment their plea was also based on the urgent needs of the country that all the energies of women be released from the struggle for their own political freedom in adding its voice to the general appeal the abraham lincoln center class in religious study declared that in asking for the passage of this amendment we are simply asking for the obvious demands of reason justice and economic efhciency delay they added is to refuse a place in the advance line of civiliza tion like the former groups these pleaders asked to have it read into the congressional record that the women of illinois are proud that they have representing them in congress two men who believe that justice and liberty should be extended to all regardless of sex anville illinois women massed to gether to

formed hopes of a democracy yet to come into a living active conviction many nations and many millions of people are resolved to make this the last world war and they know so bold an aim can only be accomplished when systems of government cen tered about kings and kaisers are gone forever republics do not seek world empire they do not wage war for indemnities and gain they do not deal in international intrigue and fill other lands with paid spies and plotters intelligent people of all lands are rapidly dividing in conse quence into two classes the progres sives who having lost their con fidence in kings look forward to representative government constitu tions elections votes for the people as the safest form of government and the reactionaries who afraid of the people cling to kings edicts dictation caste ceremony and a subservient population the issue is growing clearer day by day how far the impulse to democracy has permeated the peoples of the world no one knows but that it has gone far and will go further is proved by overwhelming evidence or more than a century the united states has been the world leader in democratic progress it has pointed the way and blazed the trail for all the peoples of earth our fore fathers had the foresight to conceive and to establish a representative government when most great men of all nations denounced the idea as visionary and impractical they brave ly led on still in combat with world preju dice and made ours the first country to en franchise the jew the catholic the non land holder the alien the working man our re public gave the theory and also the proof of its trustworthiness in practice it demonstrates that a republic is a system of checks and bal ances wherein the virtuous the wise the tem perate neutralize the evil minded the foolish the extremist and thus not only makes a popu lar government safe and sound but inciden tally supplies an educational influence which uplifts the entire people a despairing world would not now turn with rising hope to the possible transforma tions of monarchies into republics as a safe guard against world war had'not the united states lived down the world’s doubts and ob jections and offered a proved example the united states entered the war because its ideals were jeopardized it bore insults and violations of treaties and witnessed the undoing of innocent peoples by ruthless dep redations but it did not decide to fight until it was clear that the war had resolved itself into a death grapple between the systems of autocracy and those of democracy so to make the world safe for democracy to prevent one nation from dictating the insti tutions of every other our republic went into the war and entered it too with a will to give military strategist ments elsewhere man ears this time will germany get the news certainly because the kaiser is fighting to make the world safe for autocracy and he knows that its only real menace is democracy by carrie chapman gatt war aims find out what your enemy wants you to do and then don’t do it find out what he doesn’t want you to do and then do it is a saying credited to more than one great what does the kaiser dread more than armies or navies a democratic uprising in ger many which will have no place in its scheme of things what will induce such an uprising the infection which will reach the germans through the spread of such move the german papers did not print the news that great britain had enfranchised its last class of men who heretofore had not had the vote about two millions in number and that it had enfranchised its women about six million in number why the kaiser had planned to deny one man one vote to prussian men and he feared the infectious influence of such news and the censors suppressed it extends the vote to women will germany be permitted to get the news n 0 not through the ordinary channels for no news of the spread of democracy must reach ger i f it refuses to extend the vote to women at why all that we have and all that we are and to see it through to its final victory even though it shall take a generation but what is the democracy for which the world is battling and‘for which we offer our man power our woman power our money power our all government of the world by consent of the individual nations government of the nations by consent of the individual people nothing more never less the united states stands for the autonomy of the small nations the little peoples that have been the pawns upon the royal chessboard of kings for a thousand years it stands for their incon testable right to govern themselves in their own way without fear of their neighbors it stands for the right of dependent lands to decide for themselves whether they will be independent and if not to what larger power they will choose to be attached these are our war aims our ideals they are worth fighting for and worth dying for the future peace and welfare of the world depend upon the result all these aims call for votes there can be no self determination of peoples as to their form of government without votes who is to cast them the nobility the landed aris tocracy a few men or the people our coun try professes to mean the people but does it is it sincere is our own nation governed by consent of the people no the enfranchisement of women is far more obviously inevitable today than was the en franchisement of the working man a hundred years ago yet our republic has hesitated floundered avoided and evaded the issue while other nations apparently of clearer vision and of braver temper have seized the banner of leadership so long borne by our country and they not we are now marching at the head of the world procession of democracy great britain and canada have each en when the united states digitized by 600816 franchised their women within a year and have freed their suffrage armies from the burden of future cam paigns while at the same time they have given to the world a pledge of their honesty that they are fighting democracy’s battle great britain gave the vote by the same bill to two millions of men who had never had the vote before years ago australia and new zealand had enfranchised men and women on equal terms and wherever the british flag flies there is some form of suffrage for women the scandinavian countries finland norway denmark iceland have al ready given universal suffrage to men and women the king of sweden has recommended and the majority party has pledged to make the partial suffrage long enjoyed by women in that country a complete suffrage the king of belgium has said that if ever his land is restored one of his first acts will be to give women the vote the french cham ber of deputies has promised women the vote the premier of italy has eloquently espoused the cause of suffrage and has pledged his party to extend women the vote processions of petitions and even street riots in hun gary have demanded the vote for men and women and it has been partially promised may 1,1918 the provincial government of russia before it was overturned by anarchy included women in the voting electorate as a matter of course the question of votes for women has even been discussed in the german reichstag these facts are but signs and symptoms of the widespread change in thought and theory of government throughout the world each new pronouncement of leaders or parties or nations for man or woman suffrage stimu lates the further extension of democratic feel ing everywhere and brings nearer the victory for the powers of progress no action has been taken by any allied country since the war began which has checked or discouraged the spread of democratic ideals on the contrary after definite promises from the kaiser of franchise reform for men the prussian par liament diet defeated the proposal on may 2 1918 by a vote of 235 to 181 it was an act characteristic of the forces of darkness he world expects america to be true to her ideals to live up to the noble war aims she has set for herself in all governments truly republican men are nothing principle is every thing said daniel webster the principle which has been the mainstay of our progress is representative government but ours will only become representative when all of the people give consent to the representatives entrusted with the law making and law

for a clear cut ideal but the ideal must have no flaws ours has as a nation we profess to stand for the annihilation of world political despotism but a nation does not think clearly nor act logically when upon one hand it declares against the divine right of kings and makes war upon the king business as an intolerable usurpation of authority yet on the other hand maintains the divine right of

certain force which can permanent ly destroy autocrzlcy and militarism democ racy great britain and canada have given the pledge of their sincerity in a war for democ racy why should the great republic balk hat does the great republic fear german men are military slaves and ger man women mere door mats said an american man the other day contemptuously perhaps they were yesterday but what of tomorrow germany is dependent upon her man power at the front but she is equally dependent upon her woman power at home women doubtless are fooled by the kaiser’s carefully guided pub licity and believe as do the men that they are engaged in a war of defense but there are at least two millions of german mothers and two millions of german wives or sweethearts who mourning the death of their loved ones are asking in the midst of their war wearinesn whether there is no better way of running a world than by the murder of war send them a ray of hope and send it now it will brighten one day

the govern ments of these countries do not hesitate to demand their utmost assistance several of our allies have recognized the war work of women by the enfranchisement of women and others promise to do so soon women of these united states find it difficult to explain why a government which rests explicitly upon the consent of the governed should lag behind other governments less purely democratic in its recognition of the rights of women to argue that the senate should not take a few hours of its valuable time to consider this supremely important question is to lack appreciation of the fundamentals at the basis of this war as a matter of fact very little time need be taken in the senate for debate the women of this state urge that the vote be taken at an early date and that the

of upholding the ideals of democracy tions many employers preferred to take un trained girls at a pittance train them into skilled workers and keep them at a low wage because they did not understand their own value for years this pioneer institution fought the economic battle of women turning out each year a group of skilled workers and demanded a living wage for them employers came to see that both time and money were saved by the employment of workers previously trained and the demand for graduates was much greater than the school could supply in course of events this school was taken over by the city of new york and incorporated in the public school system so great was the demand for manual instruction that the building set aside for the purpose was not only overcrowded but entirely unable to accommodate the ever in creasing number of applicants then the city built a larger better equipped building to ac commodate 3,000 girls the call of the nation for women workers ever more

this action taken for the first time since the association was organized 41 years ago was said to be based on two motives the fact that women now have the vote thus making their interest equal to that

improved my memory in one evening the amazing experience of victor jones of course i place you mr addison sims of seattle if i remember correctly and i do re member correctly mr burroughs the lumberman introduced me to you at the luncheon of the seattle rotary club three years ago in may this is a pleasure in deed i haven’t laid eyes on you since that day how is the grain business and how did that amalgamation work out the assurance of this speaker in the crowded corridor of the hotel mcalpin compelled me to turn and look at him though i must say it is not my usual habit to listen in even in a hotel lobby he is david m roth the most famous memory expert in the united states said my friend kennedy answering my ques tion before i could get it out he will show you a lot more wonderful things than that before the evening is over and he did as we went into the banquet room the toastmaster was introducing a long line of the guests to mr roth i got in line and when it came my turn mr roth asked what are your initials mr jones _and your business connection and tele phone number why he asked this i learned later when he picked out from the crowd the 60 men he had met two hours before and called each by name without a mistake what is more he named each man’s business and telephone number for good measure i won’t tell you all the other amazing things this man did except to tell how he called back without a minute’s hesitation long lists of numbers bank clearings prices lot numbers parcel post rates and anything else the guests gave him in rapid order assess when i met mr roth again which you may be sure i did the first chance i got he rather bowled me over by saying in his quiet modest way there is nothing miraculous about my remembering anything i want to remem ber whether it be names faces figures facts or something i have read in a mag azme you can do this just as easily as i do anyone with an average mind can learn quickly to do exactly the same things which seem so miraculous when i do them my own memory continued mr roth was originally very faulty yes it was a really poor memory on meeting a man i would lose his name in thirty sec onds while now there are probably 10,000 men and women in the united states when writing to advertisers please mention the woman many of whom i have met but once whose names i can call instantly on meeting them that is all right for you mr roth i interrupted you have given years to it but how about me mr jones he replied i can teach you the secret of a good memory in one evening this is not a guess because i have done it with thousands of pupils in the first of seven simple lessons which i have prepared for home study i show you the basic principle of my whole sys tem and you will find it not hard work as you might fear but just like playing a fascinating game i will prove it to you he didn’t have to prove it his course did i got it the very next day from his publishers the independent corporation when i tackled the first lesson i sup pose i was the most sur rised man in forty eight states to fin that i had learned in about one hour how to re member a list of one hundred words so that i could call them off forward and back without a single mistake that first lesson stuck and so did the other six read this letter from c louis allen who at 32 years became president of a million dollar corporation the pyrene manufacturing company of new york makers of the famous fire extinguisher c now that the roth memory course is finished i want to tell you how much i have enjoyed the study of this most fas cinating subject i’sually these courses in volve a great deal of drudgery but this has been nothing but pure pleasure all the way through i have derived much bene fit from taking the course of instructions and feel that i shall continue to strength en my memory that is the best part of it i shall be glad of an opportunity to recommend your work to my friends mr allen didn’t put it a bit too strong the roth course is priceless i can absolutely count on my memory now i can call the name of most any man i have met before and i am getting better all the time i can remember any figures i wish to remember telephone numbers come to mind instantly once i have filed them by mr roth’s easy method street addresses are just as easy the old fear of forgetting you know what that is has vanished i used to be scared stiff on my feet because i wasn’t sure i couldn’t remember what i wanted to say now i am sure of myself and confi dent and easy as an old shoe when i get on my feet at the club or at a banquet or in a business meeting or in any social gathering perhaps the most enjoyable part of it all is that i have become a good conversa tionalist and i used to be as silent as a sphinx when i got into a crowd of people who knew things now i can call up like a flash of light ning most any fact i want right at the instant i need it most i used to think a hair trigger memory belonged only to the prodigy and genius now i see that every man of us has that kind of a mem oryhif he only knows how to make it work rig t i tell you it is a wonderful thing after groping around in the dark for so many years to be able to switch the big search light on your mind and see instantly every thing you want to remember this roth course will do wonders in your office since we took it up you never hear any one in our office say i guess or i think it was about so much or i forget that right now or i can’t remember or i must look up his name now they are right there

american vvoman'suffrage associa tion’s campaign for the federal suffrage amendment is going on unendingly a flank movement begun under its direc tion has just been completed whereby the enfranchisement of hawaiian women is assured on the initiative of representative raker of california the hawaiian suffrage bill known as house bill 4665 was passed by the lower house under a rules suspension and without a roll call on monday june 3 as the bill passed the senate last september the only remain ing formality following the house’s action is the signature of the president which will probably have been affixed before this is read the bill which was passed by both houses without a dissenting voice vests in the legislature of the territory of hawaii the power to provide that in all elections authorized to be held by the organic act of the territory of hawaii female citizens possessing the same qualificaitons as male citizens shall be entitled to vote the bill further provides that the legislature if it sees fit can submit the suffrage question to the voters of the territory as the hawaiian legislature has already twice manifested its sentiment on the subject of suffrage by memorializing congress to urge the passage of the bill it is taken for granted that the question will be immediately disposed of in hawaii by legislative action if the united states senate will now get into action on the federal suffrage amendment it will soon be as well worth while for an american woman to live on the main land as in one of our island possessions question and answer behind that

the world fierce resentment at its brutality and at its onrush had seized him but hallett wounded to the point of death having given youth and life in resistance to bestiality and lust of power had other eyes theirs is the kind of mitteleuropa that’s been done before said he we’ve got a vaster and more incredible empire to build than they a mitteleuropa let us say of the spirit of man no no doctor it’s we that are doing the impossible holding that thin line germany has dreamed a dream black as the pit of hell yes but a dream they’ve seen a vision a red bloody damned vision but a vision they’ve got a programme a rehearsed and abominable programme and they know what they want and we don’t know what we want not once since those terrible august days have we got down on our naked knees and prayed for anything more than just to be allowed to wake up and find it isn’t so how can we expect with a desire like that to stand against a positive and a flaming desire we’ve got to say black or white at last swer a question this time with a whole answer we’ve got to an the war began so long ago went on hallett so long be fore saraj'evo before bismarck and the lot of them were be gotten so many many years of questions put and half answers given in return questions questions questions of a power loom in the north counties of a mill hand’s lodging questions of a black man in the congo a french cripple in the streets of zabern questions of a girl asking for her vote on a hyde park rostrum whole questions half answered hungry questions half fed mutilated fag ends of questions piling up and piling up year by year decade after decade listen there came a time when it wouldn’t do wouldn’t do at all there came a time when the digitized by 600816 26 son of all those questions stood up in the world final unequivo cal naked devouring saying now you shall answer me you shall look me squarely in the face at last and you shall look at nothing else you shall take your hands out of your pockets and your tongues out of your cheeks and no matter how long no matter what the blood and anguish of it you shall answer me now with a whole answer or perish and what’s the answer the doctor wanted to know and hallett with vision spiritualized by his own supreme surrender to his vision gave him the answer an answer that is the very pith and marrow of woman’s struggle for political liberty not just hers but hers shared with every group and every class who have had to go forth to light for a right or justice denied them hallett’s answer to the doctor was the same as that of the girl on the hyde park rostrum the same as that of the soldiers of belgium the men at verdun the men at the marne it will said hallett because it’s a word that’s sound funny to you been worn pretty thin by so much careless handling it’s democ racy democracy the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government it may sound funny to the united states senators at vash ington who are obstructing the passage of the federal suffrage amendment but we again commend the word to their attention shall we please the kaiser cc ihen england gave suffrage to women why was the news not allowed to be published in germany said mrs carrie chapman catt in a recent public address because the growth of democracy inside the german empire is the enemy that the kaiser dreads more than he does the armies and navies of the world but if the u s senate should defeat the federal suffrage amendment that news would be published in all the papers of germany if a pronunciamento could go forth that it should never pass this would be the most welcome news of all to the kaiser is there any member of the u s senate who is really hanker ing just at present to bring joy to the kaiser’s heart a s b our legislators all through these anxious days the great guns firing in france have seemed to be pounding away at our own hearts i they have been pounding in many lessons one is the iniquity of the principle upon which both the german government and the american anti suffragists rely the doctrine that might makes right vith the echoes of the guns mingle the echoes of the appeal addressed to the reichstag a few months ago by three great organizations of german women representing all classes up to the present time germany stands in the lowest rank of nations as regards women’s rights during the war the coopera tion of the women in public life has unostentatiously grown from the woman citizen year to year until today the number of women engaged in various callings in germany exceeds the number of men the work they are doing includes all spheres of male activity without them it would no longer be possible to support the economic life of the people share in the building up and extension of the social order the does not this performance of duty involve the right to women protest against this lack of political rights in virtue both of their work for the community and of their worth as human beings in the demand for the democratization of german pub lic life our legislators do not seem even to admit the existence of women the women’s appeal was turned down with contempt do our senators want to proclaim to the world that in this matter they are of one spirit with the huns a s b the war on the children y the decision of the supreme court that the federal child labor law is unconstitutional the lines of child protection which have been built up with infinite patience for a generation it is as if the national child labor com mittee found itself confronted with a new battle of the marne have been penetrated and it will meet it undaunted the fact that an adverse decision was rendered by a majority of only one member and that four out of nine supreme court judges found for an adverse verdict is unfortunate for public patience since it will be hard for laymen to believe that another decision might not have had equal consti tutional authority the main point for consideration is first of all that the country can not afford to be without some such check upon the exploita tion of children as the federal bill offered we shall have to study the decision and then frame a new bill which will meet the objections which the court makes says professor samuel m lindsay of columbia university vice it is inconceivable that the 12,000 members of the child labor committee will allow the matter to chairman of the committee lapse there will be a continuation of the campaign for regula tion of child labor as soon as we can reorganize our forces this means of course that now when the country needs un divided devotion to the prosecution of the war a strong force must be deflected to the retaking of ground once held for the war makes trebly imperative the protection of the young and no one for a moment suspects that either the national committee or the mothers of the country will have their attention deflected from the imperative needs of the child workers of america for america here is a homely need in american hospitals especially in the small hospitals of little cities for nurses not red cross nurses but plain everyday nurses at the old task of alle viating human misery hundreds of them thousands of them are called for they are wanted in the lower ranks of the pro fession to shove up to the top the nurses qualified to go to france digitized by 600816 june 8 1918 for france wants only the best trained the graduates third year women at least but if there are not enough first and second year girls those already equipped will be held back for the civilian needs of the united states many people have not yet awakened to the fact that the circuit riding doctor is becoming a fact in america as well as in france whole counties in the thinly populated sections of the country are reported by the medical profession as being cared for by one man who chases his automobile up hill and down dale night and day to supply the needs of a huge territory the shortage in nurses is becoming alarming and hospital superintendents say there is no relief in sight so many girls are supporting families from which the bread winner has gone to the front that they cannot afford to give time to an unremunerative nursing job w'ho will care for the civilians and who will go on caring for the wounded after they leave the military hospitals i red cross nurses can’t do it all and there is no way to get to be a real red cross nurse except by the road of diligence and discipline the latest requirements for red cross nurses made public by the division on women’s war work of the com ability to speak french fluently age between 25 and 35 good physical condition and willingness to serve wherever they may be placed for one year women with brother father husband or son in service will not be taken for france nurses aids who have had only the short courses in home care of the sick and first aid given by the red cross women now being sent out as nurses aids at the request of the paris office of the red cross will not be used in american army hospitals the intention is to use them in civil work with the french pop ulation and the repatriates and in french hospitals where nurses aids have been used since the beginning of the war since all undergraduates can at best care only for civilians why not fill up the demands for nursing recruits in the hospitals here and leave shipping space for the best equipped women to go to france it may not be romantic to take care of measles and adenoids and broken legs in america but it is terribly necessary to know how to do it as a passport to france and the thing that‘makes a good soldier out there is learn ing how over here mittee on public information are neither will those be taken even as omitting telephone girls 0 mitting telephone girls is getting to be habit a seriously bad habit a certain suffrage headquarters somewhere in america long cherished in its files a list of gallant deeds done by brave women the bulk of them telephone girls of special articles for magazines every one of whom was wont this file was open to writers to say please omit lists of brave deeds done by telephone girls they are always risking their lives and there are too many to count it begins to look as if telephone girls are expected to risk their y temporary defeat 27 lives not only withoiit recognition but without recompense al though the women operators recently sent to france with the american expeditionary force are being placed within twenty three miles of the firing line and are subject to all dangers that follow linemen engineers and other types of signal corps work ers yet because they are rated as civilian employees and have no military status they do not come under the provisions of the war risk insurance act and are not entitled to any of its benefits this was an oversight of course one of the many thousand instances of the way men omit to reckon women as people until they see long lines of them swinging into action when they wake up and say by jove we forgot all about the women according to mr samuel mccune lindsay assistant secre tary of the united states treasury the only way that this over sight about the telephone girls can be remedied is by an amend ment to the war risk insurance act such an amendment is now before congress and the war work council of the national board of the young women’s christian association has recently passed a resolution heartily endorsing it this amendment is not limited to caring for one group of women war workers but is drawn up to include persons not in the military or naval forces of the united states rendering services auxiliary to the conduct of the war or about to engage in such services a very direct way for women to prove that they are con cerned in the welfare of these girls who are taking the chances of war without the protection afforded to their brothers is to write and say so to the men in washington who have this matter in hand these men are senator f m simmons chairman of the finance committee of the senate and hon thetus sims chairman of the interstate and foreign commerce

of them denied the accusation and the friends of both were indignant over the baseless stories cir culated on the subject in the press mrs pink ham gave out the following statement i believe in the

of the main charge made against her viz that she had comment opposed the liberty loan she said she be lieved it would be wise for the government to raise more money by taxation and less by bor rowing but as congress had decided in favor of the present method she had advocated the buying of liberty bonds and her husband had bought all the liberty bonds they could afford the charges were fully threshed out in con vention mrs carrie chapman catt who was present said that she had listened attentively to all the accusations brought against both can didates and had heard nothing that would

restful influence of knitting why should not the tired business man try it a s b june 8 1918 if your babies were gassed he situation of the women and children close to the lines at such a place as toul presents a tragic picture the pe0ple of these small villages which have been bombarded and gassed naturally cling to the localities they know and love in one village which had suf fered almost complete annihilation from bom bardment and in which only a dozen adults were living out of a population of four or five hun dred the people had crept back and with the help of the soldiers quartered there had re stored in a crude way their little church the constant danger in which the civil population finds itself makes it dihicult to expect much normality from them to draw them to safer places and to get them interested in work that seems to have some future to it some perma nency is the splendid work of prefet mirman of the district of meurthe et moselle on july 26 1917 a telegram came to the american fund for french wounded from prefet mirman saying that 350 children had suddenly been put into his care and that they had nothing but a temporary shelter in some old barracks at toul and his need for assistance in the care of them was acute mrs isabel lath rop to whom the telegram had been sent brought it at once to major murphy who felt that the red cross must help in such a situation in a few hours eight workers were on their way to toul a doctor nurse two aids a bac teriologist an administrative director and two women to take charge of the bedding clothing and food a camionette loaded with milk and clothing started at the same time the work ers arrived at toul that night they found the 50 children herded together in an old barrack dirty and practically unfurnished and with no sanitary appliances or toilet arrangements the sick children were crowded in with the well ones skin diseases were prevalent and vermin abounded it was a sorry sight those chil dren 21 of them under one year of age and the rest between one and eight years had been gath ered in toul because the germans were using bombs of asphyxiating gas in the villages back of the lines the adults can wear the gas masks but the little children do not use them success fully and therefore must be moved to places of by june richardson lucas of the american red cross children’s bureau goat some lumber was brought to the grounds and other material to build swings and see saws for the children’s recrea tions a trip was taken over the district nancy was visited the area of the gas danger made it utterly impracticable to return children to their homes pompey with its thousands of children living in caves on account of the nightly bomb attacks wanted medical attention for the children in fact the whole district showed the greatest need of a good beginning at toul a real children’s center both medically and in the social welfare work needed in such circumstances a real hospital for children in connection with the dispensary at luxembourg with a stad large enough to permit medical care and supervision over the whole district by send ing the doctors to different towns to hold week ly or bi weekly clinics and bringing back to the hospital at toul the cases needing hospital care was fhe plan which prefet mirman outlined to the red cross dr lucas decided upon the adoption of the plan immediately this hospital is known as the american fund for french wounded hospital for children it operates throughout the entire district of meurthe et moselle and includes dispensaries and visiting services diet kitchens and schools t nancy the refugee girls are taught sew ing and designing of garments each girl makes small models of different outfits such as trousseaux and layettes and these are mounted in folders with the patterns and dimen sions and instructions so as to be taken back to their villages later the old men and_boys are taught carpentry all the furniture made is used at once in the asile or stored away to be taken home to their beloved villages when the war is over in this way the great prefet seeks to give the poor people of his district a new hold'upon life by giving them the feeling that in spite of all the destruction around them in spite of the vanishing of all they had they can still accumulate possessions and not sit empty handed in the wake of fire and shell so the work in the district of muerthe et moselle offers much'hope if the american red cross can keep the health of the 33 the best 0 vote makers woman’s sphere in germany he german metal

part of the war work of the brooklyn borough woman suffrage party whose chairman is mrs e edward dreier it was wonderfully equipped with machines and raw materials by mrs george notman and the workers have already supplied gauze compresses strips as sorted dressings triangular bandages amount ing to thousands of pieces besides babies clothes and hip length bed packets after the unit reached france

able to cover almost every special need by means of some designated check so as not to draw upon the general funds she is only waiting for further instructions from the other side before laying out a

has been sent on its way as soon as possible brooklyn suffragists under mrs notman have recently found that the nurses and aids are in need of aprons and they are now making nurs ing aprons these were furnished originally by the nurses and aids themselves but they have neither time nor opportunity in the rush of work at the front to replace those which are used up _on hearing that dr emmet holt’s

will receive immediate attention the temperance orator’s blunder sat the other day in a church auditorium in a town in which women have no vote even in the municipal elections i was one of one hundred women plus there were seven teen men present by actual count the occasion was a temperance meeting in the dry cam paign and the special topic subject and motto was don’t waste your vote a very timely warning to the privileged voter every woman present i believe felt keenly the tremendous importance of that distinct note of warning but i am certain that she also felt the ridiculousness of the situation for the voters whom the speaker addressed were not present it was almost a gruesome fact hardly believable that a man would allow himself to imagine that unenfranchised women are voters he knows better but he does not know that he knows better and therefore his knowledge fails to advance either temperance or suffrage i believe that this is the average attitude of mind of the usual public speaker on modern problems in this and other states where women are denied the ballot on the other hand let us not forget and we do not the great and good men to whom the cause of suffrage is as their right arm this modern reformer does not ignore us as women for we are usually his inspiration and often the bulk of his audience by harriet lamb hyde to be sure there are large mass meetings of men these days of white heat interest in temo perance but there are other gatherings also open to both men and women and here the latter appear in no sniall numbers i think they come for the reason that they cannot stay away their very life and happiness are in the balance at this time of decision for or against the saloon it is the crisis in the history of thousands of homes ow the style of exhortation on the part of this temperance friend on this occasion was something like this don’t forget to reg ister let nothing keep you from the polls your opinion won’t sway things unless you express it by a clean cut vote it was splendid counsel which if unheeded could proveitself a powerful enemy in our loved temperance cause it could defeat any goliath but it was wasted for the present at least when flung to the vote less women of the town of b what can be said of this make believe attitude of mind of the usual speakers toward unenfranchised women surely it is an inter esting study in psychology custom and tradi tion have ranked women as non voters while fetters of indifference have held men’s minds in their mighty grip until they are unable to think straight or bravely face the facts rather they just make believe that women have the bal lot it is queer is it not and the queerest part of it is this that any man as well as any woman can submit to a condition so ludicrous and contradictory n this wonderful day when the subject of suffrage is not dangerously unpopular in any state or section of the national life a larger frankness and deeper sincerity must come in public speech concerning it that note of free dom is sometimes heard and yet the average platform speaker is lame and halt and blind and obtuse for even incidentally if be but guessed it he could edify and delight his hea‘r ers by his attitude toward woman’s greater liberty in the affairs of state instead of make believe he might well look us friendly women in the face and say these kindly honest things and true things of those better days so sure to come and so soon to come when the cause of suffrage as well as of temperance will be a glorious triumph such words would brighten his speech and they would brighten also the spirit of thousands of women listening and waiting and working these long long years until their hour should strike the number twelve digitized by 600816 june 8 1918 35 your vote for democracy and efficiency n preceding articles on state and local gov ernments the attempt has been made not to advocate reforms but simply to state facts nevertheless the description of the twentieth century city must have made it clear that very practical criticism of governmental forms ex ists that this criticism has had practical re sults in some cities and the new forms of city government which have resulted have on the whole worked better than the old the im provement has been on the one hand in the etiiciency of government on the other in the greater dependence of government officials on the electorate in the beginning of this century there had been no practical experiments in new govern mental forms some twenty years later be tween three and four hundred cities had made successful experimentwnd thereby increased their ediciency and democracy what was true of the cities in 1900 is true of the other local governments county and state in 1918 change and improvement lies in the future the county has been called the dark con tinent of american government los angeles county california alone has replaced the old government of three parts by the commission the traditional form of county government has hardly been touched regardless of what new local units grew up and encroached on the county’s functions in new england its otii cials have continued though township develop ment has made them of little importance owhere is the overlapping of oliicials more noticeable confusing and wasteful than in the great city counties where the voter has had to elect and pay for a full set of county officials whom the city has made either entirely unnecessary or to whom it has left so few functions that their number could have been cut down or their work taken over by city functionaries new york city completely covers five counties new york voters elect besides 93 city officials county officials the case of chicago has al ready been referred to chicago voters elect all told no less than 383 national state county and city officers of whom 251 belong to the overlapping city and county governments there are two serious criticisms of a system like this one is its enormous and useless ex pense a well worked out plan which has been under consideration for consolidating the gov ernments of cook county and chicago will save that city if it is put into effect about three and one quarter million dollars a year the other criticism is that democracy is only a theory when the voter is called upon to accom plish the impossible task of deciding on the fitness of so many oliicials the long bal lot says one authority delivers the voter into the hands of the politicians who patch up a slate for him only a handful of cities have abolished county government san francisco has taken steps toward shortening the county city ballot by making its board of county supervisors and its city government one alameda county california has proposed ax plan which by giving health police and the like h s gilbertson 95 supernumerary by mary sumnerf boyd for the live material in this and the three preceding articles in this series credit is

woman voter functions exclusively to the county and streets public works and the like to the 11 municipali ties within its boundaries would cut the com bined ballot from 24 to 8 ofiicials the cutting out of superfluous county officials and county functions would be one step toward improved county government another would be giving the county a certain degree of home rule in the carrying on of its necessary func tions only in michigan and in a few california counties is the county allowed any scope in making its own ordinances or in framing its own charter without running to a legislature remote from its particular problems in order to carry through the smallest detail of legisla tion we have already noted a like handicap in many cities or the improvement of state government the short ballot with its attendant increased power of appointment by the governor and his direct responsibility to the people is one main need the governor was originally appointed by the legislature but the movement toward democ racy of a later generation changed the method of appointment to election by the people and the last fifty years or so have been charac terized by a great increase in the governor's power nevertheless as we saw in the chapter on the state though chief executive he is not the sole responsible executive in the state every state has a list of six or a dozen other execu tives secretary of state treasurer etc who are responsible only to the electors and these electors are burdened with too many elections to choose wisely what is needed in government says one authority is the definite assumption of re sponsibility by some one who is visible to the eye and can be got at this is as good a definition as any of the short ballot some one otiicial visible to the eye instead of a crowd any member of which from their very multitude can escape detection by the voters in the governors messages to the 1917 legis latures the need for greater power and greater responsibility by the chief executive was ex pressed more than once said the governor of west virginia for example we never shall have eliicient government so long as seven in dependent otiicials carry on the west virginia government with no central control or respon sibility so many other suggestions for improving state government were made in these messages that the new republic expressed itself as con fident that we are about to enter an area of reconstruction and reform comparable to that through which the municipalities have passed since 1900 certain it is that the governor’s messages were expressive of a general move7 ment that has actually begun for in 1917 illinois passed a civil administration code which while leaving the state elective officers nothing but constitutional amendment can re move them and the present illinois constitution is practically unamendable provided a cabinet system of government with the governor di rectly responsible for the appointment of ten department ofiicials and their subordinates this is a step toward centralizing power and respon sibility other changes which should give us governors better fitted to exercise wide respon sibility are a longer term and a higher average of salary he governors messages of 1917 made other suggestions than those touching the governors power the governor of new jersey wanted a state manager and others wanted changes in the legislature the business manager and commission have worked well in the cities but the city's main function is business the state’s as we have seen is legislation and authori ties doubt whether the same system would work as well at any rate we have no experience to speak from kansas has a business manager for all its state institutions but this is after all only a small part of the government so her experience does not teach us much as to changes needed in state legislatures it is strongly felt that the two chamber bica meral legislature and the three part govern ment is often an obstruction but not a safe guard that the checks and balances pro vided by this form of government have been so used that as one writer expresses it the grafters get the checks and the public pays the balances the two chambers serve as a means by which politicians can kill good bills in one house if not in the other and the three part government as a means of shifting respon sibility hatever the final form state legisla tures take what is wanted to start with in our legislatures is less legislators long terms and good pay to raise their stand ard and get more experienced service from them long sessions so that legis lators shall give their full time to the service of the state less laws and better con sidered vhatever executive officers may be left off the ballot all legislators should be on the ballot because legislation is the foundation of government and legislators should be demo cratically chosen and subject to the recall be sides this the people should have legislative power through the initiative and referendum already a beginning has been made in this form of direct government by the people twenty two states had in may 1918 added some form of statewide initiative referendum and recall amendment to their constitutions and twenty two had such laws applying to city ordinances delaware indiana rhode island and vermont were the

united states pay the expense of carrying and distributing advertising matter as said be _fore the zone law increases only nominally the postage on reading matter for instance from new york to el paso about 2,500 miles it merely increases the postage on reading mat ter from 1 cent to 1 cents per pound the increase is on advertising viz from 1 cent to 3 cents per pound from new york to el paso to illustrate the woman citizen under the old law can send 5 copies from new york to el paso for 1 cent now under the zone law if it contained all reading matter it could send 5 copies from new york to el paso for 1 cents or only an increase of postage of 1 20 of a cent per copy and it can have half of its issue advertising matter and still send 3 copies to el paso for only 2 cents or less than cent per copy it is the publishers who make the profits on advertising should they or the people pay the postage for transporting this advertising even under the present zone law our gov ernment will still

under the old then a cer tain class of headmistresses called grade ii have a maximum below that of an assistant master so that a headmistress may be getting less than an assistant master in her own
