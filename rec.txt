in its literature an abundant and incomparable treasure but it is an inheritance that must be reclaimed by each generation the library of christian classics is designed to present in the english language and in twenty six volumes of convenient size a selection of the most indispensable christian treatises written prior to the end of the sixteenth century the practice of giving circulation to writings selected for superior worth or special interest was adopted at the beginning of christian history the canonical scriptures were themselves a selection from a much wider literature in the patristic era there began to appear a class of works of compilation often designed for ready reference in controversy of the opinions of well reputed predecessors and in the middle ages many such works were produced these medieval anthologies actually preserve some noteworthy materials from works otherwise lost in modern times with the increasing inability even of those trained in universities and theological colleges to read latin and greek texts with ease and familiarity the translation of selected portions of earlier christian literature into modern languages has become more necessary than ever while the wide range of distinguished books written in vernaculars such as english makes selection there also needful the efforts that have been made to meet this need are too numerous to be noted here but none of these collections serves the purpose of the reader who desires a library of representative treatises spanning the christian centuries as a whole most of them embrace only the age of the church fathers and some of them have long been out of print a fresh translation of a work already 9 10 general editors preface translated may shed much new light upon its meaning this is

and commerce with a popula tion reckoned at about half a million there was a large jewish population there the learned jew philo elder contemporary of paul says that the jews in alexandria and all egypt totalled a million 1 it was the home of that hellenistic judaism of which philo's works are the outstanding monument nevertheless we have no reliable information concerning the way in which the young christian movement developed there the fourth century historian eusebius of caesarea reports that mark was the first bishop of alexandria a statement which does not take us be yond the realm of legend but it is highly probable that there were christians there in apostolic times in the acts of the apostles i8 24ff luke tells of apollos who was an alex andrian he may well have learnt there such knowledge of jesus as he possessed before he met aquila and priscilla it is only towards the end of the second century that the christian community at alexandria emerges from its shroud of darkness earlier in the second century during the latter part of hadrian's reign there flourished at alexandria a distinguished christian teacher named basilides soon after him there fol lowed the even more eminent valentine who moved to rome where it seems he very nearly succeeded in becoming pope i philo in flaccum 43 cf f the commentary in h box's edition london 1939 p 94 on the history of the jewish colony at alexandria see also h b swete introduction to the old testament in greek 1902 pp i ff h i bell jews and christians in egypt 1924 pp 10 ff and his recent forwood lectures cults and creeds in graeco roman egypt 1953 15 l6 clement of alexandria both these teachers however were prominent in the so called gnostic movement of the period and their opinions were not acceptable to the church at large to these men clement of alexandria owed much both as provoking reaction and as commanding assent of the life of clement himself not much is known he was born about the middle of the second century probably in athens of pagan parents his father may have been a des cendant of a freedman of the titus flavius clemens who shared the consulship with the emperor domitian in a.d 95 like many men of that age he travelled about to receive instruction from various teachers in a famous passage he tells us about his education strom i 1 1 this book is not written to show off my skill as a writer it is rather that i am treasuring up notes for my old age a remedy for forge tfulness 2 they are intended simply as a picture and rough sketch of those clear and living teachings and of those blessed and truly honourable men whom i was privileged to hear of them one was an ionian who taught in greece others were in magna graecia i.e southern italy of them one came from coele syria the other from egypt others lived in the east of these one was an assyrian one a palestinian hebrew after i met the last who was first of them in importance i abandoned further search having discovered him hiding in egypt a truly sicilian bee he drew honey from the flowers in the meadow 3 of the apostles and prophets and implanted in the souls of his pupils pure knowledge the identity of clement's last teacher is not in doubt he was pantaenus described here as a truly sicilian bee the best honey came from sicily 4 so that this is clement's way of com plimenting him upon the brilliance of his lectures the phrase gives us no compelling reason for supposing as has been thought by many writers on clement that pantaenus was a sicilian pantaenus was head of the christian school at alexandria and before his conversion was said to have been a stoic eusebius h.e v 10 we are also told that he had visited india little is known of his teaching and it has proved a forlorn undertaking to attempt any reconstruction of his ideas from clement's works clement met pantaenus perhaps about a.d 180 not long 2 a commonplace cf cicero pro sulla 45 3 a reminiscence of euripides hippolytus 76 ff cf w

afterwards he succeeded pantaenus at the christian school and proceeded to give lectures and to write works intended to win over to the church the educated classes of alexandria clement's chief extant writings are his great trilogy a the exhortation to the greeks protrepticus in one book b the instructor paedagogus in three books c the miscellanies stromateis the title stromateis was not uncommonly used in clement's age for writings without any strict order and contain ing varied subject matter 5 in the manuscripts there are eight books of the stromateis and eusebius of caesarea thought the whole work was complete in the eight books before him 6 but the eighth book was evidently not intended for publication and consists of notes of a preparatory nature on which clement draws in the first seven books probably it was appended to the incomplete work after clement's death how many books cle ment meant to write we cannot tell at the end of book vii cf also vii 89 he writes of continuing further the only other complete work from clement's pen is the tractate on the rich young ruler quis dives salvetur 1 written to reassure his wealthy and cultured christian pupils that christ condemned only the wrong attitude to wealth not wealth as such numerous fragments of other works are quoted in later writers and the manuscripts also preserve two works which throw important light on gnosticism entitled selections from the prophetic sayings eclogae propheticae and epitomes from the writings of theodotus and the so called eastern teaching of the time of valentinus excerpta ex theodoto of the latter there is an edition with english translation and notes by dr r p casey 1934 it is scarcely intelligible without an extensive commentary ii clement's life work was a war waged on

christianity to notions drawn from graeco oriental syncretism and heterodox judaism these sects had given ordinary church folk such a fright that they had come to fight shy of any form of christianity which claimed philosophical support that philosophy was the mother of all heresy was the firm conviction of tertullian of carthage clement's contemporary he remarks that the heretics quote seek and ye shall find to defend their curiosity but for ter tullian christian believers have already found the object of their search after one has believed there is but one thing more to be believed namely that there is nothing more to believe de praescr 9 the pagan critic of christianity celsus writing about a.d 177 180 probably at alexandria or perhaps at rome says that while indeed there are some educated chris tians the majority commonly say do not ask questions only believe faith will save you wisdom is an evil thing and foolish ness good 9 galen the distinguished medical writer of this time caustically remarks if i had in mind people who taught their pupils in the same way as the followers of moses and christ teach theirs for they order them to accept everything on faith i should not have given you a definition 10 distrust of learn ing and argument was evidently characteristic of much christian feeling at this period the most tertullian was prepared to give in justification of his belief was credo quia absurdum and the roman hippolytus clement's junior contemporary constructed his refutation of all heresies on the assumption that each heretic derived his ideas from some pagan philosopher an assumption for which classical scholars have every reason to be grateful to him since he thus preserves valuable fragments of early philo sophers like heraclitus accordingly in the eyes of many christians it was doing the devil's work to pretend that anything more than simple faith was required such an attitude did nothing to commend chris tianity to educated people clement conceives of his task as a vocation to see to it that the church is made safe for a more positive evaluation of greek philosophy for him it is a pastoral necessity arising directly out of his work among the cultured classes of alexandria to tell a well educated catechumen that even the greatest of greek poets and philosophers were in spired by the devil would be catastrophic the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof quotes clement in self justifica 9 origen contra celswn i 5 9 10 see r walzer galen on jews and christians 1949 pp 15 48 56 general introduction iq tion and anyone who seeks to help catechumens especially if they are greeks must not shrink from scholarly study 11 but the multitude are scared of greek philosophy as children are of masks fearing that it will lead them astray 12 like the com panions of odysseus passing the sirens they stop up their ears because they know that if they once allow themselves to listen to greek learning they will not be able afterwards to find their way home again 13 i am well aware of what is said by some who stupidly take fright at any noise they assert that one must con cern oneself only with what is necessary and is bound up with faith that we ought to pass by anything outside this as super fluous because it distracts us to no purpose and absorbs our energies in studies which are of no help towards our ultimate end there are others who even think that philosophy was introduced into human life by some evil inventor for the ruin of men 14 the existence of such critics makes clement cautious in his expressions it has even been suggested that only this obscurity of his style prevented clement from suffering condemnation like origen in later centuries 15 the miscellanies is a baffling and enigmatic work to read because clement is constantly passing from one subject to another leaving hints and allusions unex plained and undeveloped he himself makes it clear that this is a deliberate attempt to cover his tracks 16 he wishes to be con ciliatory to his opponents and never lashes them with scorn at most he allows himself a gentle irony 17 to his critics he admits that pagan philosophy is a harlot but the scripture says be not much with a strange woman prov 5 20 this is an admonition that we are to use but not to linger and spend too much time with worldly culture 18 clement believes that philosophy is of divine origin in an important passage he discusses various possible explanations of the origin of philosophy 19 they may say that it is mere chance that the greeks have expressed something of the true

their argument with us or they may call it a happy coincidence or in the next place it may be said that the greeks possessed an idea of the truth implanted by nature but we know that the creator of nature is one only and if it is said that they had a common mind let us examine who is author of it and of the righteousness which is apparent in the distribution of mind to all men 20 but if anyone says that the cause of this anticipation in greek philosophy is a previous proclamation or says that it is due to a coincidental agreement he is implying that it is a form of prophecy moreover others affirm that many teachings of the philosophers arise from a reflection of the truth i.e by introspection the philosopher contemplates the image of god within himself which is a reflection of god cf i cor 13 12 it is with the last view that clement associates himself but it is characteristic of him not to be too decided on the point and elsewhere he alludes favourably to the view that greek philo sophy goes back to the fallen angels of genesis ch 6 who were supposed to have imparted their secrets to their women folk so that the truth albeit in distorted form had come down to men strom v 10 cf i 81 he is particularly attracted by the theory taken over from traditional jewish apologetic that the greek philosophers had plagiarized moses the lord had said all who came before me were thieves and robbers clement devotes inordinate space to proving the priority of moses and to arguing that the greeks had stolen their ideas from the old testament and in a long section strom v 89 139 he even argues that this is only to be expected since the greeks were in the habit of plagiarizing from one another it is necessary to ob serve that much of this section like other parts of the miscel lanies seems itself to have been a compilation drawing on earlier sources 21 clement's debt to other writers is so great that some modern scholars have treated him as if he had not a single idea of his own and was merely a compiler of other men's work if clement were no more than an expert with scissors and paste he would scarcely merit jerome's high praise that of all the fathers he was the most learned efrist lxx 4 it is of course demonstrable that he draws much from elsewhere for his too numerous poetic 20 allusion to plato laws 714 a 21 for a recent discussion see k ziegler's article plagiat in pauly wissowa rsalenc xx 2 1950 cols 1984 1991 general introduction 21 quotations he uses anthologies and for his philosophy he uses the current handbooks of potted philosophy summarizing the opinions of the various schools 22 the same practice was adopted by many others of his time both pagan and christian there can however be no question that he had an excellent first hand knowledge of most of the classics of greek literature he knew well homer and euripides plato and the stoics platonic allusions are particularly frequent 3 and probably even now not all of them have been noticed and identified equally familiar to him were the writings of philo of alexandria from whom he quotes almost as often as from plato philo provided him with a ready rnade attitude to greek philosophy he had interpreted the story of hagar and sarah as an allegory of the relations of philosophy and theology to show that the former is to be the handmaid of the latter 23 it is an attitude clement is glad to make his own paul had spoken of the law of moses as a paidagogos until the coming of christ gal 3 24 clement would attribute the same role to greek philosophy even if greek philosophy does not comprehend the truth in its entirety and in addition lacks the strength to fulfil the lord's command yet at least it prepares the way for the teaching which is royal in the highest sense of the word by making a man self controlled by moulding his character and by making him ready to receive the truth strom i 80 greek philosophy as it were provides for the soul the preliminary cleansing and training required for the reception of the faith on which foundation the truth builds up the edifice of knowledge strom vii 20 ill if on the one hand clement is anxious to vindicate for christian teachers the right to study the greek philosophers and poets on the other hand he wishes to make it clear that this does not leave the door open for unorthodox gnostic speculations between clement and the gnostics there were two chief points 22 h diels doxographi graeci pp 244 ff 23 philo de congressu eruditionis gratia freely pillaged by clement strom i 28 32 the jewish wisdom literature was also of great importance to clement in enabling him to bridge the gulf between the biblical theology of church tradition and the rational inquiry of philosophy cf w volker die verwertung der weisheit literatur bei den christlichen alex andrinern in jjeits.f kirchengeschichte lxiv 1953 pp 1 33 22 clement of alexandria at issue their pessimistic view of the world and their denial of the part played by free will in the attainment of salvation the gnostics took so pessimistic a view of the created world that they refused to recognize in its creator the god and father of our lord jesus christ this present evil world must be the work of an inferior perhaps even of an evil power it certainly could not have been made by the supreme god of whom it was entirely unworthy it followed from this that the old testament which was inspired by the creator must be similarly inferior and could tell us little or nothing about the god revealed in jesus christ in the third book of his miscellanies clement has a full scale discussion of the implications of this view of the world the gnostic estimate of the world led to two opposed attitudes to sex and marriage clement himself divides his opponents into two groups the extreme ascetics and the licentious strom ill 40 of the former class the most prominent representatives are mar cion and tatian although in other respects marcion stood apart from the gnostic movement he shared their idea of the old testament and the creation the inferior creator god had given the command increase and multiply and replenish the earth 5 gen 1 28 the good marcionite would therefore do nothing whatever to assist the creator in his business in fact in marcion's eyes the methods chosen by the creator for replenish ing the world were as nasty as could be marcion's language about sex and the process of reproduction shows him to have been a psychopathic case the contemplation of sex over whelmed him with a sense of nausea no member of the mar cionite church was allowed to be married a similarly ascetic line was adopted by tatian former pupil of the apologist justin martyr there is all too little evidence of the details of the heretical doctrines he came to hold irenaeus has three complaints to make against him a he adopted valentinian ideas about invisible aeons b he called marriage fornication like marcion and saturninus c he denied that adam could be saved 24 he evidently came to attribute an inferior status to the creator and the created world since he interpreted let there be light gen 1 3 as a request from the creator who found himself in darkness and had to ask the supreme god for light so that he could see to make the world 25 in strom ill 80 8 1 clement quotes from tatian's work en 24 irenaeus adv haer i 28 quoted by eusebius h.e iv 29 1 25 see prof oulton's note on origen de orat xxiv 5 p 358 below general introduction 23 titled on perfection according to the saviour it was prob ably the ascetic tendency of this work which led to tatian's separation from the church his excommunication is dated by eusebius in ajx lys 26 when the church at rome became too hot to hold him he returned to his native land mesopotamia where he exercised wide influence and would it seems have found many like minded persons who held the married state to be incompatible with the christian profession 27 his harmony of the gospels diatessaron remained in general use especially in the syrian church for which it was originally composed a greek version was soon made for the many greek speaking christians of the eastern provinces 28 whether the oration to the greeks for which he is chiefly known was written at rome or in mesopotamia is not certain if as has recently been urged 29 it was written late in 177 or early in 178 then it is clear that even after his separation from the church tatian remained faithful to the apologetic tradition he had inherited from justin it is interesting that clement's quotations from tatian's work on perfection according to the saviour show that he expounded paul and give no hint that he rejected the apostle's writings his followers however according to the statements of hippolytus and origen rejected the pauline epistles and eusebius says that they also rejected the acts 30 of the ascetic wing of the gnostic movement clement's third representative is julius cassianus we know nothing about him other than what we are told by clement jerome's state ments about him are wholly dependent on clement we learn that he was the originator of docetism a statement which cannot be accepted in view of the new testament evidence for the prevalence of this tendency before the end of the first century i john 4 1 ff in the first book of the miscellanies cassian is mentioned with respect in company

strom ill 92 at the opposite extreme to the ascetic sects were the carpo cratians this sect is a peculiar phenomenon even in the curious penumbra of eccentric sects which gathered round the church in the second century and claimed the name of christian the evidence concerning the sect is not a little obscure the origin of the sect is ascribed by clement and irenaeus to a man carpo crates but his historical existence has been doubted we have to examine the possibility that clement and irenaeus assumed that the sect was founded by a man of this name just as ter tullian invents a mythical ebion as founder of the ebionites the earliest writer to speak of the sect is celsus the pagan critic of christianity whose true doctrine was probably written about a.d 177 180 he enumerates several christian sects ob serving that none is willing to co operate with any other there are he says marcellians who follow marcellina and harpo cratians who follow salome and others who follow mariamme and others who follow martha the immorality of some of these groups is even more shameful he thinks than that associated with the hero cult paid to hadrian's favourite antinous for his factual information about these sects celsus seems to have been dependent not upon a first hand acquaintance but upon some orthodox christian pamphlet elsewhere his remarks about marcion strongly suggest that such anti heretical literature lay before him eft origen contra celsum vi 53 with my note thereon he goes on to observe that some of these heretics are called presumably by their orthodox critics circes and wily agitators and others sirens who seal the ears of their converts and make their heads like pigs 31 contemporary with celsus is the bare mention of the carpo cratians in the memoirs of hegesippus

of irenaeus reproduced in essen tials by most of the later anti heretical writers 33 carpocrates believed that the world was created by inferior angels jesus son of joseph however exercising his platonic powers of anam nesis remembered what he had seen in the divine sphere and on this account power came upon him from the father to enable him to escape from the world creators souls like jesus can similarly overcome the world being visited by the same power which they can obtain by magic those who possess it can in dulge in any practice without danger since right and wrong are merely human conventions it is by faith and love that we are saved if it is to avoid reincarnation the soul must have experi ence of everything this being the meaning of jesus words thou shalt not go forth thence till thou hast paid the last farthing irenaeus concludes his account of the carpocratians by observing that one group of them was led by a lady named mar cellina who came to rome in the time of pope anicetus c a.d 155 166 this group had a ceremony of initiation which was a literal baptism by fire initiates were branded with a hot iron at the back of the lobe of the right ear irenaeus information thus fills out and substantiates the obscure references in celsus the carpocratian ceremony of baptism by branding the ear is also mentioned by the valentinian heracleon 34 hitherto the evidence considered is reasonably coherent and self consistent but some modern writers doubt whether clement's information in the third book of the miscellanies is equally reliable clement gives here substantial quotations from a book attributed to carpocrates son epiphanes entitled con cerning righteousness this work merely consists of the scribblings of an intelligent but nasty minded adolescent of somewhat pornographic tendencies the work attempts to justify extreme sexual licence by a communistic theory the existence of private property is of human invention and has no divine sanction

mother named alexandria came from the town of same in the island of cephallenia in the ionian islands after their son died at the tender age of seventeen they founded a temple in his honour at same and the islanders used to gather once a month for a religious beano in celebration of the hero's birthday volkmar entirely disbelieved in the existence of such a person as epiphanes he held that

saw that there must have been an alexandrian gnostic named epiphanes who was author of the book concerning righteousness but this person has no connection with the moon god worshipped on cephallenia celsus calls the sect cc harpocratians from this the conclu sion has been drawn that the name of the sect was not taken from any man carpocrates but from the egyptian deity horus son of isis and osiris who was worshipped by the greeks under the name carpocrates or harpocrates both forms of the name occur in inscriptions egyptian deities were worshipped in asia minor and the greek islands 37 harpocrates may well have been worshipped at cephallenia although no inscriptions have been found there to prove it 38 he may there have been associated with a feminine consort named after the city

introduction 27 against this view we have to reckon the explicit and detailed statements which clement makes even to the inclusion of the precise age at which epiphanes died clement's story is circum stantial and as a general rule it is safe to say that clement is the most reliable of all early christian writers on gnosticism on basilides and valentine he is extremely well informed it would be remarkable if he were to be completely mistaken in this instance in a recent attempt to discredit clement's evidence heinz kraft has emphasized the silence of clement regarding marcellina and the ceremony of branding the ear with hot iron but this proves nothing in any event clement is in entire accord with both celsus and irenaeus in representing the sect as wholeheartedly licentious clement's only statement about the metaphysics of the carpo cratians is that they believed in the monadic gnosis this is not supported by irenaeus or hippolytus but it is curiously echoed by two latin christian writers who have been suspected of using a lost work of hippolytus 40 and it is entirely in clement's manner to concentrate attention upon the ethics rather than the metaphysics of the heretical sects basilides is treated in exactly this way the cryptic statement that the doc trine of the monad was important for the carpocratians is perhaps explained by the quotation clement makes strom iii 29 from a lost apocryphal work and which he regards as the mother of their licentiousness it is an account of the origin of the world the monad was alone at first but since it seemed good to its unity not to be alone an idea came forth from it and from the intercourse of monad and idea came the invisible powers of the cosmos clement observes that the valentinian doctrine is superficially akin to this but that in valentine's system the union of the pairs in the pleroma is wholly spiritual whereas the licentious sects have understood the union in crudely physical terms clement's statement that epiphanes 3 birthday was celebrated gnosis 3rd edn 1941 pp 257 ft the case has been argued with at least the maximum of plausibility by h kraft gab es einen gnostiker karpo krates in

have been another man named carpocrates but we really have no certain knowledge about the sect whatever the reliability of clement's statements is upheld by hilgenfeld ketzergeschichte p 403 h liboron

there is plenty of evidence that in antiquity birth days were celebrated monthly 41 the story of the posthumous cult of epiphanes at same is certainly remarkable clement evidently thought so or he would not have reported the details the cult does not appear to be more remarkable than the hero cult paid to hadrian's favourite the boy antinous who was drowned in the nile in a.d 130 the emperor believed the boy had become a star 42 the celebrations at antinoopolis in egypt were attended by nocturnal orgies so notorious that they were generally deplored by such writers as celsus and were a godsend to critics of pagan ism like the christian apologists indeed when celsus com pares the licentiousness of the carpocratians with that of the revellers of the cult of antinous he may have been nearer the truth than he knew it is not impossible that the carpocratians modelled their practice on the recently founded cult of hadrian's favourite the activities of carpocrates are no doubt rightly dated by theodoret in the time of hadrian and it would not be a unique case of cultus offered to a young child early ripened for heaven a famous inscription found on the island of thera records that a mouseion was built by a husband and wife whose impulse to found the place came from the early death of their young son an annual sacrifice was offered and a meal eaten there in memory of dead members of the family 43 clement does not say that the carpocratian sect flourished in cephallenia but that epiphanes parents founded a temple there in his memory and venerated him as a hero is not inconceivable nor is it incredible that a seventeen year old boy of some ability even if of little moral education should have written the work concerning righteousness clement makes the carpocratians

general introduction 2g upon the christians the popular scandal that they indulged in immorality this charge is often rebutted by the apologists of the second century though celsus is sufficiently well informed to know that there is no truth in the story origen who thought the story was put into circulation by the jews tells us that in his time these allegations are now condemned even by the multitude and by people entirely alien to our religion as being a false slander against the christians but in the second century the scandal was widely believed this malicious rumour origen observes some time ago exercised an unreasonable influence on a very large number and persuaded people know ing nothing of the gospel that this really was the character of christians and even now it still deceives some who by such stories are repelled from approaching christians even if only for a simple conversation 44 when the rumour began it is not possible to say but it is certainly earlier than the carpocratians the language of tacitus and of the younger pliny about the vices with which the name christian is associated 45 suggests that it was current by the end of the first century three other groups of licentious gnostics are mentioned by clement of those whom he calls antitactae nothing is known from elsewhere the nicolaitans cf rev 2 6 claimed to follow nicolas the proselyte of antioch clement disputes this claim some scholars have thought him correct and have explained the name nicolaitans as due to the common anxiety of here tics to father their opinions on some new testament personage on the other hand it is obvious that clement's remarks about nicolas are whitewash clement was anxious to clear a promi nent person of the apostolic age from any responsibility for those who claimed his authority just as he also argues that the cephas with whom paul had a battle royal at antioch gal 2 11 f was not simon peter the apostle but another disciple of the same name who was one of the seventy sent out by jesus 46 as late as the fifth century john cassian attacks people who deny that the nicolas of acts ch 6 is to be identified with the leader of the nicolaitan sect

30 clement of alexandria prodicus strom iii 30 is a shadowy figure of uncertain date and most of what we know about him is derived from clement besides his immoral teaching he denied the utility of prayer on the ground that since god already knows all our needs there is not the slightest reason to inform him of them strom vii 41 5 an opinion dealt with by origen de orat v i clement also says that his followers prided themselves on pos sessing some writings of zoroaster strom i 69 we know from porphyry's life of plotinus c xvi that apocalypses of zoroaster were current among the gnostics 48 the followers of prodicus knew themselves to be saved and that nothing could interfere with the predeterminate counsel of god they there fore held that apostasy in persecution was a matter of no moral significance for the elect 49 this is about the sum of our know ledge about the sect apart from this there is only the dubious statement of theodore t that prodicus was leader of the adamite sect a group of nudist encratites of whom epiphanius gives an account based on hearsay in his medicine chest for the cure of all heresies so between the two extremes the rigidly ascetic and the freely licentious there stand the two most prominent christian gnos tics basilides and valentine basilides and his son isidore held marriage to be no sin and allowed it on the apostolic ground that it was indeed better to marry than to burn but it was to be avoided by the man who was ambitious to attain perfection the followers of basilides in the next generation after his death departed from their master's teaching and fell into licentious ways strom ill 3 when irenaeus accuses basilides of immorality the charge is evidently not true of the master himself though we have clement's testi mony that it was true of the basilidians of his own time irenaeus however is not well informed about the teaching of the historical basihdes the valentinians were distinguished from other gnostics by their warm approval of monogamous marriage for valentine there was no question of any licentiousness nor of any frowning disapproval much less outright rejection of the married state according to tertullian

feature is the more remark able in that of all the gnostic teachers valentine was the most deeply influenced by platonism which might have encouraged in him a pessimistic view of the world his approval of marriage was grounded upon his fantastic metaphysics to which the hellenistic commonplace idea that things on earth have their counterpart of things in heaven is integral the godhead the pleroma or fullness consists of thirty spiritual beings called aeons the pleroma begins with depth bythos and his consort silence sige 9 whose marriage produces mind and truth these in turn beget word and life to whom are born man and church these eight form the ogdoad in the same kind of way the rest of the pleroma gradually evolves until the full number of thirty aeons is attained we need not stop here on the further develop ment of the system the sacred marriages of the aeons in the godhead cf strom ill 29 are for valentine the model for earthly activity the marriage of the valentinian bridegroom with his valentinian bride is the earthly counterpart of the whole process of evolution enacted in the very life of god who is the pleroma it is a foretaste therefore of that final bliss in the heavenly marriage feast to which all the saved i.e the valen tinians are invited when they are to strip themselves of their souls their wedding garments and pass into the bridal chamber the pleroma itself where they enjoy unutterable union and the beatific vision 52 with the teaching of basilides and more especially of valen tine clement found himself in a fair degree of sympathy both are men of eminence whom he always regards with respect even though he is aware of important differences his main complaint is against the general gnostic tendency to adopt ex treme predestinarian views most of the sects held that they alone were the saved they alone had the divine spark within the naassene sect is quoted by hippolytus as saying we alone of all men are christians ref v 9 22 53 basilides 51 according to irenaeus i 6 4 the valentinians taught that marriage w indeed a mark of the elect pneumatic but continence has to be prac tised by the psychic if he wished to be saved 52 clement exc theod lxiii iv heracleon in origen comm in evang loannis x 19 xiii 52 irenaeus i 7 1 5 3 the pagan celsus says of the christian sects they slander one another with dreadful and unspeakable words of abuse and they will not make even the least concession to reach agreement for they utterly detest each other origen contra celsum v 63 cf ill 10 12 32 clement of alexandria stood far nearer to orthodox christianity than the naassenes whose connections with the faith were to say the least thin he seems to have held a rigorous division of mankind into the saved and the lost in accordance with a supra cosmic election strom ii 10 v 3 iv 165 but we are not told that he identified his own adherents with the saved exclusively valen tine was more explicit he divided mankind into three classes following paul's tripartite division of man into body soul and spirit i thess 5 23 humanity consisted of those whose essen tial nature was spirit the pneumatics those whose nature was of soul stuff the psychics and those who were merely of the earth earthy the pneumatics with whom the valentinians naturally identified themselves were wholly predetermined to gain complete salvation and incorporation into the pleroma the earthy class were equally absolutely predestined for hell the middle class however the psychics consisted of the ordinary members of the christian church who did not attend valen tine's conventicle the valentinian was permitted to hope for their salvation they might be saved or they might be lost everything depended on their use of free will this threefold division valentine takes right through his en tire system he found the middle or psychic category particu larly useful for his christology jesus body he held was not purely spiritual as the cruder docetists had taught nor on the other hand was it of earthy matter as simple church teachers believed it was made of soul stuff it was psychic clement regards this idea with some anxiety as being at least in principle docetic for in strom ill 102 he remarks that because they regard birth into a material body as an evil thing cassian and marcion hold their docetic opinions and even valentine indeed teaches that christ's body was psychic nevertheless clement is able to quote with approval valentine's letter to one agathopus saying that jesus ate and drank in a manner peculiar to himself and the food did not pass out of his body there was no normal digestive process strom ill 59 54 else where clement advances a similar view on his own when he remarks that jesus certainly ate and drank not because he needed to do so for his body was sustained by divine power but 54 origen attacks valentinus christology in his commentary on galatians quoted in pamphjlus apology for origen lommatzsch xxiv 365 ff si vero quis indignas obscocnasque ad haec proferat inquisitiones requirens si etiam digestiones in corpore fiebant nihil absurdum videtur fatcri secundum consequentiam naturae corporeae general introduction 33 because he wished to forestall the docetists strom vi 71 valentine's concession to the docetic spirit in admitting that the body of jesus was not of common matter but was psychic led to trouble in the valentinian school if psychic why could it not be pneumatic according to hippolytus ref vi 35 5 7 this problem led to a split in the valentinian ranks the italian school led by ptolemy and heracleon held that the body was psychic the eastern school led by axionicus of antioch and bardesanes of edessa that it was pneumatic iv clement's personal attitude to marriage is curiously con fused against the heretics he has to give a positive evaluation of marriage as the creation of a beneficent creator and in this spirit he can say that the unmarried man is inferior to the mar ried man because he tends to be more selfish and has fewer opportunities of self denial the married man on the other hand can show his mettle by rising superior to every temptation that assails him through his children and his wife his servants and possessions 5 strom vii 70 again he remarks that the mar ried and unmarried states are alike gifts of god iii 79 echo ing stoic teaching he insists that marriage is to be undertaken for patriotic reasons and for the maintenance of the human race ii 140 the first century stoic musonius rufus asks is it fitting for each man to act for himself alone or to act in the interest of his neighbour also not only that there may be homes in the city but also that the city may not be deserted and that the common good may best be served if you say that each one should look out for his own interests alone you represent man as no different from a wolf it is each man's duty to take thought for his own city and to make of his home a ram part for its protection but the first step toward making his home such a rampart is marriage thus whoever destroys human marriage destroys the home the city and the whole human race for it would not last if there were no procreation of children and there would be no just and lawful procreation of children without marriage 5 55 clement resists the gnostic world denying understanding of the new testament insisting that the apostles themselves were married even paul he thinks 35 musonius frag 14 hensc i cite the translation of cora e lutz in tale classical studies 10 1947 9 pp 92 93 the patriotic niotive for mar riage is attacked by tertullian exh cast 12 a.c 3 34 clement of alexandria was married and the only reason why he did not take her about with him was that it would have been an inconvenience for his ministry strom ill 53 5 5 on the other hand he often expresses himself in terms which are scarcely consistent with so positive an attitude indeed al though the apostles as paul tells us i cor 9 took their wives about with them that the gospel might be preached in the women's quarters without scandal 57 they lived with their con sorts as brother and sister when the heretics who reject mar riage affirm that they are living now the life of the world to come where there is no marriage strom ill 48 58 clement replies that to be consistent they ought equally to abstain from food and drink yet when he himself speaks of the spiritual per fection of the true gnostic he can say that his passionless life in that he lives with his wife as with a sister is a realization on earth of the resurrection state vi 100 in short the best christians in clement's view are those who are married but have no sexual relations with their wives 59 the degree to which he shared his opponents 3 presuppositions is shown by his dis tinction between the pagan ideal of self control and the chris tian ideal the difference is that while the pagan ascetic feels desire and does not give in to it the christian is not to feel any thing at all strom ill 57 58 thus clement's position is vacillating despite his anxiety to vindicate marriage as created by god at heart he shared the idea that sex relations are to be avoided the notion that defile ment attaches to sexual relations is ancient enough and is prominent in much ancient religion the christians took it over so that origen for example directs that prayer should not be made in bed since the marriage union takes place there de orat xxxi 4 like ignatius of antioch origen also enjoins continence before receiving the eucharistic bread 60 and he de clares expressly that he cannot think of the presence of the holy spirit at the time of sexual union lawful marriages are not s s no doubt she would not have fitted comfortably into the basket when her husband escaped from damascus over the city wall 57 similarly didascalia apost 16 ed r h connolly p 148 58 that the celibate lives an angelic life on earth is

it were a prophet doing the act of generation moreover there are many other things for which only human power is required and for which neither does the act itself need nor is it proper for it to have the presence of the holy spirit 61 even clement implies as much when he ob serves that after intercourse christians need no ceremonial washing such as that prescribed in leviticus since they are cleansed once for all by their baptism for every such occasion strom ill 82 the most obvious outcome of this tendency is the demand for clerical celibacy which becomes prominent in the fourth cen tury since the clergy offer the church's sacrifice they must always be free from defilement therefore they must abstain from all sexual intercourse the argument is explicit in ambrose of milan de officiis i 50 258 and the contemporary pope siricius bishop of rome 384 399 did all in his power to en force the celibate ideal on the same ground chastity is required of bishops presbyters and deacons who take part in the divine sacrifices by whose hands both the grace of baptism is given and the body of christ made 62 paul according to siricius teaches in i cor 7 5 that the laity must be continent if their prayers are to be heard how much more ought a priest to be ready at any moment without anxiety whether he is pure and clean in case he should either offer the sacrifice of the eucharist or be compelled to give baptism if he should be con taminated by carnal desire what is he to do is he to excuse himself 63 the movement furthered with enthusiasm by am brose and siricius was in full accord with the ascetic ideals of the age although the laity continued to express their preference for married clergy it was explained that they did not know what was good for them 64 the third and seventh books of clement's miscellanies are documents of the first importance for understanding the origins of christian asceticism the tremendous strength of the gnostic position against which clement contends lay in its not unjusti fied appeal to the world denying strain in new testament 61 origan horn in num vi 3 siricius ep 10 ad gallos episcopos of a.d 391 pjl xiii 11846 cf jerome c lovin i 34

1160 64 jerome c lovin i 34 36 clement of alexandria thought if redemption is made the focal point of theology at the expense of the doctrine of creation this present world can hardly seem other than something from which we must pray to be delivered at an early opportunity so long as the gospel re mained on palestinian soil it was controlled by the tradition of judaism which was very different from that of the graeco oriental world dr k e kirk has written judaism was too deeply committed to the doctrine of the goodness of all god's creation and the divine authority for peopling the world and reaping the fruits of the earth to admit any large element of asceticism or self mortification into its constitution even when it thought of the coming day of the lord 65 but when with paul a hellenistic jew of the dispersion the gospel is launched on the hellenistic world this world denying strain in the new testament meets so to speak with a resonant sounding board upon which the gospel of redemption from sin becomes vastly magnified and filled out to be redemption from this material world the body and all the ills that flesh is heir to the christian apologists of the second century were well aware that they were addressing a world in which renunciation of marriage was highly regarded they could point with no little pride to christian men and women devoted to lifelong chastity 66 the fact that christian virgins had such a consider able sales value is in itself highly significant we have the testimony of the medical writer galen concerning the impres sion which such remarkable chastity made on his mind he writes of the christians as follows their contempt of death is patent to us every day and likewise their restraint in cohabita tion for they include not only men but also women who refrain from cohabiting all through their lives and they also number individuals who in self discipline and self control in matters of food and drink and in their keen pursuit of justice have attained a pitch not inferior to that of genuine philosophers 67 the inconveniences and encumbrances of married life are a matter of frequent comment in ancient writers from a dislike of its inconveniences the greeks have made many adverse observations about the birth of children remarks clement 65 the vision of god p 61 justin apol i 15 6 tatian xxxii 2 athenagoras leg xxxiii i minucius

56 ff general introduction 37 strom ill 22 the works of theophrastus and seneca on marriage and above all the writings of the third century neoplatonist porphyry who collected together an enormous amount of material from earlier writers on this theme illustrate clement's observation the christian writers on asceticism in the fourth century drew heavily on porphyry undeterred by the fact that he was the most prominent and dangerous critic of christianity of his time jerome plunders his work on abstinence to refute the claim of jovinian that virginity was in no degree superior to marriage he does not dare to make any acknowledg ment of his borrowings from such a source 68 porphyry also exercised some influence upon the ascetic ideals of basil the great 69 we find frequent occurrence of the argument that if even good pagans practise the ascetic life the chastity of chris tians must at least exceed theirs 70 towards second marriage clement shares the widespread early christian feeling that it is best avoided but with paul he allows it oh the ground that it is better to marry than to burn if a man makes use of the concession allowed by the apostle he does not commit any sin according to the old testament for it was not forbidden by the law but he does not fulfil the heightened perfection of the gospel ethic strom ill 4 and 82 that second marriage is only tolerable as the lesser of two evils is a very general notion in christian writers of this period including the shepherd of hermas mand iv 4 justin martyr apol i 15 5 and athenagoras who describes it as fair seeming adultery leg 33 2 the montanists altogether excommunicated those who contracted second marriages whether clerical or lay see tertullian de monogama but the church at large took paul to tolerate though not to approve the practice in the case of laymen 71 a passage from one of origen's sermons on st luke may illustrate christian feeling in this matter just as not only fornication but marriage is a disqualification for ecclesiastical 68 e bickel diatribe in senecae philosophi fragmenta i leipzig 1915 pp 129 220 p courcelle les lettres grecques en occident de macrobe d cassia dare paris 1948 pp

of the unspotted members of the church that has no spot or blemish not that he will be sent into eternal fire but he will have no part in the kingdom of god i remember that when i was expounding the word written to the corinthians the church of god which is at corinth with all who call upon him 5 i said that there is a dif ference between the church and those who call upon the name of the lord for i think that the once married and the virgin and he who perseveres in continence are of the church of god he who is twice married may live a good life and have other virtues but he is not of the church of that number who have neither spot nor blemish nor any such thing he is rather of the second grade of those who call on the name of the lord and are saved in the name of jesus christ but are certainly not crowned by him it would be difficult to exaggerate the influence of clement and origen upon later christian ideas of the ascetic life the alexandrian spiritual ideals were taken to the western church by john cassian and so passed to benedict 73 in the east the line of direct influence proceeds through origen's enthusiastic ad mirer and defender eusebius of caesarea 74 to the group of conservative theologians led by basil of ancyra and eustathius of sebaste whose watchword that the son was of like essence with the father was to play a vital part at a crucial stage of the arian controversy a.d 356 361 the tradition was inherited by basil the great whose organization of monasticism was to prove decisive for the eastern church the seventh book of the stromateis shows clement setting forth his ascetic theology at its most impressive the christian life is conceived of as a ladder of ascent the soul progresses from faith to knowledge by suppression of the unreasoning passions and by works of love it mounts to union with god and the beatific vision dominant in clement's thought is the idea of sanctification the true gnostic advances by a continuous moral progress until leaving behind all hindrances and scorn 72 origen horn in lucam xvii 73 w o chadwick john cassian cambridge 1950 the spiritual ideals of clement and origen have been studied in two fine books by

attractions for those who wanted to know the details of the heavenly hierarchy and to learn by heart the pass words and correct amulets which would enable them at death to ascend through the planetary spheres to the supreme god clement's language is frequently reminiscent of gnosticism of a less orthodox stamp his anxiety is to go one better than the sects accordingly he describes the perfection of

christian disunity the existence of many warring sects raised in an acute form the question of the defini tion of orthodoxy the problem of defining authentic chris tianity raises questions of perennial interest in the history of the church this issue was never more acute than during the second century when the gnostic sects were at their height the translation of the third book of the miscellanies has been made from the text of o stahlin in the berlin corpus 1906 and has been revised by comparison with stahlin's translation in the bibliothek der kirchenvdter 2 reihe band xvii munich 1936 the translation of the seventh book is taken from the edition by f j a hort and joseph b mayor london mac millan 1902 mayor's translation has been revised at some places in accordance with the text of stahlin on marriage miscellanies book iii the text chapter i i the valentinians who hold that the union of man and woman is derived from the divine emanation in heaven above approve of marriage the followers of basilides on the other hand say that when the apostles asked whether it was not better not to marry the lord replied not all can receive this saying there are some eunuchs who are so from their birth others are so of necessity 1 and their explanation of this saying is roughly as follows some men from their birth have a natural sense of repulsion from a woman and those who are naturally so con stituted do well not to marry those who are eunuchs of neces sity are those theatrical ascetics who only control themselves because they have a passion for the limelight and those who have suffered accidental castration have become eunuchs of necessity 2 those then who are eunuchs of necessity have no sound reason for their abstinence from marriage but those who for the sake of the eternal kingdom have made themselves eunuchs derive this idea they say from a wish to avoid the dis tractions involved in marriage because they are afraid of having to waste time in providing for the necessities of life 2 and they say that by the words it is better to marry than to burn 3 the apostle means this do not cast your soul into the fire so that you have to endure night and day and go in fear lest you should fall from continence for a soul which has to 1 matt 19 11 f 2 this sentence may be a scribe's marginal note which has crept into the text the ground for suspecting it is that except here basilides exegesis of matt 19 12 assumes that in all three instances eunuch is used figuratively rather than literally and simply means celibate 3 1 cor 7 9 40 on marriage 41 concentrate upon endurance has lost hope in his ethics isidore says in these very words abstain 4 then from a quarrelsome woman 5 lest you are distracted from the grace of god but when you have rejected the fire of the seed then pray with an undis turbed conscience and when your prayer of thanksgiving he says ce descends to a prayer of request and your request is not that in future you may do right but that you may do no wrong then marry but perhaps a man is too young or poor or suffers from weak health and has not the will to marry as the apostle's saying suggests such a man should not separate himself from his brother christian he should say i have come into the sanc tuary i can suffer nothing and if he has a presentiment that he may fall he may say brother lay your hand on me lest i sin and he will receive help both spiritually and physically let him only wish to accomplish what is right and he will achieve his object 3 sometimes however we say with our mouth e l wish not to sin while our mind is really inclined towards sin such a man does not do what he wishes for fear lest any punishment should be in store for him human nature has some wants which are necessary and natural and others which are only natural to be clothed is necessary and natural sexual intercourse is natural but not necessary 6 i have quoted these remarks to prove in error those basilidians who do not live purely supposing either that they have the power even to commit sin because of their perfection or indeed that they will be saved by nature even if they sin in this life be cause they possess an innate election for the original teachers of their doctrines do not allow one to do the same as they are now doing they ought not therefore to take as a covering cloak the name of christ and by living lewder lives than the most uncontrolled heathen bring blasphemy upon his name tor such people are false apostles deceitful workers as far as the words whose end shall be like their works 7 4 continence is an ignoring of the body in accordance with the confession of faith in god for continence is not merely a matter of sexual abstinence but applies also to the other things for which the soul has an evil desire because it is not satisfied with tjie necessities of life there is also a continence of the tongue of money of use and of desire 8 it does not only teach 4 adopting

the state of abstinence from marriage in those to whom this has been granted by god we admire monogamy and the high standing of single marriage holding that we ought to share suffering with another and bear one another's burdens 10 lest anyone who thinks he stands securely should himself fall 11 it is of second marriage that the apostle says if you burn marry 12 chapter ii 5 but the followers of

was a son of carpocrates and his mother was named alexandria on his father's side he was an alexandrine on his mother's a cephal lenian he lived in all only seventeen years and at same in cephallenia was honoured as a god there a temple of vast blocks of stone was erected and dedicated to him with altars sacred precincts and a museum the cephallenians gather at the temple every new moon and celebrate with sacrifices the day when epiphanes became a god as his birthday they pour libations to him feast in his honour and sing his praises he was educated by his father in the general education and in platon ism and he was instructed in the knowledge of the monad which is the root origin of the carpocratians heresy 14 6 this is what he says then in the book concerning righteous ness the righteousness of god is a kind of universal fairness and equality there is equality in the heaven which is stretched out in all directions and contains the entire earth in its circle the night reveals equally all the stars the light of the sun which is the cause of the daytime and the father of light god pours out from above upon the earth in equal measure on all who have 9 cf strom ill 57 below

irrational animals are not accorded any different treatment but in just the same way god pours out from above sunlight equally upon all the animals he establishes his righteousness to both good and bad by seeing that none is able to get more than his share and to deprive his neighbour so that he has twice the light his neighbour has the sun causes food to grow for all living beings alike the universal righteousness is given to all equally in this respect there is no difference between the entire species of oxen and any individual oxen between the species of pigs and particular pigs between the species of sheep and particular sheep and so on with all the rest in them the universality of god's fairness is manifest furthermore all plants of whatever sort are sown equally in the earth common nourishment grows for all beasts which feed on the earth's produce to all it is alike it is regulated by no law but rather is harmoniously available to all through the gift of him who gives it and makes it to grow 7 and for birth there is no written law for otherwise it would have been transcribed all beings beget and give birth alike having received by god's righteousness an innate equality the creator and father of all with his own righteousness ap pointed this just as he gave equally the eye to all to enable them to see he did not make a distinction between female and male rational and irrational nor between anything and anything else at all rather he shared out sight equally and universally it was given to all alike by a single command as the laws he says could not punish men who were ignorant of them they taught men that they were transgressors but the laws by pre supposing the existence of private property cut up and destroyed the universal equality decreed by the divine law as he does not understand the words of the apostle where he says through the law i knew sin 15 he says that the idea of mine and thine came into existence through the laws so that the earth and money were no longer put to common use and so also with marriage for god has made vines for all to use in common since they are not protected against sparrows and a thief and similarly corn and the other fruits but the abolition contrary to divine law of community of use and equality begat the thief of domestic animals and fruits 8 god made all things for man to be common property 15 rom 7 7 44 clement of he brought female to be with male and in the same way united all animals he thus showed righteousness to be a universal fairness and equality but those who have been born in this way have denied the universality which is the corollary of their birth and say let him who has taken one woman keep her whereas all alike can have her just as the other animals do after this which is quoted word for word he again continues in the same spirit as follows with a view to the permanence of the race he has implanted in males a strong and ardent desire which neither law nor custom nor any other restraint is able to destroy for it is god's decree and how can this man still be reckoned among our number when he openly abolishes both law and gospel by these words the one says thou shalt not commit adultery 16 the other says everyone who looks lustfully has already committed adultery 17 the saying in the law thou shalt not covet 18 shows that one god is proclaimed by law prophets and gospel for it says thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife but for a jew the neighbour is not a jew for he is a brother and has the same spirit therefore it remains that neighbour means one of another race but how can he not be a neighbour who is able to share in the same spirit for abraham is father not only of the hebrews but also of the gentiles 19 9 if the adulteress and he who committed fornication with her are punished with death 20 clearly the command which says thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife speaks of the gen tiles in order that anyone who as the law directs abstains from his neighbour's wife and from his sister may hear clearly from the lord but i say unto you thou shalt not lust the addi tion of the word i however shows the stricter force of the commandment and that carpocrates fights against god and epiphanes likewise the latter in the same notorious book i mean concerning righteousness writes in one passage as follows consequently one must understand the saying c thou shalt not covet as if the lawgiver was making a jest to which he added the even more comic words thy neighbour's goods for he himself who gave the desire to sustain the race orders that it is to be suppressed though he removes it from no other animals and by the words c thy neighbour's wife he says something even more ludicrous since he forces what should be common property to be treated as a private possession 16 exod 20 14 17 matt 5 28 i exod 20 17 w cf rom 4 16 fl gen 17 5 20 cf lev 20 10 deut 22 22 on marriage 45 10 these then are the doctrines of the

have sated their appetites on repletion cypris the goddess of love enters 21 as it is said then they overturn the lamps and so extinguish the light that the shame of their adulterous righteousness is hidden and they have intercourse where they will and with whom they will 23 after they have practised com munity of use in this love feast they demand by daylight of whatever women they wish that they will be obedient to the law of carpocrates it would not be right to say the law of god such i think is the law that carpocrates must have given for the copulations of dogs and pigs and goats he seems to me to have misunderstood the saying of plato in the republic 24 that the women of all are to be common plato means that the unmar ried are common for those who wish to ask them as also the theatre is open to the public for all who wish to see but that when each one has chosen his wife then the married woman is no longer common to all 11 in his book entitled magica xanthus says the magi think it permissible to have sexual intercourse with mothers and daughters and sisters and that wives are to be held in common not by force and in secret but both parties may agree when one man wishes to marry another's wife 25 of these and other similar sects jude i think spoke prophetically in his letter in the same way also these dreamers for they do not seek to find the truth in the light of day as far as the words and their mouth speak arrogant things 26 chapter iii 12 if plato himself and the pythagoreans as indeed later also the followers of marcion 27 regard birth as something evil 21 euripides

garded as evil because it was created out of evil matter and by a just creator on this ground that they do not wish to fill the world made by the creator god they decide to abstain from marriage thus they are in opposition to their maker and hasten towards him who is called the good god but not to the god as they say of the other kind as they wish to leave nothing of their own behind them on this earth they are continent not of their own free choice but from hatred of the creator being un willing to use what he has made but these folk who in their blasphemous fight against god have abandoned natural reason ing and despise the long suffering and goodness of god even if they do not wish to marry use the food made by the creator and breathe his air for they are his works and dwell in his world 28 they say they have received the gospel of the know ledge of the strange god 29 yet at least they ought to acknow ledge gratitude to the lord of the world because they receive this gospel on this earth 13 but we shall give a detailed answer to these people when we discuss the doctrine of first principles 30 the philosophers whom we have mentioned from whom the marcionites blasphemously derived their doctrine that birth is evil on which they then plumed themselves as if it were their own idea do not hold that it is evil by nature but only for the soul which has perceived the truth for they think the soul is divine and has come down here to this world as a place of punishment in their view souls which have become embodied need to be purified but this doctrine is not that of the marcion ites but of those who believe that the souls are enclosed in bodies and change from this prison and undergo transmigra tion there will be an opportunity to reply to these when we come to speak about the soul 31 14 it is clear that heraclitus regards birth as something evil when he says when men are born they are fain to live and suffer death or rather go to their rest and they leave children 28 clement adapts a pagan argument against the christian refusal to wor ship pagan deities cf celsus as quoted by origen contra celsum viii 28 29 cf celsus in origen contra celsum vi 53 30 cf

wept and wailed 35 and further for out of the living he made the dead changing their forms and again o woe unhappy race of mortals wretched men out of what kind of dissensions and groans were you born 33 and the sibyl also says mortal men are ye and fleshly being nothing 34 like the poet who writes earth nurtures nothing weaker than a man 35 15 moreover theognis shows that birth is evil when he speaks as follows for mortals best it is not to be born at all and never to see the rays of the bright sun but if born to pass the gates of hades as soon as possible 36 with this agrees also the tragic poet euripides when he writes when a man is born we ought to assemble only to bewail his lot in coming into so much evil but when one dies and comes to the end of troubles then we should rejoice and praise his happy departure 37 and again he says the same in these words who knows if life be not in truth but death and death be life 38 1 6 herodotus it is clear makes solon say the same

than to dis parage birth and praise death as scattered leaves so is man kind says homer 41 and in the cratylus plato attributes to orpheus the doctrine that the soul in this body is suffering punishment this is what he says some say that the body is a tomb of the soul as being buried in it for the present life and because the soul expresses semainei by this body whatever it may wish to express so it is rightly called a tomb sema the orphics in particular seem to have given it this name as they think the soul suffers punishment for its misdeeds 42 17 it is also worth mentioning the remark of philolaus this pythagorean speaks as follows the ancient theologians and seers testify that the soul is conjoined to the body to suffer cer tain punishments and is as it were buried in this tomb 43 and pindar speaks of the eleusinian mysteries as follows blessed is he who has seen before he goes under the earth for he knows the end of life and knows also its divine beginning 44 similarly in the phaedo plato does not hesitate to write as follows and these men who established our mysteries down to the words and will dwell with the gods and what when he says as long as we have still the body and our soul is involved in such evil shall we never have sufficient possession of that which we desire 45 does he not hint that birth is the cause of the worst evils and in the phaedo he bears witness again all who have rightly been concerned with philosophy run the risk that other men will fail to notice that their sole object is to pursue death and dying 46 18 and in another place accordingly here the soul of the philosopher mostly disregards his body and flees from it and seeks to be existent by itself 47 does he not agree to some ex tent with the divine apostle when he says o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from this body of death 48 un less he speaks of body of death in a figurative sense to refer to the agreement of those who have been enticed into evil and that sexual intercourse as the cause of birth was rejected long before marcion by plato is clear from the first book of the republic for after praising old age he continues mark it well for me the more the other pleasures of the body fade away the 40 herodotus 1 31 cf plutarch solon 27 mor 58 e 41 iliad 6 146 42 pi a to crat 400 bg 43 frag 14 diels 44 frag isya schroder 45 plato phaedo 69 c 66

escaped from it as if i had escaped from a wild and raging tyrant 5 49 19 again in the phaedo he disparages birth when he writes of the doctrine which is secretly taught about this that we men are in a sort of prison and again those who are manifestly distinguished for their holiness of life are liberated from these places on earth and are set free as if this earth were a prison and go to the pure home above nevertheless although he says this he perceives that the administration of this world is good and says one ought not to set oneself free and run away 50 and to sum up briefly he has given marcion no opening for his view that matter is evil when he himself reverently says of the world all that is good the world has received from him who has composed it but from its previous state arise all the recal citrant and unjust things in the heaven and from this it derives these elements and causes them in living beings 20 with even greater clarity he adds the cause of these things was the material element in the world's constitution which was at one time bound up with its ancient nature for before it came into its present ordered state it was in a condition of great chaos 51 to the same effect in the laws he laments the race of men saying the gods had mercy on mankind which was born for trouble and to give them rest from their labours appointed the changing cycle of feasts 52 and in the epinomis he discusses the causes of this pitiful condition and says this from the beginning birth was difficult for every human being first to get to the state of being an embryo then to be born and then to be nourished and educated all this is attended by count less pains as we all agree 53 21 what then does not heraclitus call birth death just as pythagoras and socrates in the gorgias 5 when he says death is what we see when we are awake and what we see in our sleep is a dream 55 but enough of this when we discuss first principles 56 we shall consider the difference between the views of the philo sophers and those of the marcionites but i think i have shown clearly enough that marcion took from plato the starting point 4 rep 328 d 329 c 50 phaedo 62 b 114 bg 5i plato polit y

the birth of children and that the marcionites have interpreted them in a godless sense and are ungrateful to their creator for the tragedy says for mortals it is better not to be born than to be born children i bring to birth with bitter pains and then when i have borne them they lack under standing in vain i groan that i must look on wicked offspring while i lose the good if the good survive my wretched heart is melted by alarm what is this goodness then is it not enough that i should care for one alone and bear the pain for this one soul 58 and further to the same effect so now i think and have long so thought man ought never children to beget seeing into what agonies we are born 59 but in the following verses he clearly attributes the cause of evil to the primal origins when he speaks as follows o thou who art born for misfortune and disaster thou art born a man and thine unhappy life thou didst receive from the place where the air of heaven which gives breath to mortals first began to give food for all complain not of thy mortal state thou who art mortal 60 23 again he puts the same idea in these words no mortal is content and happy nor is any born free from sorrow 61 57

which is happy without end 24 it is asserted that on this ground the pythagoreans exer cised abstinence but to me on the contrary it seems that they marry for the sake of procreating children but after they have begotten children they desire to control sexual indulgence that is why they give the mysterious command to abstain from beans not because pulse leads to flatulence and is indigestible and causes troubled dreams 64 nor because the bean is shaped like a man's head as the verse has it it is alike to eat beans and the head of one's parents 5 65 the real reason is that if beans are eaten they make women barren at any rate theophrastus in the fifth book of his causes of plants 6 relates that if the pods of beans are put round the roots of newly planted trees the shoots dry up and that if birds that live round houses are continuously fed on beans they become unable to lay eggs chapter iv 25 of the heretics we mentioned marcion of pontus as for bidding the use of this world's goods on the ground of opposi tion to the creator the creator himself is thus the reason for his continence if this can be called continence for this giant who thinks he can resist god is not continent by an act of free choice in that he attacks the creation and the process by which man is formed if they quote the lord's words to philip let the dead bury their dead but do thou follow me 67

he was accused before the apostles of jealousy he brought his wife into the concourse and allowed anyone who so desired to marry her for they say this action was appropriate to the saying one must abuse the flesh 55 those who share his heresy follow both his action and his words simply and without qualification by indulging in the gravest enormity 26 i am informed however that nicolaus never had rela tions with any woman other than the wife he married and that of his children his daughters remained virgins to their old age and his son remained uncorrupted in view of this it was an act of suppression of passion when he brought before the apostles the wife on whose account he was jealous he taught what it meant to abuse the flesh by restraining the distracting pas sions for as the lord commanded 69 he did not wish to serve two masters pleasure and god it is said that matthias also taught that one should fight the flesh and abuse it never allow ing it to give way to licentious pleasure so that the soul might grow by faith and knowledge 70 27 there are some who call aphrodite pandemos 11 i.e physical love a mystical communion this is an insult to the name of communion to do

licentiousness and whether they themselves i mean the authors of the book are responsible see their madness for by their licence they do grievous wrong to god or whether they derived their ideas from some others whom they fell in with they have taken a sound doctrine and perversely misapplied it the passage reads as follows all things were one but as it seemed good to its unity not to be alone an idea came forth from it and it had intercourse with it and made the beloved in consequence of this there came forth from him an idea with which he had inter course and made powers which cannot be seen

even what they can do they do not like kings but like cringing slaves for it is only in secret that they commit adultery as they are scared of being caught they want to avoid condemnation and are afraid of punishment what free dom is there in their licence and filthy talk everyone who sins is a slave 78 says the apostle 31 the lord has said but i say unto you 3 you shall not lust 79 how then can he live according to god's will who sur renders himself to every desire and is a man to decide of his own free will that he can sin and lay it down as a principle that one may commit adultery and revel in sin and break up other men's marriages when we even take pity on others if they fall into sin against their will and if they regard the world into which they have come as an alien country they will not possess the truth if they have not been faithful in that which is an other's 80 does a foreign visitor insult the citizens and do them injury does he not rather behave as a guest 81 and conform to the necessary rules living without causing offence to the citizens and how can they say that they alone know god when they do the same things as those who are loathed by the heathen because they do not do what the laws direct that is as the wicked and incontinent and covetous and adulterous they ought to live good lives even while they are dwelling in an alien country to manifest their truly kingly nature 32 but because they have chosen to disobey the laws they make themselves objects of hatred both to human lawgivers and to the law of god at any rate in numbers the man who thrust his spear into the fornicator is evidently blessed by god 82 and john says in his epistle if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in

in my opinion of like nature those who think they are superior to others by their nobility of birth ought to be superior to them also in their moral characters that they may escape incarceration in the prison 84 for indeed as the lord said except your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and pharisees you shall not enter the kingdom of god 85 however abstinence from food is exemplified in the book of daniel 86 and to sum up in a word concerning obedi ence david speaks in the psalms how shall a young man cor rect his way and at once he hears by keeping thy word with his whole heart 87 and jeremiah says thus saith the lord you shall not walk in the ways of the heathen 88 34 because of this certain other depraved and worthless fellows have been impelled to assert that man was formed by various powers and that down as far as the navel his body shows the work of godlike craftsmanship but his lower parts indicate inferior workmanship 89 in consequence of the latter man has a sexual impulse they fail to observe that the upper parts also want food and in some men are lustful and they contradict christ when he said to the pharisees that the same god made both our outer and our inner man 90 moreover de sire is not a bodily thing though it occurs because of the body 91 certain others whom we may call antitactae i.e opponents assert that the god of the universe is our father by nature and all that he has made is good but one of the beings made by him sowed tares and so caused the origin of evils he involved us all in them and so made us opponents of the father therefore even we ourselves are set in opposition to him to avenge the father and act contrary to the will of the second since then the latter has said thou shalt not commit adultery 92 let us say they commit

patience longsuffering and other such virtues whether they think them bad or good if the command is bad which forbids one to do almost all that is disgraceful then evil must enact laws against itself in order to destroy its own fruit which is impossible if it is good by oppos ing good commandments they must confess that they are opposing what is right and doing wrong 36 but the saviour himself whom alone they think one should obey has forbidden hatred and reviling 94 and says when you go with your adversary to court try to achieve a friendly reconciliation with him 95 accordingly they will either refuse to accept christ's exhortation in that they are in opposition to the adversary or they will become his friends and cease to oppose him what then do you not realize my worthy friends i speak as if you were present with me that by conflict with these excellent commandments you fight against your own salvation you overturn yourselves not these beneficial instruc tions the lord said

thou shalt not corrupt boys 97 and all the commandments enjoining purity which through your incontinence you seek to destroy why do you not abolish winter which he made and make it summer when it is

down to graven images are you not blas phemous therefore whfen you oppose as you say the creator and endeavour to do the same as fornicators and adulterers do you not perceive that you make him all the greater whom you regard as weak if what is taking place is what he wishes and not what the good god wills for on the contrary your father as you call him is shown to be weak by you yourselves 38 these folk also collect extracts from the prophets making a selection and mischievously stringing them together they interpret in a literal sense sayings intended to be understood allegorically it is written they say they resisted god and were saved 7 but they add the shameless god and interpret this saying as if it gave them advice thinking it will bring them salvation if they resist the creator in fact scripture does not mention the shameless god and if it did you fools you should have understood the word shameless to refer to him who is called the devil either because he slanders men or be cause he accuses sinners or because he is an apostate the people to whom the passage refers were unwilling to be punished for their sins and they spoke the words quoted in a spirit of com plaining and grumbling on the ground that other nations were not punished when they transgressed and that on every occasion they alone were humiliated so that even jeremiah said why is the way of the ungodly easy 8 similar in sense to this is the saying in malachi which has been quoted they resisted god and were saved in uttering their oracles the prophets do not only say that they have heard some message from god it is also evident that they take up phrases in common use among the people and reply to them as if they were reporting certain ques tions raised by them the saying under discussion is an instance of this 39 perhaps it is such people that the apostle attacks in the epistle to the romans when he writes and not as we are blas phemously accused and some assert that we say let us do evil that good may come an argument which is rightly con demned 9 these are they who when reading the bible pervert ex 22 1 5 deut 6 5 6 deut 27 15 7 mai 3 15 8 jen 12 1 9 rom 3 8 58 clement of alexandria the sense

words 35 says malachi have even said wherein have we provoked him in this that you have said anyone who does evil is good in the lord's sight and he is well pleased with them and where is the god of righteousness 11 chapter v 40 it is not our aim to pursue this subject in further detail and to mention further senseless heresies to put them to shame we should be forced to deal with each one and to state our objec tions to each point which would extend these notes to an un conscionable length accordingly we may divide all the heresies into two groups in making answer to them either they teach that one ought to live on the principle that it is a matter of in difference whether one does right or wrong or they set a too ascetic tone and proclaim the necessity of continence on the ground of opinions which are godless and arise from hatred of what god has created first we may discuss the former group if it is lawful to live any sort of life one likes obviously one may live in continence or if any kind of life has no dangers for the elect obviously one of virtue and self control is far less danger ous if the lord of the sabbath 12 has been given the right to pass uncorrected if he lives an immoral life a fortiori there will be no correction for him who behaves decently all things are lawful but all things are not expedient 13 says the apostle if all things are lawful obviously this includes self control 41 therefore if one who uses his power to live a virtuous life receives praise then much more worthy of reverence and honour is he who has given us this free and sovereign power and has allowed us to live as we choose not allowing us to become en slaved and subjected to necessity by our acts of choice and rejec tion but if both can have no anxiety he who chooses incontin ence and he who chooses abstinence yet the honour is not equal he who indulges his pleasures gratifies his body but he who is controlled liberates from its passions his soul which is master of the body and if they tell us that we are called to freedom only let us not use our freedom as an opportunity for the flesh as the 1 for the accentuation of the scriptures cf epiphanius de mens et pond 2 11 mai 2 17 12 matt 12 8 cf strom iii 30 above 1 i cor 6 12 10 23 on marriage 59 apostle says 14 if lust is to be gratified and a life of sin regarded as morally neutral as they say either we ought to indulge our desires in every direction and if this is our desire do the most lascivious and immoral acts in that we are following our in stincts in every way or we may suppress certain desires and live no longer a life which recognizes no distinction of right and wrong nor be absolute slaves to our most dishonourable mem bers the stomach and the private parts gratifying our carcase for the sake of desire for desire is nourished and invigorated if it is encouraged in indulgence just as on the other hand it loses strength if it is kept in check 42 but how is it possible to become like the lord and have knowledge of god if one is subject to physical pleasures every pleasure is the consequence of an appetite and an appetite is a certain pain and anxiety caused by need which requires some object 15 in my opinion those who choose this kind of life are simply suffering pain to their shame as the well known verse puts it 1 6 choosing evil which they bring upon themselves 1 7 now and hereafter if then all things were lawful and one need have no fear that because of one's wicked deeds one's hope of salvation would be lost perhaps they might have some excuse for living this wicked and wretched life but through the com mandments a life of blessedness is shown to us we must all keep to them without misinterpreting any of the words or neglecting any of our duties however minute we must follow where the word leads and if we depart from it we must fall into endless evil 18 and by following the divine scripture the path by which believers travel we are to be made like unto the lord as far as possible we must not live as if there were no difference between right and wrong but to the best of our power must purify ourselves from indulgence and lust and take care for our soul which must continually be devoted to the deity alone for when it is pure and set free from all evil the mind is somehow capable of receiving the power of god and the divine image is set up in it and everyone who has this hope in the lord puri fies himself says the scripture even as he is pure 19 43 to attain the knowledge of god is impossible for those who are still under the control of their passions therefore they n cf gal 5 13 is a traditional dictionary definition cf andronicus de affect p 124 kreuttner 16 hesiod works and days an 17 homer odyssey 18 73 is homer odyssey 12 118 19

ignorant of god and ignorance of god is shown by a man's manner of life it is abso lutely impossible at the same time to be a man of understanding and not to be ashamed to gratify the body nor can the view that pleasure is the supreme good be reconciled with the view that only the beautiful is good or that only the lord is beau tiful and god alone is good and is alone to be loved you are circumcised in christ with a circumcision not done with hands which consists rather in the putting away of the carnal body in the circumcision of christ if you then are risen with christ seek those

members fornication uncleanness pas sion lust for on account of these wrath is coming let them also therefore put away anger wrath wickedness blasphemy filthy talk from their mouth putting off the old man with its lusts and putting on the new man which is renewed to possess full knowledge according to the image of him who created it 20 44 it is the manner of life which shows up those who know the commandments for as a man's word is so is his life the tree is known by its fruit 21 not by its blossom and leaves know ledge then comes from the fruit and from behaviour not from talk and from blossom we say that knowledge is not mere talk but a certain divine knowledge that light which is kindled in the soul as a result of obedience to the commandments and which reveals all that is in a state of becoming enables man to know himself and teaches him to become possessed of god what the eye is in the body knowledge is in the mind 22 let them not call bondage to pleasure freedom as if bitterness were sweet we have learnt to recognize as freedom that which the lord alone confers on us when he liberates us from lusts and desires and the other passions he who says i know the lord and

continence both the creation and the holy creator the almighty only god and teach that one must reject marriage and begetting of children and should not bring others in their place to live in this wretched world nor give any sus tenance to death our reply is as follows we may first quote the word of the apostle john and now are many antichrists come whence we know that it is the last hour they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would have remained with us 24 next we may destroy their case on the ground that they pervert the sense of the books they quote as follows when salome asked the lord how long shall death hold sway he answered as long as you women bear chil dren 25 her words do not imply that this life is evil and the creation bad and his reply only teaches the ordinary course of nature for birth is invariably followed by death 26 46 the task of the law is to deliver us from a dissolute life and all disorderly ways its purpose is to lead us from unright eousness to righteousness so that it would have us self con trolled in marriage in begetting children and in general be haviour the lord is not come to destroy the law but to fulfil it 27 to fulfil does not imply that it was defective but that by his coming the prophecies of the law are accomplished since before the law the demand for right conduct was proclaimed by the logos to those also who lived good lives the multitude who know nothing of continence live for the body not for the spirit but the body without spirit is earth and ashes 28 now the lord judges adultery which is only committed in thought 29 what then is it not possible to remain continent even in the married state and not to seek to put asunder what god has joined together 30 for such is the teaching of those who divide the yoke of marriage by reason of whom the christian name is blasphemed if it is the view of these people who themselves owe their existence to sexual relations that such relations are 241 john

sanctified by the husband and the husband by the wife 31 and what is the meaning of the lord's words to those who asked concerning divorce whether it is lawful to put away one's wife as moses commanded because of the hardness of your hearts he says moses wrote this but have you not read that god said to the first man you two shall be one flesh therefore he who divorces his wife except for fornication makes her an adulteress 32 but after the resurrection he says they neither marry nor are given in marriage 33 moreover concerning the belly and itsfood it is written food is for the belly and the belly for food but god shall destroy both the one and the other 34 in this saying he attacks those who think they can live like wild pigs and goats lest they should indulge their physical appetites without restraint 48 if as they say they have already attained the state of resurrection 35 and on this account reject marriage let them neither eat nor drink for the apostle says that in the resurrec tion the belly and food shall be destroyed why then do they hunger and thirst and suffer the weaknesses of the flesh and all the other needs which will not affect the man who through christ has attained to the hoped for resurrection furthermore those who worship idols abstain both from food and from sexual intercourse 36 but the kingdom of god does not consist in eat ing and drinking 37 he says and indeed the magi make a point of abstaining from wine and the meat of animals and from sexual intercourse while they are worshipping angels and daemons 38 but just as humility consists in meekness and not in treating one's body roughly so also continence is a virtue of the soul which is not manifest to others but is in secret 49 there are some who say outright that marriage

not know the reason why the lord did not marry in the first place he had his own bride the church and in the next place he was no ordinary man that he should also be in need of some helpmeet 41 after the flesh nor was it necessary for him to beget children since he abides eter nally and was born the only son of god it is the lord himself who says that which god has joined together let no man put asunder 42 and again as it was in the days of noah they were marrying and giving in marriage building and planting and as it was in the days of lot so shall be the coming of the son of man 43 and to show that he is not referring to the heathen he adds when the son of man is come shall he find faith on the earth 44 and again woe to those who are with child and are giving suck in those days 45 a saying i admit to be understood allegorically the reason why he did not determine the times which the father has appointed by his own power 46 was that the world might continue from generation to generation 50 concerning the words not all can receive this saying there are some eunuchs who were born so and some who were made eunuchs by men and some who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven let him receive it who can receive it 47 they do not realize the context after his word about divorce some asked him whether if that is the position in relation to woman it is better not to marry and it was then that the lord said not all can receive this saying but those to whom it is granted what the questioners wanted to know was whether when a man's wife has been condemned for fornication it is allowable for him to marry another it is said however that several athletes abstained from sexual intercourse exercising continence to keep their bodies in train ing as astylos of croton and crison of himera 45 even the cithara player amoebeus though newly married kept away from his bride 49 and aristotle of gyrene was the only man to disdain the love of lais when she fell for hinu 40 james 4 6 i peter 5 5 gen 2 18 4 matt 19 6 43 matt 24 37 39 44 luke 18 8 4 matl 24 19 46 acts 1 7 47 matt 19 11 4 plato lawsy 840 a and the scholiast thereon 4 the same story in

when she had rendered it he kept his oath in an amusing manner by painting the closest possible likeness of her and setting it up in gyrene the story is told by istros in his book on the peculiarity of athletic contests 50 therefore there is nothing meritorious about abstinence from marriage unless it arises from love to god at any rate the blessed paul says of those who revile marriage in the last times some shall depart from the faith turning to spirits of error and doctrines inspired by daemons forbidding to marry and commanding abstinence from food 51 and again he says let no one disqualify you by demanding self imposed ascetic practices and severe treatment of the body 52 and the same writer has this also are you bound to a wife do not seek to be separated from her are you free from any wife do not seek to find one and again let every man have his own wife lest satan tempt you 5 53 52 how then did not the righteous in ancient times partake of what god made with thanksgiving some begat children and lived chastely in the married state to elijah the ravens brought bread and meat for food 54 and samuel the prophet brought as food for saul the remnant of the thigh of which he had already eaten 55 but whereas they say that they are superior to them in behaviour and conduct they cannot even be compared with them in their deeds he who does not eat then let him not despise him who eats and he who eats let him not judge him who does not eat for god has accepted him 56 moreover the lord says of himself john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he has a devil the son of man came eating and drinking and they say behold a gluttonous man and a wine bibber a friend of publicans and a sinner 57 or do they also scorn the apostles peter and philip had children and philip gave his daughters in marriage 53 even paul did not hesitate in one letter to address his consort 58 the only reason why he did not take her about with him was that it would have

their wives with them not as women with whom they had marriage relations but as sisters that they might be their fellow ministers in dealing with housewives it was through them that the lord's teaching penetrated also the women's quarters without any scandal being aroused we also know the directions about women deacons which are given by the noble paul in his second letter to timothy 60 furthermore the self same man cried aloud that the kingdom of god does not con sist in food and drink 53 not indeed in abstinence from wine and meat but in righteousness peace and joy in the holy spirit 61 which of them goes about like elijah clad in a sheepskin and a leather girdle which of them goes about like isaiah naked ex cept for a piece of sacking and without shoes or clothed merely in a linen loincloth like jeremiah 62 which of them will imitate john's gnostic way of life the blessed prophets also lived in this manner and were thankful to the creator 54 the righteousness of carpocrates however and those like him who pursue immoral communion 53 is to be refuted by an argument along the following lines immediately after the words give to him that asks you he continues and do not turn away from him who wishes to borrow 63 thus it is this kind of communion which he is teaching not the immoral kind how can there be one who asks and receives and borrows unless there is someone who possesses and gives and lends what then is the position when the lord says i was hungry and you fed me i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me after which he adds inasmuch as you did it to one of these little ones you did it to me 64 and does he not lay down the same principle in the old testament he who gives to the poor lends to god and do not avoid giving to the needy 65 he says 55 and again let not your almsgiving and faithfulness lapse and poverty brings a man low but the hands of the energetic are made rich and he adds behold the man who has not given his money on usury is accepted and does he not 59 i cor 9 5 n i tim 5 9 f rom 14 17 i kings 19 13 ii kings 1 8 isa 20 2 jer 13 1 3 matt 5 42 cf strom ill 27 above 64

has kept all the commandments from his youth up for he had not fulfilled thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself only then was he taught by the lord who wished to make him perfect to give for love's sake 56 accordingly he has not forbidden us to be rich in the right way but only a wrongful and insatiable grasping of money for property gained unlawfully is diminished there are some who sow much and gain the more and those who hoard become impoverished of them it is written he distributed he gave to the poor his righteousness endures for ever 6 for he who sows and gathers more is the man who by giving away his earthly and temporal goods has obtained a heavenly and eternal prize the other is he who gives to no one but vainly lays up treasure on earth where moth and rust corrupt of him it is written in gathering money he has gathered it into a condemned cell 69 of his land the lord says in the gospel that it produced plentifully then wishing to store the fruits he built larger store houses saying to himself in the words dramatically put into his mouth you have many good things laid up for many years to come eat drink and be merry you fool says the lord this night your soul shall be required of you whose then shall be the things you have prepared 33 7 chapter vii 57 the human ideal of continence i mean that which is set forth by greek philosophers teaches that one should fight desire and not be subservient to it so as to bring it to practical effect but our ideal is not to experience desire at alli our aim is not that while a man feels desire he should get the better of it but that he should be continent even respecting desire itself this chastity cannot be attained in any other way except by god's grace that was why he said ask and it shall be given you 71 this grace

than desire and is quiescent so far as bodily action is concerned union takes place in thought with the object of desire although that object is not present 58 our general argument concerning marriage food and other matters may proceed to show that we should do nothing from desire our will is to be directed only towards that which is necessary for we are children not of desire but of will 73 a man who marries for the sake of begetting children must prac tise continence so that it is not desire he feels for his wife whom he ought to love and that he may beget children with a chaste and controlled will for we have learnt not to have thought for the flesh to fulfil its desires 53 we are to walk honourably as in the way that is in christ and in the enlightened conduct of the lord's way not in revelling and drunkenness not in de bauchery and lasciviousness not in strife and envy 74 59 however one ought to consider continence not merely in relation to one form of it that is sexual relations but in relation to all the other indulgences for which the soul craves when it is ill content with what is necessary and seeks for luxury it is con tinence to despise money softness property to hold in small esteem outward appearance to control one's tongue to master evil thoughts in the past certain angels became incontinent and were seized by desire so that they fell from heaven to earth 75 and valentine says in the letter to agathopus 76 jesus endured all things and was continent it was his endeavour to earn a divine nature he ate and drank in a manner peculiar to him self and the food did not pass out of his body such was the power of his continence that food was not corrupted within him for he himself was not subject to the process of corruption as for ourselves we set high value on continence which arises from love to the lord and seeks that which is good for its own sake sanctifying the temple of the spirit it is good if for the sake of the kingdom of heaven a man emasculates himself from all desire and purifies his conscience from dead works to serve the living god 77 72 ex 24 18 73 cf john i i3 74 r m 13 13 14 75 gen 6 2 cf clement paedag ill 14 2 strom v 10

but some of them take food every way as we do while others do so only on every third day as alexander polyhistor says in his indian history 1 they despise deaths and reckon life of no account for they are persuaded that there is a regeneration the gods 79 they worship are heracles and pan and the indians who are called holy men go naked throughout their entire life they seek for the truth and predict the future and reverence a certain pyramid beneath which they think lie the bones of a certain god 80 neither the gymnosophists nor the so called holy men have wives they think sexual relations are unnatural and contrary to law for this cause they keep themselves chaste the holy women are also virgins they observe it seems the heavenly bodies and from what they indicate foretell future events chapter viii 6 1 those who hold that for them there is no difference between right and wrong force a few passages of scripture and think they favour their own immoral opinions in particular they quote the saying sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace 5 and others of this sort which there is no reason to add for i am not proposing to fit out a pirate ship let us then briefly put a stop to their argument the noble apostle himself refutes the charge against him implied in their false exegesis by the words with which he continues

shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid 3 81 in this in spired and prophetic way he at once destroys the device of these licentious sophists 62 they fail to understand it seems that we must all stand before the judgment seat of christ that each man may be re warded for what he has done with his body whether it is good or bad that is in order that a man may receive his reward for what he has done by means of his body so then if any man be in christ he is a new creation no longer inclined to sin old things are passed away we have washed off the old life behold new things have happened 82 there is chastity instead of fornication continence instead of incontinence righteousness instead of unrighteousness what is there in com mon between righteousness and lawlessness or what fellowship between light and darkness or what harmony between christ and belial what community is there between a believer and an unbeliever what agreement between the temple of god and idols having then these promises let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear ofgod 83 chapter ix 63 those who are opposed to god's creation disparaging it under the fair name of continence also quote the words to salome which we mentioned earlier 84 they are found i believe in the gospel according to the egyptians they say that the saviour himself said i came to destroy the works of the female mean ing by female desire and by works birth and corruption what then would they say has this destruction in fact been accomplished they could not say so for the world continues exactly as before yet the lord did not lie for in truth he did destroy the works of desire love of money contentiousness vanity mad lust for women paederasty gluttony licentious ness and similar vices their birth is the soul's corruption since then we are dead in sins 85 and this is the incontinence re ferred to as female birth and the corruption chiefly involved in the creation must necessarily continue until the achievement of complete separation and the restoration of the elect on whose account even the beings mingled with this world are restored to their proper condition si rom 6 14 15 82 ii cor 5 10 17 sa h cor 6 14 16 7 1 s4 cf strom ill 45 above eph 2 5 70 clement of alexandria 64 it is probably therefore with reference to the consumma tion that salome says until when shall men die 5 the scrip ture uses the word man in two senses the outward man and the soul 86 and again of him who is being saved and him who is not and sin is said to be the death of the soul that is why the lord gave a cautious answer as long as women bear chil dren that is as long as the desires are active therefore as through one man sin entered into the world and through sin death came to all men in that all sinned and death reigned from adam to moses 87 says the apostle by natural necessity in the divine plan death follows birth and the coming together of soul and body is followed by their dissolution 88 if birth exists for the sake of learning and knowledge dissolution leads to the final restoration as woman is regarded as the cause of death because she brings to birth so also for the same reason she may be called the originator of life 65 in fact the woman who first began transgression was named life 89 because she became responsible for the succes sion of those who were born and fell into sin the mother of righteous and unrighteous alike since each one of us makes him self either righteous or disobedient on this account i for my part do not think the apostle was expressing disgust at life in the flesh when he said but with all boldness both now and ever christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or by death for to me to live is christ and to die is gain if however it is to be life in the flesh that also means for me fruitful work i do not know which i prefer i am constrained on both sides i have a desire to depart and to be with christ which is far better but to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sakes 90 here he showed clearly i think that the perfect reason for departing from the body is love for god and that if one is to be in the flesh one should thankfully remain here for the sake of those who need salvation 66 but why do they not go on to quote the words after those spoken to salome these people who do anything rather than walk according to the truly evangelical rule for when she says i would have done better had i never given birth to a child suggesting that she might not have been right in giving birth to a child the lord replies to her saying eat of every plant but eat not of that which has bitterness in it for by this saying also he indicates that whether we are continent or married is a matter 8 ii cor 4 16 s rom 5 12 14 88 c plato phaedo 67 d gen 3 20 w phi 1 20 24 on marriage 71 for our free choice and that there is no absolute prohibition which would impose continence upon us as a necessity and he further makes it clear that marriage is co operation with the work of creation 67 therefore a man ought not to think that marriage on rational principles is a sin supposing that he does not look on the bringing up of children as being bitter on the contrary to many childlessness is most grievous but if a man regards the rearing of children as bitter because it distracts him from the things of god on account of the time it takes up he may yet desire to marry because he does not take easily to a bachelor's life what he wants to do is not harmful if it is done with self control and each one of us is master of his own will in deciding whether to beget children but i am aware that because of mar riage there are some who have kept clear of it and against the principles of holy knowledge have lapsed into hatred of human ity so that the spirit of charity has departed from them there are others who have become absorbed by marriage and fulfil their desires in the indulgence which the law permits 91 and as the prophet says have become like beasts 92 chapter x 68 but who are the two or three gathered in the name of christ in whose midst the lord is 93 does he not by the three mean husband wife and child 94 for a wife is bound to her husband by god 95 if however a man wishes to be undistracted and prefers to avoid begetting children because of the business it in volves let him remain unmarried says the apostle even as i am 96 they explain that what the lord meant was this by the plurality he means the creator the god who is the cause of the world's existence and by the one the elect he meant the saviour who is son of another god the good god but this is not correct through his son god is with those who are soberly married and have children by the same mediation the same god is also with the man who exercises continence on rational grounds according to another view the three may be passion desire 9i the greek phrase occurs in an epicurean fragment on papyrus p oxy 215 92 ps 48 13 21 93 matt 18 20 94 cf origen comm in matt 14 2 95 prov 19 14 96 i cor 7 8 72 clement of alexandria and thought 97 another interpretation makes them flesh soul and spirit 98 69 perhaps the triad mentioned refers to the called and in the second place to the chosen and in the third place to the race appointed to receive the greatest honour with them is the power of god watching over all things which is indivisibly divided among them he then who uses the soul's natural powers as is right desires those things which are appropriate and hates what is harmful as the commandments prescribe thou shalt bless him who blesses thee and curse him who curses thee 1 but when he has risen above these passion and desire and in very deed has begun to love the creation of the god and creator of all things then he will live a gnostic life as he has become like the saviour and has attained to a state of continence no longer maintained with difficulty he has united knowledge faith and love thenceforth he is one in his judg ment and truly spiritual wholly incapable of thoughts arising from passion and desire one who is to be made perfect after the image of the lord by the artist himself a perfect man already worthy to be called a brother to the lord 2 as well as his friend and son thus the two and the three come together into one and the same thing a gnostic man 70 the agreement of many which is indicated by the num ber three with whom the lord is present might also be the one church the one man and the one race or could it mean this the lord when he gave the law was with the one that is the jew later when he inspired the prophets and sent jeremiah to babylon 3 and moreover called believers from the gentiles by the teaching of the prophets he brought the two peoples to gether and was not the third the one which is made out of the two into a new man 4 in which he walks and dwells in the church itself 5 and the law the prophets and also the gospel were brought together in christ's name into a single knowledge accordingly those who from hatred do not marry or from desire use the flesh as if it were not a matter of right and wrong 6 are not in the number of the saved with whom the lord is present s 7 cf clement paedag ill 1 2 strom ill 93 below 98 i thess 5 23 quoted with the same

of these matters being concluded let us now quote all the scriptures which oppose these heretical sophists and show the right rule of continence that is preserved on grounds of reason the man of understanding will find out the particular scripture which deals with each individual heresy and at the right time will quote it to refute those who teach doctrines contrary to the commandments right from the beginning the law as we have already said 7 lays down the com mand thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife 8 long be fore the lord's closely similar utterance in the new testament where the same idea is expressed in his own mouth you have heard that the law commanded thou shalt not commit adultery but i say thou shalt not lust 9 that the law intended husbands to cohabit with their wives with self control and only for the purpose of begetting children is evident from the pro hibition which forbids the unmarried man from having im mediate sexual relations with a captive woman 10 if the man has conceived a desire for her he is directed to mourn for thirty days while she is to have her hair cut if after this the desire has not passed off then they may proceed to beget children because the appointed period enables the overwhelming impulse to be tested and to become a rational act of will 72 for this reason you could not point to any place in scrip ture where one of the ancients approached a pregnant woman 1 1 later after the child is born and weaned you might find that mar riage relations of husbands and wives were resumed you will find that moses father kept this principle in mind after aaron's birth three years passed before moses was born 12 again the tribe of levi observed this law of nature given by god although they were fewer in number than any others which came into the promised land 13 for a tribe does not easily grow to great num bers if their men have intercourse only within the legal marriage relationship and then wait until the end not only of pregnancy but also of breast feeding 73 it was therefore reasonable when moses in his attempt to bring the jews to continence by degrees directed that after sexual intercourse they must abstain for three days before they 7 strom ill 9 ex 20 17 9 matt 10 dcut 21 11 13 cf strom ii 88 89 cf paedag ii 92 12 ex 7 7 13 num 3 39 74 clement of alexandria heard the divine words 14 we are god's temples as the

the church wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and be to you a father and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty 15 he prophetically commands us to be separate not from those who are married as they assert but from the heathen who are still living in immorality and also from the heretics we have men tioned as unclean and godless persons 74 hence paul speaks against people who are like those i have mentioned saying you have then these promises be loved let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god 16 for i am jeal ous for you with a divine jealousy for i betrothed you to one husband to present a pure virgin to christ 17 the

the serpent in his craftiness deceived eve so also your thoughts may be corrupted from the simplicity which is toward christ 19 said the apostle as a very careful and conscientious teacher 75 so also the admirable peter says beloved i exhort you as strangers and pilgrims to abstain from carnal lusts which war against the soul and conduct yourselves well among the heathen for this is the will of god that by doing good you should put to silence the activity of foolish men as free and not using your freedom as a covering for evil but as god's slaves 20 likewise also paul in the epistle to the romans writes we who are dead to sin how shall we any longer live in it because our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed down to the words do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin 21 76 while on this point i think i must not omit mention of the fact that the apostle declares that the same god is the god of the law the prophets and the gospel in the 4 epistle to the romans he quotes the gospel saying thou shalt not lust as i ex 19 15 is ii cor 6 16 18 w ii cor 7 1 n ii con 11 2 is cf strom ill 4 82 w ii cor 11 3 20 i peter 2 1 1 f

not known sin except through the law and i had not known lust unless the law had said thou shalt not lust 22 even if the heretics who are op posed to the creator suppose that in the next sentence paul was speaking against him when he says i know that in me that is in my flesh there dwells no good thing 5 yet let them read what precedes and follows this for before it he says but sin which dwells in me which explains why it was appropriate for him to say in my flesh dwells no good thing 23 77 in what follows he continues but if i do that which i do not wish to do it is no longer i that do it but sin which dwells in me which being at war with the law of god and of my mind he says makes me captive by the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from this body of death 24 and again for he does not be come in the least weary of being helpful he does not hesitate to add for the law of the spirit has set me free from the law of sin and death since by his son god condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit 25 in addition to this he makes the point still clearer by saying emphatically the body is dead because of sin indicating that if it is not the temple 26 it is still the tomb of the soul 27 for when it is dedi cated to god he adds the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead dwells in you who shall also make alive your mortal bodies through his spirit dwelling in you 28 78 again his remarks are directed against libertines when he continues as follows the mind of the flesh is death because those who live according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh and the mind of the flesh is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god those who are in the flesh cannot please god not in the sense in which some teach but in the sense which we have already explained then by contrast to this he says to the church but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if the spirit of god dwells in you if any man has not christ's spirit he is none of his but if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin the spirit is life because of righteousness so then brethren we are under an obligation not to the flesh 22 rom 7 7 23 rom 7 17 18 24 rom 7 20 23 f 25 rom 8 2 4 26 gf i cor 3 16 6 19 27 cf plato crat 9 400 bc cf strom ill 16 28

a time to give opportunity for prayer 32 this teaches continence he adds the words by agreement lest anyone should dissolve his marriage and the words for a time lest a married man brought to continence by force should then fall into sin for if he spares his own wife he may fall into desire for another woman on this principle he said that the man who thinks he is not be having properly if he brings up his daughter to be unmarried does right to give her in marriage 33 whether a man becomes a celibate or whether he joins himself in marriage with a woman for the sake of having children his purpose ought to be to re main unyielding to what is inferior if he can live a life of intense devotion he will gain to himself great merit with god 34 since his continence is both pure and reasonable but if he goes be yond the rule he has chosen to gain greater glory there is a danger that he may lose hope 35 both celibacy and marriage have their own different forms of service and ministry to the lord i have in mind the caring for one's wife and children for it seems that the particular characteristic of the married state is that it gives the man who desires a perfect marriage

she remains as she is 3 40 moreover in the former passage he says you are dead to the law not to marriage that you may belong to another who was raised from the dead as bride and church the church

almighty god lest as the serpent deceived eve 41 who is called life 42 we too should be led to transgress the command ments by the lewd craftiness of the sects the second passage teaches single marriage one should not suppose as some have expounded the text that when paul says the wife is bound to her husband he means that flesh is involved in corruption 43 he is attacking the notion of the godless men who attribute the inven tion of marriage directly to the devil 44 a notion which danger ously blasphemes the lawgiver 8 1 i believe tatian the syrian made bold to teach these doctrines at any rate he writes these words in his book on per fection according to the saviour 5 while agreement to be con tinent makes prayer possible 46 intercourse of corruption des troys it by the very disparaging way in which he allows it he forbids it 47 for although he allowed them to come together again because of satan and the temptation to incontinence he indicated that the man who takes

and the devil 55 this he says in expounding the apostle but he falsifies the truth in that by means of what is true he tries to prove what is untrue we too confess that incontinence and fornication are diabolical passions but the agreement of a controlled marriage occupies a middle position if the married couple agree to be continent it helps them to pray if they agree with reverence to have sexual relations it leads them to beget children in fact the right time to procreate is said in scripture to be knowledge 49 since it says and adam knew his wife eve and she conceived and bore a son and they called him by the name of seth for god has raised up for me other seed instead of abel 50 you see who is the object of the blasphemy of those who abuse sober marriage and attribute birth to the devil the scripture here does not speak simply of a god but of the god indicating the almighty by the addition of the definite article 82 the point of the apostle's addition and then come to gether again because of satan is to stop the husband from ever turning aside after other women a temporary agreement al though for the moment intercourse is not approved does not mean that the natural instincts are completely removed because of them he again restores the marriage bond not so that hus band and wife may be incontinent and fornicate and do the devil's work but to prevent them from falling into incontinence fornication and the devil tatian also separates the old man and the new 51 but not as we understand it we agree with him that the law is the old man and the gospel the new and say the same ourselves but not in the sense in which he takes it since he would do away with the law as originating from another god but it is the same man and lord who makes the old new by no longer allowing several marriages for at that time god 52 required it when men had to increase and multiply and by teaching single marriage for the sake of begetting children and looking after domestic affairs for which purpose woman was given as a helpmeet 5 53 and if from sympathy the apostle allows a man a second marriage because he cannot control himself and burns with passion 54 he also does not commit any sin according to the 49 gf strom ill 94 where adam's fall consisted in having intercourse before the proper time so gen 4 25 si cf rom 7 2 52 perhaps by a change of text l

after sexual intercourse a man should wash 5 7 p or there is no need for the lord to make be lievers do this after intercourse since by one baptism he has washed them clean for every such occasion as also he has com prehended in one baptism the many washings of moses 83 in ancient times the law directed washing after the emis sion of the generative seed because it was foretelling our regeneration by speaking of fleshly birth not because it held human birth to be a defilement for that which after birth ap pears as a man is effected by the emission of the seed it is not frequent intercourse of the parents which produces birth but the reception of the seed in the womb in the workshop of nature 5s the seed is transformed into an embryo how then can marriage be a state only intended for ancient times and an in vention of the law and marriage on chrisitian principles of a different nature if we hold that the old and the new testa ments proclaim the same god for what god has joined to gether no man may ever put asunder for any good reason if the father commanded this so much the more also will the son keep it if the author of the law and the gospel is the same he never contradicts

is to sin of which the law makes us aware the law indicates it it does not give rise to it by telling us what we ought to do and pro hibiting what we ought not to do the law shows up the sin which

of its birth but also of what is ac quired by learning thus the children also are holy 66 they are well pleasing to god in that the lord's words bring the soul as a bride to god fornication and marriage are therefore dif ferent things as far apart as god is from the devil and you are dead to the law through the body of christ so that you might belong to another to him who was raised from the dead 67 it is to be understood here that you become closely obedient since it is also according to the truth of the law that we obey the same lord whose commands are given to us from a distance 68 85 and no doubt of such people it is reasonable when the spirit says expressly that in the last times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to spirits of error and the teaching in spired by daemons through hypocritical sophists who are seared in conscience and forbid marriage and demand abstinence from foods which god created to be eaten with thanksgiving by believers who know the truth everything created by god is food and none is to be rejected but accepted with thanksgiving or it is sanctified by the word of god and by prayer 69 it necessarily follows then that it is wrong to forbid marriage and indeed eating meat or drinking wine for it is written it is good to eat no meat and to drink no wine 70 if it causes offence to do so and that it is good to remain as i am 71 but both he who eats with thanksgiving and he who does not eat who also offers thanksgiving 72 and has a continent enjoyment should live in accordance with reason 86 in general all the epistles of the apostle teach self control and continence and contain numerous instructions about mar riage begetting children and domestic life but they nowhere rule out self controlled marriage rather they preserve the har mony of the law and the gospel and approve both the man who with thanks to god enters upon marriage with sobriety and the man who in accordance with the lord's will lives as a celibate even as

and he is not ashamed to add to this the quotation from the prophet you all shall wax old like a garment and moth shall eat you 76 but we do not contradict the scripture our bodies are corruptible and by nature subject to continual change 77 perhaps the prophet was foretelling destruction to those whom he was addressing because they were sinners but the saviour did not refer to begetting children but was exhorting those who wished only to possess large wealth and not to help the needy to share their goods with others 87 that is why he says work not for the food which per ishes but for that which abides unto eternal life 78 similarly they quote the saying the children of the age to come neither marry nor are given in marriage 79 but if anyone thinks care fully about this question concerning the resurrection of the dead and those who asked it he will find that the lord is not rejecting marriage but ridding their minds of the expectation that in the resurrection there will be carnal desire the phrase the chil dren of this age is not meant to make a contrast with the children of some other age but is equivalent to saying those who are born in this age who are children because of birth they beget and are begotten since without birth no one will come into this life but this birth which must expect a corres ponding corruption 80 no longer awaits him who has once de parted from this life your father in heaven is one but he is also father of all men by creation therefore call no man your father on earth 81 which is as if he said do not reckon him who begat you by fleshly generation to be the cause of your being but as the one who co operated in causing your birth or rather as a subordinate helper to that end 88 he thus wishes us to turn ourselves again and become as children 82 who have come to know the true father and are re born through water by a generation different from birth in the created world yes he says the unmarried cares for the things 73 the source of the quotation is unknown the entire sentence is cited by clement from the epistle of barnabas 11 9 74 schwartz in his edition of tatian p 49 thinks this is not tatian 75 matt 6 19 76 isa

is married how he can please his wife 83 what then is it not lawful also for those who wish to please their wives according to the will of god to give thanks to god is it not allowable for both the married man and his wife to care for things of the lord together but just as the unmarried woman cares for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and spirit 84 so also the married woman cares in the lord for the things of her husband and the things of the lord the one as a wife the other as a virgin but to put to shame and to discourage those inclined to contract a second marriage the apostle appropriately uses strong language and says at once every other sin is external to the body but he who com mits fornication sins against his own body 85 89 but if anyone dares to call marriage fornication he again falls into blasphemy against the law and the lord for as covetousness is called fornication because it is opposed to con tentment with what one possesses and as idolatry is an abandon ment of the one god to embrace many gods so fornication is apostasy from single marriage to several for as we have re marked the apostle uses the words fornication and adultery in three senses 86 on this matter the prophet says you were sold to your sins and again you were defiled in a foreign land 87 here he regards as defilement an association which is bound up with a strange body and not with that which in marriage is be stowed for the purpose of procreation that is why the apostle also says i wish then that the younger women marry bear children look after their houses and give the adversary no occasion for abuse for some have already turned aside after satan as 90 and indeed he entirely approves of the man who is hus band of one wife whether he be presbyter deacon or layman if he conducts his marriage unblameably 89 for he shall be saved by child bearing 90 again when the saviour calls the jews a wicked and adulterous generation 91 he teaches that they did not know the law as the law intended by following the tradition of the elders and the commandments of men 92 they were com mitting adultery against the law as they did not accept the husband and lord of their virginity 93 but perhaps he also knew that they were enslaved by alien desires on account of 83 i cor 7 32 84 i cor 7 34 s i cor 6 18 se cf strom vii 75 below 87 isa 50 1 baruch 3 10 ss

jews at least no public har lots existed and adultery was forbidden but he who said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come 94 to the divine supper was an example to convict those who for pleasure's sake were abandoning the divine command for if this saying is taken otherwise neither the righteous before the coming of christ nor those who have married since his coming even if they be apostles will be saved and if they again bring forward the point that the prophet also said i have become old among all my enemies 95 by enemies they ought to understand sins it is not marriage that is a sin but fornication since otherwise they must say that birth and the creation of birth are sinful chapter xiii 91 such are the arguments of julius cassianus 96 the originator of docetism at any rate in his book concerning continence and celibacy he says these words and let no one say that because we have these parts that the female body is shaped this way and the male that way the one to receive the other to give seed sexual intercourse is allowed by god for if this arrangement had been made by god to whom we seek to attain he would not have pronounced eunuchs blessed nor would the prophet have said that they are not an unfruitful tree 97 using the tree as an illustration of the man who chooses to emasculate himself of any such notion 92 and striving still further to support his godless opinion he adds could not one rightly find fault with the saviour if he was responsible for our formation and then delivered us from error and from this use of the generative organs in this respect his teaching is the same as tatian's but he departed from the school of valentine on this account he says when salome asked when she would know the answer to her questions the lord said when you trample on the robe of shame and when the two shall be one and the male with the female and there is neither male nor female 95 93 in the first place we have not got the saying in the four gospels that have been handed down to us but in the gospel according to the egyptians secondly cassian seems to me not to know that it refers to wrath in speaking of the male impulse s 4 luke 14 20 95 ps 6 7 96 see introduction p 23 s 7 isa 56 3 c ii clement xii 2 strom 9 iii 45 above 84 clement of alexandria and to desire in speaking of the female when these operate there follow repentance and shame but when a man gives in neither to wrath nor to desire both of which increase in conse quence of evil habit and unbringing so as to cloud and obscure rational thought but puts off from him the darkness they cause with penitence and shame uniting spirit and soul in obedi ence to the word then as paul also says there is among you neither male nor female 1 for the soul leaves this physical form in which male and female are distinguished and being neither the one nor the other changes to unity 2 but this worthy fellow thinks in platonic fashion that the soul is of divine origin and having become female by desire has come down here from above to birth and corruption 3 chapter xiv 94 he then does violence to paul making him hold that birth originated from deceit because he says i am afraid lest as the serpent deceived eve your thoughts should be corrupted from the simplicity which is towards christ 4 but the lord as all agree came to that which was astray 5 but it had not strayed from above into earthly birth for birth is created and the creation of the almighty who would never bring the soul down from what is good to what is bad the saviour came to men who were astray in their thoughts to us whose minds were corrupted as a result of our disobeying the commandments because we were lovers of pleasure and perhaps also because the first man of our race did not bide his time desired the favour of marriage before the proper hour and fell into sin by not waiting for the time of god's will 6 for every one who looks upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her 7 95 it was the same lord who at that time also condemned the desire which preceded marriage when therefore the apostle says put on the new man which is created after god 8 he speaks to us who were formed as we are by the will of the almighty in speaking of the old man and the new he is not re ferring to birth and rebirth respectively but to manner of life the one being disobedient the other obedient the coats of 99 cf plato rep 492 a 495 a i gal 3 28 2 cf strom ill 69 above 3 cf strom ill 13 iv 83 plato phaedo 81 c phaedr 248 g 4 ii cor 1 1 3 5 matt 18 1 1 6 cf strom ill 81 matt 5 28 s

after the necessary preliminary discussion he further says the subjects of earthly kings both beget and are born but our citizenship is in heaven from whence also we look for the saviour 3 10 that this remark also is right we recognize since we ought to behave as strangers and pilgrims if married as though we were not married if possessing wealth as though we did not possess it if procreating children as giving birth to mor tals as those who are ready to abandon their property as men who would even live without a wife if need be as people who are not passionately attached to the created world but use it with all gratitude and with a sense of exaltation beyond it chapter xv 96 and again when the apostle says it is good for a man not to touch a woman but because of the risk of immorality let each man have his own wife he explains it as it were by the further words lest satan tempt you 11 in the phrase because of incontinence 12 he speaks not to those who chastely use mar riage for procreation alone but to those who were desiring to go beyond procreation lest the adversary should raise a stormy blast and arouse desire for alien pleasures but perhaps because satan is zealously hostile to those who live rightly and contends against them and wishes to bring them over to his own side he aims to give them occasions for falling by making it difficult for them to be continent 97 accordingly the apostle rightly says it is better to marry than to burn 13 that the husband may give to the wife her due and the wife to the husband and that they should not deprive one another of help given by divine providence for the purpose of generation but whosoever shall not hate father or mother or wife or children they quote cannot be my disciple 14 this is not a command to hate one's family for he says honour gen 3 21 among the gnostics this interpretation of the coats of skins is common it was also attributed to origen who certainly regarded it as a possible

is this do not let yourself be led astray by irra tional impulses and have nothing to do with the city customs for a household consists of a family and cities of households as paul also says of those who are absorbed in marriage that they aim to please the world 16 again the lord says let not the married person seek a divorce nor the unmarried person mar riage 17 that is he who has confessed his intention of being celibate let him remain unmarried 98 to both the same lord gives the corresponding promises by the prophet isaiah in the following words let not the eunuch say i am dry wood to eunuchs the lord says this if you keep my sabbaths and do all that i command you i will give you a place better than sons and daughters 18 for a eunuch is not justified merely because he is a eunuch and cer tainly not because he observes the sabbath if he does not keep the commandments and for the married he goes on to say my elect shall not labour in vain nor bear children to be accursed for they are a seed blessed by the lord 19 for him who begets children and brings them up and educates them in the lord just as for him who begets children by means of the true teach ing a reward is laid up as also for the elect seed but others hold that procreation is a curse and do not understand that the scripture speaks against them those who are in truth the lord's elect neither teach doctrines nor beget children to be accursed as the sects do 99 a eunuch then does not mean a man who has been cas trated nor even an unmarried man but a man who is un productive of truth formerly he was dry wood but if he obeys the word and observes the sabbaths by abstaining from sins and keeps the commandments he will be in higher honour that those who are educated in word alone and fail to do what is right little children says our teacher a little while longer i am with you 20 that is why paul also instructs the galatians in these words my little children with whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you 21 and again he writes to the corinthians for though you may have ten thousand in structors in christ yet you have not many fathers for in christ i have begotten you through

eunuchs free from all sin for the sake of the kingdom of heaven by their abstinence from the world 24 chapter xvi 100 when jeremiah says cursed be the day in which i was born and let it not be longed for he is not saying simply that birth is accursed but is in despair at the sins and disobedience of the people in fact he goes on why was i born to see labour and pain and my days accomplished in shame 25 all those who preach the truth are persecuted and in danger because of the disobedience of their hearers why did not my mother's womb become my tomb that i might not see the distress of jacob and the toil of the nation of israel says esdras the prophet 26 no one is pure from defilement says job not even if his life last but one day 27 let them tell us how the newly born child could commit fornication or how that which has done nothing has fallen under the curse of adam the only consistent answer for them it seems is to say that birth is an evil not only for the body but also for the soul for the sake of which the body itself exists and when david says in sin i was born and in unrighteousness my mother conceived me 28 he says in prophetic manner that eve is his mother for eve be came the mother of the living 29 but if he was conceived in sin yet he was not himself in sin nor is he himself sin 101 but on the question whether everyone who turns from sin to faith turns from sinful habits to life as though born of a mother i may call as witness one of the twelve prophets who said am i to give my firstborn for my impiety the fruit of my womb for the sin of my soul 30 this is not an attack on him who said increase and multiply 31 rather he calls the first im pulses resulting from birth by which we do not know god im piety if on this basis anyone maintains that birth is evil let him also on the same ground hold that it is good since in it we 23 deut 23 1 24 an allusion to a saying ascribed to jesus not in the canonical gospels c oxyrhyncus logia p oxy i clement eel

not the knowledge of god 32 that is those who sin for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against spiritual powers 5 33 but the rulers of darkness have power to tempt us that is why concessions are made 34 therefore also paul says i buffet my body and bring it into subjection for everyone who wishes to take part in a contest is continent in all things the words he is continent in all things really mean that though he does not abstain from everything yet he is self controlled on such things as he thinks fit they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible 35 if we conquer in the struggle though there is no crown for us if we do not put up any fight at all there are also some now who rank the widow higher than the virgin in the matter of continence on the ground that she scorns pleasure of which she has had experience 36 chapter xvii 102 if birth is something evil let the blasphemers say that the lord who shared in birth was born in evil and that the virgin gave birth to him in evil woe to these wicked fellows they blaspheme against the will of god and the mystery of creation in speaking evil of birth this is the ground upon which docetism is held by cassian and by marcion also and on which even valentine indeed teaches that christ's body was psychic 37 they say man became like the beasts when he came to practise sexual intercourse but it is when a man in his passion really wants to go to bed with a strange woman that in truth such a man has become a wild beast wild horses were they become each man whinnied after his neighbour's wife 38 and if the serpent took the use of intercourse from the irrational animals and persuaded adam to agree to have sexual union with eve as though the couple first created did not have such union by nature as some think this again is blasphemy against the crea tion for it makes human nature weaker than that of the brute beasts if in this matter those who were first created by god copied them 32 i cor 15 34 33

103 but if nature led them like the irrational animals to procreation yet they were impelled to do it more quickly than was proper because they were still young and had been led away by deceit thus god's judgment against them was just because they did not wait for his will but birth is holy by it were made the world the existences the natures the angels powers souls the commandments the law the gospel the knowledge of god and all flesh is grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass withers the flower falls but the word of the lord abides 39 which anoints the soul and unites it with the spirit without the body how could the divine plan for us in the church achieve its end surely the lord him self the head of the church 40 came in the flesh though without form and beauty 41 to teach us to look upon the formless and incorporeal nature of the divine cause for a tree of life says the prophet grows by a good desire 42 teaching that desires which are in the living lord are good and pure 104 furthermore they wish to maintain that the intercourse of man and wife in marriage which is called knowledge 43 is a sin this sin is referred to as eating of the tree of good and evil and the phrase he knew 44 signifies transgression of the com mandment but if this is so even knowledge of the truth is eating of the tree of life 45 it is possible for a sober minded marriage to partake of that tree we have already observed that marriage may be used rightly or wrongly 46 and this is the tree of know ledge if we do not transgress in marriage what then does not the saviour who heals the soul also heal the body of its passions but if the flesh were hostile to the soul he would not have raised an obstacle to the soul by strengthening with good health the hostile flesh this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god nor corruption incorruption 47 for sin being corruption cannot have fellowship with incorrup tion which is

steps for not unjustly are nets spread out to catch birds for they are guilty of bloodshed and treasure up evil for them selves 53 that is they seek for immorality and teach their neighbours to do the same according to the prophet they are fighters struck with their own tails 54 ourai to which the greeks give the name kerkoi those to whom the prophecy refers might well be lustful incontinent men who fight with their tails children of darkness 55 and wrath bloodstained suicides and murderers of their neighbours purify out the old leaven that you may be a new lump 56 cries the apostle to us and again in anger at such people he directs that we should have no fellowship with any one called a brother if he is a fornicator or covetous man or idolater or reviler or drunkard or robber with such a man one ought not even to eat 57 for i through the law am dead to the law he says that i may live unto god i am crucified with christ it is no longer i that live meaning that i used to live according

that a millstone were hung about him and he cast into the sea than that he should pervert one of my elect 61 for the name of god is blasphemed because of them 62 therefore the apostle nobly says i wrote to you in my letter to have no company with fornicators as far as the words but the body is not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body and to show that he does not regard marriage as fornication he goes on do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body with her 63 or who will assert that before she is married a virgin is a harlot and do not deprive one another he says except by agreement for a time indicating by the word deprive the obligation of mar riage procreation which he has set forth in the preceding pas sage where he says let the husband give the wife her due and likewise also the wife to the husband 64 1 08 in fulfilling this obligation she is a helpmeet in the house and in christian faith and the apostle expresses the same point even more clearly as follows to the married i direct yet not i but the lord that the wife be not separated from her husband and if she is separated let her remain unmarried or be recon ciled to her husband and that the husband should not leave his wife but to the rest i say not the lord if any brother down to the words but now are they holy 65 what have they to say to these words these people who disparage the law and speak as if marriage were only conceded by the law and is not also in accord with the new testament what reply to these directions have those who recoil from intercourse and birth for he also lays down that the bishop who is to rule the church must be a man who governs his own household well a household pleasing to the lord consists of a marriage with one wife 66 109 to

miscellanies book vii 1 the text chapter i i it is now time for us to prove to the greeks that the gnostic alone is truly devout so that the philosophers learning what sort of person the true christian is may condemn their own folly for their careless and indiscriminate persecution of the name of christian while they irrationally abuse as atheists those who have the knowledge of the true god and in addressing philosophers i think one should employ ratiocination as more convincing since they are better trained to understand it from their previous course of instruction even if they have not yet shown themselves worthy to participate in the power to believe of the sayings of the prophets 2 we will make no mention at pre sent intending hereafter to avail ourselves of the scriptures on the fitting occasions for the present we will only give a sum mary indication of what is declared by them in the form of a sketch of the christian religion in order that we may not break the thread of the discourse by constant references to the scrip tures especially when addressing those who do not yet under stand their phraseology when we have shown their general purport the exhibition of the testimonies shall be superadded afterwards on their believing and if our words seem to some of the uninstructed to be different from the lord's scriptures let them know that it is from the scriptures that they draw their life and breath and that it is their object taking these as their starting point to set forth not their phraseology but their meaning only for further elaboration being unseasonable would with good reason seem superfluous while on the other hand it would be a very careless and unsatisfactory way of 1 the translation of book vii is that of j b mayor revised 2 i.e the scriptures as a whole so often in clement 93 94 clement of alexandria treating the subject if we were to omit all consideration of that which is of pressing importance and blessed indeed are they who search out the testimonies of the lord with their whole heart they will seek him 3 now they which testify of the lord are the law and the prophets 4 2 it is our business then to prove that the gnostic alone is holy and pious worshipping the true god as befits him and the worship which befits god includes both loving god and being loved by him to the gnostic every kind of pre eminence seems honourable in proportion to its worth in the world of sense rulers and parents and elders generally are to be honoured in matters of teaching the most ancient philosophy and the earliest prophecy in the spiritual world that which is elder in origin the son the beginning and first fruit of all existing things him self timeless and without beginning from whom the gnostic believes that he receives the knowledge of the ultimate cause the father of the universe the earliest and most beneficent of all existences no longer reported byword of mouth but worshipped and adored as is his due with silent worship and holy awe who was manifested indeed by the lord so far as it was possible for the learners to understand but apprehended by those whom the lord has elected for knowledge those says the apostle who have their senses exercised 5 3 the gnostic therefore pays service to god by his constant self discipline and by cherishing that which is divine in himself in the way of unremitting charity for as regards the service of men part may be classed as meliorative treatment and part as ministrative service thus the medicinal art is meliorative of the body and philosophy of the soul but that which parents receive from children and rulers from subjects is ministrative aid similarly in the church the meliorative service is imaged in the presbyters the ministrative in the deacons as both these ser vices are performed by the ministering angels for god in their administration of earthly things so they are also performed by the gnostic himself while on the one hand he serves god and on the other hand sets forth his meliorative philosophy to men in whatsoever way he may be appointed to instruct them with a view to their improvement for he alone is truly devout who ministers to god rightly and unblameably in respect to human affairs for as the best treatment of plants is that whereby the fruits grow and are gathered in by the science and art of hus 3 ps 119 118 i peter 1 10 4 john 5 39 rom 3 21 cf acts 10 43 8 e b 5214 on spiritual perfection 95 bandry supplying to men the benefit derived from the fruits so the best ingathering which the devoutness of the gnostic can accomplish by means of his art is the appropriation of the fruits of all who have come to believe through him as one after an other becomes possessed of knowledge and is thus brought into the way of salvation and if by godliness we understand the habit of mind which preserves the fitting attitude towards god 6 then the godly alone is dear to god and such would be he who knows what is fitting both

is a lover of his father so he who honours god is a lover of god hence too the gnostic faculty seems to me to reveal itself in three achievements i in the knowledge of the facts of the christian religion 2 in the accomplishment of whatever the word enjoins 3 in the capacity to impart to others after a godly manner the hidden things of truth how then can he who is convinced that god is almighty and who has learnt the divine mysteries from his only begotten son how can such an one be an atheist an atheist is one who does not be lieve in the existence of god while we call by the name of super stitious him who fears the demons and who deifies everything down to stocks and stones having brought into slavery the spirit and the inner man which lives in accordance with reason chapter ii 5 the first proof that one knows god after one has put con fidence in the saviour's teaching is that one in no way does wrong in the conviction that this befits the knowledge of god thus the most excellent thing on earth is the most devout of men and the most excellent in heaven is the angel who is nearer in place to the deity and already more purely participant of the eternal and blessed life but most perfect and most holy of all most sovereign most lordly most royal and most beneficent is the nature of the son which approaches most closely to the one almighty being the son is the highest

himself to obtain salvation by the exercise of free choice and by fulfilling all that is required on his part 15 so as to lay hold on the hope 16 this is he who bestows on the greeks also their philosophy through the inferior angels for by an ancient and divine ordinance angels are assigned to the dif ferent nations but to be the lord's portion 17 is the glory of the believers here we have the following alternatives either the lord cares not for all men which might arise from incapacity but this it is forbidden to say for incapacity is a mark of weak ness or from want of will on the part of one possessed with power but such an affection is incompatible with goodness in any case he who for our sake took upon him our flesh with its capacity for suffering is not rendered indifferent to others sor row by self indulgence or he has regard for us all which also beseems him who was made the lord of all for he is the saviour not of one here and another there but to the extent of each

especially when he is carrying out the will of the good and almighty father 20 no as the lord himself is absolutely inaccessible to envy being eternally free from passion so neither is man's state such as to be envied by the lord it is another who envies who is also acquainted with passion 21 nor yet can it be said that the lord from ignorance did not will to save mankind because he knew not how to take care of each for ignorance touches not the son of god who was the father's counsellor 22 before the foundation of the world 23 the wisdom in which the almighty god rejoicepl 24 for the son is the power of god 25 as being the original word of the father prior to all created things and he might justly be styled the wisdom of god 25 and the teacher of those who were made by him neither indeed could he ever abandon his care for mankind through the distraction of any pleasure seeing that after he had taken upon him our flesh which is by nature subject to passion he trained it to a habit of impassibility and how could he be saviour and lord if he were not saviour and lord of all saviour of those who have be lieved because they have determined to know lord of those who have been disobedient until they have been enabled to confess their sins and have received the grace which comes through him in the way adapted and corresponding to their state but all the activity of the lord is referred to the almighty the son being so to speak a certain activity of the father 8 the saviour then could never be a hater of men seeing that it was owing to his abounding love for man that he scorned not the weakness of human flesh but having clothed himself with it has come into the world for the common salvation of men for faith is common to all who choose it no nor could he ever neglect man his peculiar work seeing that into man alone of all animals has an idea of god been instilled at his creation neither could there be any better government of men or one more consonant to the

have received the government of it as his due but the true ruler and director is the word of god and his providence superintending all things and neglecting the charge of none of her household and such would be they who have chosen to attach themselves to the word viz those who are being perfected through faith thus by the will of the al might father 26 the son who is the imperceptible power of primaeval motion 27 is made the cause of all good things for he was not seen in his true nature by those who could not appre hend it owing to the infirmity of the flesh but having taken upon him a body which could be seen and handled he came into the world to reveal what was possible to man in the way of obedience to god's commandments 9 being then the power of the father he easily prevails

the commandments previous to the law given to those who were not yet under law 34 for law is not enacted for a just man 35 ordained that he who chose should obtain eternal life and a blessed reward and on the other hand permitted him who delighted in wickedness to consort with what he chose again they ordained that the soul that at any time improved as regards the knowledge of virtue and increase in righteousness should obtain an improved position in the universe pressing onwards 36 at every step to a passionless state until it comes to a perfect man 37 a pre eminence at once of knowledge and of inheritance these saving revolutions are each severally portioned off ac cording to the order of change by variety of time and place and honour and knowledge and inheritance and service up to the transcendent orbit which is next to the lord occupied in eternal contemplation and that which is lovely has power to draw to 38 the contemplation of itself every one who through love of know ledge has applied himself wholly to contemplation it therefore the commandments given by the lord both the former and the latter all flow from one source for neither did he negligently suffer those who lived before the law to be altogether without law 3 nor on the other hand did he permit those who were ignorant of the barbarian i.e jewish philo sophy to run wild for by giving to the jews commandments and to the greeks philosophy he confined unbelief 40 until the period of his own presence on earth in which every one who be lieved not is without excuse 41 for he leads men by both ways of advance whether greek or barbarian to the perfection which is through faith but if any of the greeks dispenses with the pre liminary guidance of the greek philosophy and hastens straight to the true teaching he even though he be unlearned at once distances all competition having chosen the short cut to per fection viz that of salvation through faith 42 1 2 accordingly he made all things to be helpful for virtue in so far as might be without hindering the freedom of man's choice and showed them to be so in order that he who is indeed the one alone almighty might even to those who can

the lesser things also are managed with a view to the safety and continuance of the superior in accordance with their own characters for instance whatever is possessed of virtue changes to better habitations the cause of the change being that independent choice of know ledge with which the soul was gifted to begin with but those who are more hardened 44 are constrained to repent by neces sary chastisements inflicted either through the agency of the attendant angels or through various preliminary judgments or through the great and final judgment by the goodness of the great judge whose eye is ever upon us chapter iii 13 as to the rest i keep silent 45 giving glory to god only i say that those gnostic souls are so carried away by the magnificence of the vision that they cannot confine themselves within the lines of the constitution by which each holy degree is assigned and in accordance with which the blessed abodes of the gods have been marked out and allotted but being counted as holy among the holy 46 and translated absolutely and entirely to another sphere they keep on always moving to higher and yet higher regions until they no longer greet 47 the divine vision in or by means of mirrors 48 but for loving hearts feast for ever on the uncloying never ending sight radiant in its transparent clearness while throughout the endless ages they taste a never wearying delight and thus continue all alike honoured with an identity of pre eminence this is the apprehensive vision of the pure in heart 49 this therefore is the life work of the perfected gnostic viz to hold communion with god through the great high priest 50 be ing made like the lord as far as may be by means of all his service towards god a service which extends to the salvation of men by his solicitous

the lord 52 of this gnostic assimilation the canons as it appears to me are gentleness kindness and a noble devoutness 14 these virtues i affirm to be an acceptable sacrifice with god 53 as the scripture declares that the unboastful heart joined with a right understanding is a perfect offering to god 54 since every man who is won over for holiness is enlightened into an indissoluble unity for both the gospel and the apostle com mand us to bring ourselves into capitivity 55 and put ourselves to death 56 slaying the old man which is being corrupted accord ing to its lusts 5 7 and raising up the new man 58 from the death of our old perversion laying aside our passions and becoming free from sin this it was which was signified also by the law when it commanded that the sinner should be put to death 59 viz the change from death to life that is the apathy which comes from faith but the expounders of the law not understanding this took the law to be jealous and have thus given a handle to those who without ground endeavour to discredit it it is for this reason that we fitly refrain from making any sacrifice to god who has provided all things for all being him self in need of nothing but we glorify him who was consecrated for us by consecrating ourselves also to ever higher degrees of freedom from want and from passion for god takes pleasure only in our salvation fitly therefore do we abstain from offering sacrifice to him who cannot be swayed by pleasures bearing in mind also that the smoke of the sacrifice reaches those whom it does reach i.e the demons in some low region far beneath the densest clouds i 5 the divine nature then is neither wanting in anything nor is it fond of pleasure or gain or money being of itself full and affording all things to every creature which is in need nor again is the divine nature propitiated by sacrifices or offerings or by glory and honour nor is it allured by such things it shows itself to the virtuous alone who would never

the common course and losing heart at their calamities say that there is no god or that if he exists he is not the overseer of all another class consists of those who are persuaded that the gods of common belief are to be pro pitiated with sacrifices and gifts being accomplices so to speak in men's own wickednesses and who are even unwilling to believe that he alone is the true god who is unchangeably the same in his just beneficence 60 1 6 we are justified therefore in ascribing piety to the gnostic whose care is first for himself and then for his neighbours with a view to our attaining the highest standard of excellence for so the son tries to please a good father by showing himself virtuous and like his father and likewise the subject to please a good ruler since belief and obedience are in our own power but the cause of evils one might find in the weakness of matter and the random impulses of ignorance and the irrational forces to which we fall victims from our incapacity to learn whereas the gnostic gets the better of these wild elements by his learning and bene fits all who are willing to the best of his power in imitation of the divine purpose for men should he ever be placed in author ity he will rule like moses with a view to the salvation of his subjects and will quell what is savage and faithless by showing honour to the best and by punishing the bad punishment that is rightly classed under the head of education for above all things the soul of the just man is an image divine made like to god himself 61 seeing that in it is enshrined and consecrated by means of obedience to his commands the ruler of all mortals and immortals the king and parent of all that is noble who is indeed law and ordinance and eternal word the one saviour both for each individually and for all in common he is in truth the only begotten 62 the express image of the glory 63 of the universal king and almighty father stamping on the mind of the gnostic the

converse with the things which are stable and altogether unchangeable 1 7 being ruler therefore of himself and of all that belongs to him the gnostic makes a genuine approach to truth having a firm hold of divine science for the name science would fitly be given to the knowledge and firm hold 66 of intellectual objects its function in regard to divine things is to investigate what is the first cause and what that through which all things were made and without which nothing has been made 67 what are the things that hold the universe together partly as pervading it and partly as encompassing it some in combination and some apart and what is the position of each of these and the capacity and the service contributed by each and again in things concerning man to investigate what he himself is and what is in accord ance with or is opposed to his nature how it becomes him to act and be acted on and what are his virtues and vices and about things good and evil and the intermediates and all that has to do with manhood and prudence and temperance and the supreme all perfect virtue justice prudence and justice he em ploys for the acquisition of wisdom and manhood not only in enduring misfortunes but also in controlling pleasure and de sire and pain and anger and generally in withstanding all that sways the soul either by force or guile for we must not endure vices and things that are evil but must cast them off and reserve endurance for things that cause fear at any rate even suffering is found to be useful alike in medicine and in education and in punishment and by means of it characters are improved for the benefit of mankind 1 8 forms of manhood are fortitude high spirit mag nanimity generosity magnificence it is owing to this that the gnostic takes no notice either of blame or of ill repute from the world nor is he in subjection to good opinions or flatteries of others in the endurance of labours he shows himself amongst other men as a man indeed being always occupied in some good work at the same time that he is manfully surmounting diffi culties of every kind again he is temperate owing to his abiding good sense 68 combined with tranquillity of soul his

neighbours as well as obedient to the command ments for he who is willingly led on by the commandments may be called god's servant 69 but he who is already pure in heart 70 not because of the commandments but for the sake of knowledge by itself that man is a friend of god for neither are we born virtuous nor is virtue a natural after growth as are some parts of the body for then it would have been no longer voluntary or praiseworthy nor yet is it acquired and perfected as speech is from the intercourse of those who live with us for it is rather vice which originates in this way nor again is know ledge derived from any art connected with the supplies of life or the service of the body nor yet from the ordinary course of instruction for we might be well satisfied if this could but pre pare and sharpen the soul the laws of the state it is true might perhaps be able to restrain evil practices 20 again mere per suasive arguments are too superficial in their nature to establish the truth on scientific grounds but greek philosophy does as it were provide for the soul the preliminary cleansing and training required for the reception of the faith on which foundation the truth builds up the edifice of knowledge here it is we find the true wrestler who in the amphi theatre of this fair universe is crowned for the true victory over all his passions for the president is god almighty and the um pire is the only begotten son of god and the spectators are angels and gods and our great contest of all arms is not waged against flesh and blood but against the spiritual powers

for all and no blame can attach to him but he who is able will choose 72 and he who wills prevails it is on this account also that we have received the gift of reason in order that we may know what we do and the maxim know thyself 73 means in this case to know for what purpose we are made now we are made to be obedient to the commandments if our choice be such as to will salvation this i think is the real adrasteia owing to which we cannot escape from god 74 21 man's work then is submission to god who has made known a manifold salvation by means of commandments and man's acknowledgment thereof is god's good pleasure for the benefactor is the first to begin the kindness and he who accepts it heartily keeping due reckoning and observes the command ments such an one is faithful but he who goes on to return the kindness to the best of his power by means of love rises to the dignity of friend and the one most appropriate return from man is to do those things which are pleasing to god accord ingly the master and saviour accepts as a favour and honour to himself all that is done for the help and improvement of men as being his own creation and in a certain respect an effect akin to its cause just as he accepts the wrongs done to those who have believed upon him regarding such wrongs as instances of in gratitude and dishonour to himself 75 for what other dishonour could affect god wherefore it is impossible for so great a gift to make a return in full corresponding to the benefit received from god as measured by the worth of salvation but as they who injure the cattle put a slight on the owners and those who injure the soldiers put a slight on their captain so it shows dis respect for the lord when injury is done to those who are de voted to him for as the sun not only lights up the heaven and the whole world shining on land and sea alike but also darts his rays through windows and every little cranny into the inner most chambers so the word being shed abroad in all

brutal and savage the greeks milder but subject to passion hence the conceptions which the wicked form about god must naturally be bad and those of the good must be excellent and on this account he

proof with a view to show that those are atheists who liken the divinity to the worst of men for either they make the gods injured by men which would show them to be inferior to man as being capable of receiving injury from him or if this is not so how is it that they are embittered at what is no injury like an old shrew losing her temper as they say artemis was wroth with the aetolians on

the communication of the mysteries on the ground that the godless opinion must be got rid of before they are ready to have the truth communicated to them chapter v 28 surely it cannot be denied that we are following right and truth when we refuse to circumscribe in a given place him who is incomprehensible and to confine in temples made with hands 1 that which contains all things and what work of builders and masons and of mechanic art could be called holy were not they more in the right who held that the air and the circumambient ether or rather the whole world and the universe itself were worthy of the divine dignity it would indeed be ridiculous as the philosophers themselves say that man being but a toy of god 2 should make god and that god should come into being through the play 3 of human art for that which is produced re sembles and is indeed the same as that from which it is pro duced thus what is made of ivory is ivory and what is made of gold is golden and in like manner statues and temples executed by the hands of mechanics being composed of lifeless matter must themselves also be lifeless and material and profane and even though you should carry your art to perfection they still retain something of the mechanical this being so we cannot regard works of art as sacred and divine again among the heathen enshrinement is supposed to be essential to deity 3 but what is it which could be localized in a shrine if there is nothing unlocalized to start with on the assumption that all things are in space and further that which is enshrined has received enshrinement from something else being itself previously unenshrined if then god has received enshrinement from men he was previously unenshrined and therefore non existent for by the hypothesis it is only the non existent which was unenshrined seeing that it is always the non existent which undergoes the process of localization by en shrinement and that which exists could not be localized by that which is non existent nor yet by anything else that exists w cf celsus in origen contra celsum iii 59 i acts 17 24 in this and the following paragraphs clement seems to be following a sceptical argument probably of academic origin if enshrine ment is essential to the pagan god that is evidence that the god does not exist 2 plato laws 803 c 889 c e 3 dedication ceremonies included elaborate magical rites to force the god to inhabit his shrine cf numenius 3 quoted by origen contra celsum v 38 110 clement of alexandria for it is itself also in existence and therefore already localized in common with all other existing things 29 it remains therefore that it must be enshrined by itself but how is a thing to beget itself or how is the self existent to localize itself in a shrine was it formerly unlocalized and did it afterwards localize itself no in that case it could not even have existed since it is the non existent which is unlocalized and how could that which is supposed to have been localized make itself subsequently what it already was or that to which all existing things belong the self existent deity be itself in need of anything again if the deity is in human shape he will need the same things as man needs food and covering and a house and all things belonging to them for beings of like form and like pas sions will require the same kind of life and if the word holy is taken in two senses as applied to god himself and also to the building raised in his honour surely we should be right in giving to the church which was instituted to the honour of god in accordance with sanctified wisdom the name of a holy temple of god that precious temple built by no mechanic art no nor embellished by any common vagabond but made into a shrine by the will of god himself i use the name church now not of the place but of the congregation of saints this is the shrine which is best fitted for the reception of the greatness of the dig nity of god for to him who is all worthy or rather in com parison with whom all else is worthless there is consecrated that creature which is of great worth owing to its pre eminent holi ness and such would be the gnostic who is of great worth and precious in the sight of god lie in whom god is enshrined i.e in whom the knowledge of god is consecrated here too we should find the likeness the divine and sanctified image here in the righteous soul after it has been itself blessed as having been already purified and now performing blessed deeds here we find both that which is enshrined and that which is in pro cess of enshrinement the former in the case of those who are already gnostics the latter in those who are capable of becoming so though they may not yet be worthy to receive the knowledge of god for all that is destined to believe is already faithful in the eye of god and consecrated to honour an image of virtue dedicated to god chapter vi 30 as then god is not circumscribed in place nor made like to the form of any creature so neither is he of like passions nor on spiritual perfection iii lacks he anything after the manner of created tilings so as from hunger to desire sacrifices for food things that are capable of suffering are all mortal and it is useless to offer meat to that which is in no need of sustenance the famous comic poet pherecrates in his deserters wittily represents the gods them selves as finding fault with men for their offerings when you sacrifice to the gods first of all you set apart what is customary for the priests first among you and then shame to say do you not pick the thigh bones clean to the groin and leave the hip joint absolutely bare assigning to us gods nothing but the dogs 3 portion a back bone polished as with a file which you then cover with thick layers of sacrificial meal to save appearances and another comic poet eubulus writes as follows about the sacrifices to the gods themselves you offer nothing but the tail and the thigh as though they were enamoured of these 5 and where he brings on dionysus in his semele he represents him as distinguishing first of all when any sacrifice to me they sacrifice blood and bladder don't mention heart or caul the gall and thigh bones are no food for me 31 and men ander 7 has written of the scrag end of the rump the gall and dry bones which says he they set before the gods while they consume the rest

they are deemed worthy of the same happiness and in worshipping the stove itself when it becomes an altar closely connected with the precious smoke hesiod 8 somewhere says that zeus being outwitted in some division of the flesh of the sacrifice by prometheus chose the white bones of the ox craftily concealed in the glistening lard and from that time the tribes of men on earth burn to the immortals white bones on fragrant altars still they altogether deny that god's partaking of nourishment could be explained by the craving which grows out of want accordingly they must suppose him nourished without appetite like plants or hibernat ing bears at all events they say that these are not impeded in their growth whether it be that they are nourished from the density of the air or even from the exhalation arising from their own body and yet if they hold that the deity is nourished without needing it what is the use of nourishment to one who cf kock com att frag i 151 5 kock com att frag ii

prayer and for sending up most rightly this sacrifice the best and holiest of sacrifices when joined with righteousness 9 venerating 10 him through whom we receive our knowledge and through him glorifying him i.e the father whom we have learnt to know at any rate our altar here on earth is the con gregation of those who are devoted to the prayers having as it were 3 one common voice and one mind as to the kinds of nutrition received through the sense of smell though they may be less unworthy of the deity than those received through the mouth still they witness to respiration 32 what then is the worshippers idea as to the breathing of god is it by means of transpiration as in the demons or by inspiration only as in fishes through the dilatation of their gills or by circumspiration as in insects through the pressure of the membranes on the waist no they would not liken god to any of these if they were in their senses but as for creatures that live by respiration they draw in the air by rhythmic beats corresponding to the counter dilatation of the lungs against the chest then if they assign viscera and arteries and veins and sinews and members to god they will exhibit him as in no respect differing from man the word conspiration is that which is properly used of the church for the church's sacrifice is indeed speech rising like incense from holy souls while every thought of the heart is laid open to god along with the sacrifice they are fond of talking about the purity of the most ancient altar at delos that altar which we are told was the only one approached by pythagoras because it was unpolluted by slaughter and death will they then refuse credence to us when we say that the truly hallowed altar is the righteous soul and the incense which ascends from it the prayer of holiness sacri fices i believe are an invention of mankind to excuse the eating of flesh though even apart from such idolatry it was always possible for one who wished it to partake of flesh the mosaic sacrifices symbolize christian piety for instance the dove and the pigeon offered for sins show that the purging away of the irrational part of the soul is acceptable to god but if any of the righteous refuses to weigh down his soul by the eating of flesh he does this on some reasonable ground not as pythagoras and his school from some dream as to the transmigration of souls 11 9 ps 4 5 10 plato leg 799 a ji similarly origcn contra cdsum viii 30 on spiritual perfection 113 xenocrates in a special treatise on animal food and polemon 12 in his book on life according to nature seem to lay it down clearly that a flesh diet is inexpedient as it has already passed through a process of digestion and been thus assimilated to the souls of irrational creatures 33 on this ground especially the jews abstain from swine's flesh considering that this animal is unclean because it roots up and destroys the fruits more than any other but if it is argued that the animals have been given to men we too agree in this only we say that they are not given entirely nor indeed all for the purpose of eating but only those that do no work where fore the comic poet plato in his play the feasts 13 well says hereafter twere well to kill no beast but swine for they are excellent eating and we get nothing out of them but bristles and mire and squealing 55 hence it was well said by aesop that the reason why pigs make such an outcry when they are being dragged away is because they are conscious that they are good for nothing but to be sacrificed 14 and so cleanthes says that in them the soul takes the place of salt to prevent the flesh from putrefying 15 some then eat it because it is useless and others because it injures the fruits while others again abstain from eating it because of its immoderate salacity for the same reason the law never requires the sacrifice of a goat except with a view to banishing evils since pleasure is the fountainhead of vice further they tell us that the eating of goats flesh conduces to epilepsy and they say that the largest amount of nutriment is supplied from pork for which reason it is of use to those who practise bodily training but owing to the sluggishness produced by eating flesh it is of no use to those who try to encourage the growth of the soul a gnostic might therefore abstain from flesh both for the sake of discipline and to weaken the sexual appetite for as androcydes says wine and fleshly gorging make the body strong but the soul more sluggish 16 such a diet does not tend to precision of thought wherefore also the egyptians in their purifications forbid their priests to eat flesh and they them selves live on fowl as the lightest diet and abstain from fish for various fanciful reasons and especially from the idea that such food makes the flesh flabby 34 besides this the life of beasts and 12 polemon succeeded xenocrates as head of the platonic academy 13 kock com ait fr i 607 i cf aelian var mr 10 5 i 5

their soul being akin to the air but we are told that fishes do not even breathe our air but that air which was infused into water as into the other elements on its first creation which is also a proof of the fact that air pervades all matter it is not then expensive sacrifices that we should offer to god but such sacrifices as are dear to him 17 viz that com posite incense of which the law speaks 18 an incense com pounded of many tongues and voices in the way of prayer or rather which is being wrought into the unity of the faith 19 out of divers nations and dispositions by the divine bounty shown in the covenants and which is brought together in our songs of praise by purity of heart and righteous and upright living grounded in holy actions and righteous prayer for to add the charm of poetry what man is there so unwise and beyond measure credulous as to expect that at the burning of bare bones and gall which even hungry dogs would refuse the gods would all rejoice and accept this as their due meed 35 20 aye and would show their gratitude to the celebrants though they might be pirates or robbers or tyrants the christian teaching is that the fire sanctifies not flesh or sacrifice but sinful souls under standing by fire not the all devouring flame of common life but the discerning flame 21 which pierces through 22 the soul that walks through fire 25 chapter vii 35 further we are bidden to worship and honour the son and word being persuaded that he is both saviour and ruler and to honour the father through him doing this not on special days as some others do but

neither in a definite place or special shrine nor yet on certain feasts and days set apart that the gnostic honours god returning thanks to him for knowledge bestowed and the gift of the heavenly

every place whether he be alone by himself or have with him some who share his belief and if the presence of some good man always moulds for the better one who converses with him owing to the respect and reverence which he inspires with much more reason must he who is al ways in the uninterrupted presence of god by means of his knowledge and his life and his thankful spirit be raised above himself on every occasion both in regard to his actions and his words and his temper such is he who believes that god is every where present and does not suppose him to be shut up in cer tain definite places so as to be tempted to incontinence by the imagination forsooth that he could ever be apart from god whether by day or night accordingly all our life is a festival being persuaded that god is everywhere present on all sides we praise him as we till the ground we sing hymns as we sail the sea we feel his inspiration in all that we do and the gnostic en joys a still closer intimacy with god being at once serious and cheerful in everything serious owing to his thoughts being turned towards heaven and cheerful as he reckons up the blessings with which god has enriched our human life 36 but the pre eminence of knowledge is plainly set forth by the prophet in the words teach me goodness and instruction and knowledge 27 where he presents in an ascending scale the guiding principle of perfection here then we truly have the royal man the holy priest of god a combination which is still retained even at the present time among the most enlightened of the barbarians who employ the priestly caste for govern ment 28 such a one is far from surrendering himself to the mob government which tyrannizes over the theatres and as for the things which are there said and done and seen with a view to the allurements of pleasure he repudiates them even in a dream he repudiates therefore both these spectacular pleasures and the other refinements of luxury such as costly perfumes flatter ing the sense of smell or combinations of meats and the attrac tions of various wines enticing the palate or fragrant wreaths of a variety of flowers which enfeeble the soul through the sense enjoying all things soberly he refers his enjoyment in every case to god as its author whether it be of food or drink or ointment and offers to the giver first fruits of the whole using the speech which he has bestowed to thank him both for the gift and for the use of it but he seldom appears at convivial entertainments 27 ps iig ii8 66 lxx 2 the egyptians plato polit 290 d e il6 clement of alexandria unless the banquet invites his attendance by promise of friendly intercourse with those of like mind for he is persuaded that god knows all things and hears not only the voice but the thought since even in our own case the hearing though set in action by means of the passages of the body causes apprehen sion not by the power of the body but by a certain mental im pression and by the intelligence which distinguishes between significant sounds 37 there is consequently no need for god to be in human shape in order that he may hear nor does he need senses as the stoics held 29 especially hearing and sight dependent on the sensitiveness of the air as though he would otherwise be incap able of apprehension but indeed the instantaneous perception of the angels and the power of conscience touching the soul these recognize all things with the quickness of thought by means of some indescribable faculty apart from sensible hearing even if one should say that it was impossible for the voice rolling in this lower air to reach god still the thoughts of the saints cleave not the air alone 30 but the whole universe as well and the divine power instantly penetrates the whole soul like light again do not our resolves also find their way to god uttering a voice of their own and are not some things also wafted heaven ward by the conscience moreover can we con ceive that he who has known his elect according to his eternal purpose 31 and known before its birth 32 that which was to be as already existing must wait for the sound of a voice is it not true that the light of power shines forth in all directions even to the very bottom of the soul since the candle of power as the scripture says searches the secret chambers 33 god is all ear and all eye 34 if one may make use of these expressions 38 where then there is an unworthy conception of god passing into base and unseemly thoughts and significations it is impossible to preserve any sort of devoutness either in hymns or discourses or even in writings or doctrines for which reason what most men call reverence is indistinguishable from irrever ence owing to their ignorance of the truth now the objects of the appetites and desires and of impulses generally are also the objects of our prayers wherefore no one desires drink in the abstract but to drink nor an inheritance but to inherit and in 29 clement makes a slip he means the epicureans 30 cf ecclesiasticus 32 35 2i 31 rom 8 28 29 9 11 32 susanna 42 33 prov 20 27 34 see above vii 5 on spiritual perfection like manner no one desires knowledge but to know no nor a right constitution but to live under such a constitution we pray therefore for the same things that we request and we request the same things that we desire and praying and longing are on the same footing as regards the possession of good things and the benefits attached to their acquisition accordingly the gnostic makes his prayer and request for the things that are really good i.e those pertaining to the soul and he prays and joins his own efforts as well that he may no longer have his good things attached to him like ornaments but may be himself good 39 hence too prayer is most fitting for those who have a right knowledge of the divinity and that excellence of character which is agreeable to him i.e for those who know what are the things which are truly good and what should be asked for and when and how in each case but it is the height of folly to ask of those who are not gods as if they were gods or to ask what is inexpedient i.e what is evil for oneself under the impression that it is good since then the good god is one 35 we and the angels are right in praying that we may receive from him alone either the bestowal or continuance of good things but we do not ask alike for it is not the same thing to ask that the gift may be continued and to strive to obtain it in the first instance 36 prayer for the avoidance of evil is also a kind of prayer but we must never employ a prayer of this kind for the injury of other men except where the gnostic might adapt his request so as to contrive for those who were hardened their return to righteous ness prayer then to speak somewhat boldly is converse with god even if we address him in a whisper without opening our lips or uttering a sound still we cry to him in our heart for god never ceases to listen to the inward converse of the heart 40 for this reason also we raise the head and lift the hands towards heaven 37 and stand on tiptoe as we join in the closing outburst of prayer following the eager flight of the spirit into the intelligible world and while we thus endeavour to detach the body from the earth by lifting it upwards along with the uttered words we spurn the fetters of the flesh and constrain the soul winged 38 with desire of better things to ascend into the holy place 39 for we are well assured that of his own will the 35 matt 19 17 36 clement seems to mean that the angels only pray for the continued enjoy ment of what is already theirs 37 cf origen de orat xxxi below p 322 ff 38 plato phaedr 246 39 heb 9 25 il8 clement of alexandria gnostic leaves this world behind him just as the jews did egypt showing in the plainest way that he was destined to be as near as possible to god and if there are any who assign fixed hours to prayer 40 such as the third and the sixth and the ninth yet the gnostic at all events prays all his life through striving to be united with god in prayer and in a word to have done with everything that is useless for that higher life as one who has already attained here below the perfection of one who in love is full grown however the triple distribution of the hours and their observance by corresponding prayers is also familiar to those who are acquainted with the blessed triad of the holy mansions 41 41 at this point i am reminded of the opinions which are being secretly propagated by certain heterodox persons belong ing to the heresy of prodicus against the use of prayer 42 in order that they may not pride themselves on this their godless wisdom as though it were something novel let these men learn that they are only following in the steps of the so called cyrenaic school 43 the refutation however of the impious knowledge of these falsely called gnostics 44 i reserve to its proper season in order that the censure which must be somewhat protracted may not steal into my notes at this point and so interrupt the subject we have in hand which is a demonstration that only he who is a gnostic according to the rule of the church is really pious and devout and that he alone has his petitions whether spoken or unspoken 45 granted according to the will of god for as god is able to do every thing that he wills so the gnostic re ceives every thing that he may ask 46 for god knows generally those that are worthy to receive good things and those that are not whence he gives to each what belongs to him for this reason if request were made by unworthy persons he would often refuse to give it but would give unasked provided they were worthy yet the petition is not superfluous even though good things be granted without petition made for instance both thanksgiving and prayer for the conversion of his neighbours are the duty of the gnostic thus the lord also prayed returning 40 cf tertullian qrat 25 ieiun y 10 41 gf above vii

in knowledge 48 in order that god who alone is good alone is saviour may be glorified through his son 49 in those who are being saved through the salvation which is according to knowledge 50 and that the know ledge of him may grow from age to age howbeit the mere faith that one will receive is itself also a kind of prayer stored up in a gnostic spirit 42 but if prayer is thus an occasion for converse with god 51 no occasion for our approach to god must be neglected cer tainly the holiness of the gnostic being bound up with the divine providence through a voluntary acknowledgment on his part shows the beneficence of god in perfection for the holiness of the gnostic is as it were a return back on itself of providence and a responsive feeling of loyalty on the part of the friend of god for neither is the goodness of god involuntary like the warmth of fire but his imparting of good things is voluntary even though he should wait to be asked nor on the other hand will the man who is being saved be saved without his will for he is no lifeless machine but will most assuredly hasten to salvation with eager alacrity it is on this account that the commandments were given to man as to a being who would be spontaneously impelled to whichever he might choose whether of things eligible or ineligible god therefore does not do good of necessity but of his own free will he befriends those who turn to him of their own accord 52 for the providence that comes to us from god is not ministrative 53 as though it pro ceeded from inferiors to superiors but it is from pity of our weakness that the nearer dispensations of providence are set in motion like the care of shepherds for their sheep and that of a king towards his subjects while we ourselves also are submissive to our superiors who govern us in an orderly manner according to the commission with which they were entrusted by god they therefore are ministers and worshippers of the divinity who offer the freest and most royal worship viz that which is rendered by devoutness both of purpose and of knowledge 43 every place then and every time at which we entertain the thought of god is truly hallowed 54 but when he who is at once right minded and thankful makes his request in prayer he 47 john 17 4 john 17 19 23 49 matt 19 17 john 17 1 so john 17 3 51 see above vii 39 cfl origen de orat xxix 15 see above vii 3 54 q1 origen de orat xxxi 4 iso clement of alexandria in a way contributes to the granting of his petition receiving with joy the desired object through the instrumentality of his prayers for when the giver of all good meets with readiness on our part all good things follow at once on the mere conception in the mind certainly prayer is a test of the attitude of the char acter towards what is fitting and if voice and speech are given to us with a view to understanding how can god help hearing the soul and the mind by itself seeing that soul already apprehends soul and mind apprehends mind wherefore god has no need to learn various tongues as human interpreters have but understands at once the minds of all men and what the voice signifies to us that our thought utters to god since even before the creation he knew that it would come into our mind it is permitted to man therefore to speed his prayer even without a voice if he only concentrates all his spiritual energy upon the inner voice of the mind by his undistracted turning to god and since the east symbolizes the day of birth and it is from thence that the light spreads after it has first shone forth out of darkness 55 aye and from thence that the day of the know ledge of the truth dawned like the sun upon those who were ly ing in ignorance 56 therefore our prayers are directed towards the rise of dawn 57 it was for this reason that the most ancient temples looked toward the west in order that they who stood facing the images might be taught to turn eastwards let my prayer ascend up as incense before thee the lifting up my hands be an evening sacrifice 58 is the language of the psalms 44 in the case of the wicked then prayer is most hurtful not only to others but even to themselves at any rate if in answer to prayer they were to receive what they call pieces of good for tune they are injured by receiving them because they know not how to use them for they pray to obtain what they have not got and they ask for apparent not real good the gnostic on the other hand will ask for a continuance of the things he possesses and fitness for what is about to happen and indiffer ence as to what shall be denied but as for the things that are really good i.e those pertaining to the soul his prayer is that they may both be granted to him and may continue thus he does not even desire anything which he has not being contented with his present lot for he is not lacking in the good things that are proper to him being already sufficient to himself through 55 ii cor 4 6 56 matt 4 16 57 origen de orat xxxii below p

the omnipotent will so that he no sooner prays than he receives he is brought close to the almighty power and by his earnest striving after spirituality is united to the spirit through the love that knows no bounds this is the man of lofty mind who by the way of science has acquired the most precious and best of all possessions being on the one hand quick to apply the faculty of contemplation while on the other hand he retains permanently in his soul the power over the objects of contem plation i.e the keen clearness of science this power he strives to the utmost to acquire by gaining the mastery over all that wars against the reason 59 and persisting in uninterrupted con templation while he exercises himself in the discipline which teaches the curbing of pleasures and the right direction of action besides this from his wide experience gathered both from study and from life he has acquired freedom of speech not the power of a mere random fluency but the power of straightforward utterance keeping back nothing that may be spoken in fitting time before a right audience either from favour or fear of influential persons 45 at any rate he who has received a clear conception of the things concerning god from the mystical chorus of the truth itself makes use of the word of exhortation exhibiting the great ness of virtue according to its worth both in itself and in its effects being united as intimately as possible with things intel lectual and spiritual in the way of knowledge along with an inspired exaltation of prayer hence he is always meek and gentle affable easy of access forbearing considerate con scientious in him we have a severity of virtue such as is not only proof against corruption but proof against temptation also he presents a soul altogether unyielding and impregnable whether to the assaults of pleasure or of pain if reason calls him to it he is an unswerving judge in no respect indulging his pas sions but keeping inflexibly to the path in which it is the nature of justice to walk being fully persuaded that all things are ad mirably ordered and that for the souls which have made choice of virtue progress is always in the direction of what is better until they arrive at the absolute goodness being brought close to the great high priest 60 in the vestibule 61 so to speak of the father this is the faithful gnostic who is fully persuaded 59 rom 7 23 60 heb 4 14 cf strom vii 9 and 13 above 61 plato phileb 64 c 122 clement of alexandria that all things in the world are ordered for the best certainly he is well pleased with all that happens 46 he is right therefore in not seeking anything further when he is once supplied with the necessaries being persuaded that god who knows all things supplies whatever is expedient to the good even without their asking for as the artificer i sup pose has each request granted to him in the way of his art qua artificer and the heathen qua heathen so the gnostic has his in the way of knowledge qua gnostic and he that turns to god from among the heathen will ask for faith but he that aspires to knowledge will ask for the perfection of love 62 and when he has now reached the summit the gnostic prays that the power of contemplation may grow and abide with him just as the com mon man prays for a continuance of health aye and he will pray too that he may never fall away from virtue co operating to the best of his power that he may end his life without a fall for he knows that even of the angels some having slipped back to the ground from carelessness have never yet succeeded in extricating themselves completely out of their tendency to duplicity into the former singleness of heart but to him who has been trained here below to the highest point of knowledge and the supreme elevation of a perfect man all incidents of time and space are favourable for he is fixed to one unchanging course of life both by choice and practice owing to his uniform stability of purpose but in those who have still some corners 63 of depressing languor that weighs them down 64 the soaring im pulse of faith also flags in him then who has rendered his virtue indefectible by discipline based upon knowledge habit is changed into nature and in such a one his knowledge becomes an inseparable possession like weight in a stone not involun tarily but of his own free will by the power of reason and know ledge and forethought 47 and since that which has not been lost may be raised to a state of indefectibility by carefulness and consideration the gnostic will hold fast to carefulness with a view to avoid sin and to consideration with a view to the indefectibility of virtue now knowledge seems to be the parent of consideration because it teaches us to discern the things which can help to the perman ence of virtue but it will be granted that the knowledge of god is the most important of all things wherefore in this way also of john 14 17 since in the platonic or stoic view the perfect shape was the sphere any angular corner was imperfect 64 pi ato phaedr 247 on spiritual perfection 123 the indefectibility of virtue is assured and he who knows god is holy and pious we have proved therefore that the gnostic alone is pious he rejoices in his present blessings and delights himself in those that are promised as though they were already present for he has not lost sight of them as if they were still absent because he already knows of what nature they are being therefore convinced by his knowledge that each of the things that shall be really is he virtually possesses each and this is enough for man for sufficient and insufficient are measured by that which is normal in each case at any rate if the gnostic is possessed of wisdom and wisdom is divine he who partakes of what has no defect must himself be without defect for the communication of wisdom is not the resultant of energy on the part of the giver and inertia on the part of the recipient nor is any abstraction or deficiency caused by it at any rate the energy is shown to be undiminished by the very fact of the com munication thus then our gnostic has all good in potentiality though not yet in full tale since he would otherwise have been incapable of change in reference to the inspired progresses and orderings which are still due to him by god's decree 48 god also assists him honouring him with a closer over sight for is it not the case that all things have been created for the sake of good men and for their use and benefit or rather we should say salvation he would not therefore deprive of the rewards of virtue those for whom all things exist for it is plain that he valued highly their good disposition and their holy choice seeing that he breathes into those that have taken on themselves a good profession strength for the completion of their salvation in some cases by simple exhortation but also by actual help in the case of those who have proved themselves worthy of their own efforts for to the gnostic every kind of good comes as an accessory 65 seeing that his chief end is in each case knowledge and action in accordance with knowledge and as the physician provides health for those who co operate with him for health so also god provides eternal salvation for those who co operate with him for knowledge and right action and the moment that we do any one of the things in our power which are enjoined by the commandments the promise also receives its fulfilment i like that story which is told among the greeks of a famous athlete of former days who had trained himself for feats of manhood by a long course of discipline having gone up to the olympian games he turned to the image of pisaean zeus 65 a stoic phrase cicero de finibus iii 32 124 clement of alexandria and uttered these words if i o zeus have now done all that was fitting on my part in preparation for the contest do thou make haste to bestow the victory i deserve for just so does the gnostic when he has thoroughly and conscientiously performed his part with a view to learning and discipline and with a view to doing good and pleasing god find the whole world con tributing to perfect his salvation the things then that are re quired of us are those which are in our own power viz choice and desire and acquisition and use and distribution of the things which concern us according as they are present or absent 49 wherefore also he who holds intercourse with god must have his soul undefiled and absolutely pure having raised him self to a state of perfect goodness if possible but at any rate both making progress towards knowledge and longing for it and be ing entirely withdrawn from the works of wickedness moreover it is fitting that he should offer all his prayers in a good spirit and in concert with good men for it is a dangerous thing to countenance the errors of others the gnostic will therefore share the prayers of ordinary believers in those cases in which it is right for him to share their activity also but all his life is a holy festival for instance his sacrifices consist of prayers and praises and the reading of the scriptures before dining and psalms and hymns during dinner and before going to bed aye and of prayers again during the night by these things he unites himself with the heavenly choir being enlisted in it for ever mindful contemplation in consequence of his uninterrupted thought of heaven while on earth again is he not acquainted with that other sacrifice which consists in the free gift both of instruction and of money among those who are in need cer tainly he is on the other hand he is not wordy in his uttered prayers 66 since he has been also taught by the lord what to ask for accordingly he will pray in every place not however pub licly or for all to see but in every sort of way his prayer ascends whether he is walking or in company or at rest or reading or engaged in good works and though it be only a thought 67 in the secret chamber 68 of the heart while he calls on the father 69 in groanings which cannot be uttered 70 yet the father is nigh at hand 71 even before he has done speaking 72 of the three ends of action the honourable the expedient and the pleasant he s matt 6 7 67 see the quotation in para 73 below and strom vi y 78 8 matt 6 6 i peter 1 17 70 rom 8 26 71 ps 145 18 72 isa 65 24 dan 9 21 on spiritual perfection 125 makes the two former his rule and leaves it to those who follow the common life to be guided in any action by the third motive of pleasure chapter viii 50 he whose life is characterized by piety of this kind has little temptation to lying and swearing for an oath is a definitive compact in which god is called to witness and how could one who has once for all proved himself faithful make himself un faithful so as to stand in need of an oath instead of allowing his life to carry with it the security and definiteness of an oath 73 both in his life and in his intercourse with others he shows the faithfulness of his promise by unfailing steadfastness both of life and speech and if injustice consists in the determination of the doer and speaker and not in the suffering of the aggrieved per son he will refrain both from lying and forswearing himself not with an idea that he is doing injury to god since he knows that god is naturally incapable of receiving injury but also for his neighbour's sake he will refuse to lie or break any agreement seeing that he has learnt to love him 74 even though he may not be a personal friend and still more for his own sake he will re frain both from lying and from perjury seeing that he would never if he could help it be found guilty of wronging himself nay he will not even swear at all preferring simply to use the particle y es in case of affirmation and no 75 in case of denial for to swear is to use an oath or its equivalent with in tent to inspire confidence 51 it is enough for him therefore to add the words i speak the truth either to his assent or denial in order to give confidence to those who are too obtuse to see that his answer may be depended on for as regards those who are without i think his life should be worthy of trust so that they should not even ask for an oath but as regards his own family and those who have a right understanding 76 there should be confidence in his fairness i.e in his unforced desire to do right in any case the gnostic is true to his oath but slow to swear since he rarely comes forward to take an oath and that only as we have stated still to be true to one's oath is a part of the harmony of truth so that the observance of an oath follows the rule for the performance of ordinary duties where then is there any further need for the oath to one who lives according 73 cf isocrates 1 22 74 matt 19 19 75 matt 5 37 76 prov 8 9 126 clement of alexandria to the highest standard of truth he who does not even swear will be far indeed from perjuring himself and he who observes every clause of his contracts would never swear at all seeing that it is actions that decide whether contracts are broken or fulfilled just as the question of falsehood and perjury is decided by speaking and swearing contrary to right but he that lives justly without violating any duty is proved by his actions wherein the judgment of the truth is sifted to be true to his oath the evidence of the tongue is therefore superfluous in his case being then persuaded that god is always present everywhere and be ing ashamed not to tell the truth and knowing that not to speak of perjury even a lie is unworthy of himself he is satisfied with the witness of god and of his own conscience only so while on the one hand he neither lies nor does anything contrary to his agreements on the other hand he neither takes an oath when it is demanded of him nor denies what he has done being resolute to be clear of lying even though he should die under torture chapter ix 52 but the dignity of the gnostic is carried to an even further pitch by him who has undertaken the direction of the teaching of others assuming the management in word and deed of that which is the greatest blessing on earth by virtue of which he becomes a mediator to bring about a close union and fellowship with god and as they that worship earthly things pray to the images as though they heard them confirming their covenants before them so the true majesty of the word is received from the trustworthy teacher in the presence of men the living images of god and the benefit done to them is referred to the lord him self after whose likeness the true man creates and moulds the character of the man under instruction renewing him to salva tion for as the greeks call iron by the name of ares and wine by that of dionysus according to the figure which carries back the effect to the cause so the gnostic who regards good done to his neighbours as his own salvation might well be called a living image of the lord not according to the particular outward form but in so far as he symbolizes his power and resembles him in preaching the gospel 53 whatever then he has in his mind that he has also on his tongue when addressing those who are worthy to hear it from their agreement with him since both his word and his life are in harmony with his thought for he not only thinks what is true on spiritual perfection 127 but he also speaks the truth except it be medicinally on occa sion just as a physician with a view to the safety of his patients will practise deception or use deceptive language to the sick according to the sophists 77 for instance the great apostle cir cumcised timothy 78 though he proclaimed aloud and in writ ing that circumcision made with hands profiteth not 79 but fearing that if he were all at once to withdraw from the law to the circumcision of the heart which is by faith 80 he might drive the hebrew disciples who were still restive to break off from the congregation accommodating himself to the jews he became a jew that he might gain all 8 1 he then who stoops to accommoda tion merely for the salvation of his neighbours i.e for the salvation of those for whose sake he practises accommodation not dissembling under stress of the danger which threatens the righteous from those who are jealous of them such a one can by no means be said to act under compulsion though solely for the good of his neighbours he will do some things which would not be done by him in the first instance were it not for them he offers himself in behalf of the church in behalf of the disciples whom he has himself begotten 82 in the faith for a pat tern to those that are capable of succeeding to the exalted office of a teacher filled with love to god and love to man for con firmation of the truth of his words for the manifestation of his love to the lord he is not enslaved in fear he is patient in toil true in word shrinking from falsehood even in the outward utterance and herein always attaining strict accuracy since a lie in his eyes is no idle word but is active for wickedness as being the expression of a kind of treachery 54 so then it is the gnostic alone that witnesses to the truth 83 in every way both by word and deed for he is altogether right in all things in word and act and even in thought itself such then is a brief account of christian devoutness if now the christian does these things fittingly and in accordance with right reason he is acting piously and justly and if this is so the gnostic alone would be really pious and just and devout the christian therefore is no atheist for this is what we proposed to prove to the philosophers so that nothing bad or mean i.e 77 cf plato rep 382 c 389 b 459 c d origen contra celsum iv 18 19

31 18 37 128 clement of alexandria nothing unjust will ever be done by him in any wise it follows from this that neither is he impious rather it is he alone that is truly pious fitly and piously worshipping after the rule of a true devotion him who is in very deed the all ruling god and almighty king chapter x 55 for the knowledge of insight gnosis is so to speak a kind of perfection of man as man harmonious and consistent with itself and with the divine word being completed both as to the disposition and the manner of life and of speech by the science of divine things for it is by insight that faith is made perfect 84 seeing that the man of faith only becomes perfect in this way now faith is a certain inward good without making search for god it both confesses his existence and glorifies him as existent hence a man must start with this faith and having waxed strong in it by the grace of god must thus attain to insight con cerning him so far as is possible we distinguish however be tween insight and the wisdom which is implanted by teaching for in so far as anything deserves to be called insight so far it is certainly wisdom also but in so far as a thing is wisdom it is not certainly insight for the meaning of the term wisdom is shown only in the use of the spoken word while the foundation of in sight on the other hand lies in having no doubt about god but trusting him implicitly and christ is both the foundation and the superstructure christ through whom are both the begin ning and the end now the extremes i.e the beginning and the end i mean faith and love are not matters of teaching but knowledge gnosis being handed down by tradition according to the grace of god is entrusted as a deposit to those who show themselves worthy of the teaching and from this teaching the worth of love shines forth in ever increasing light for it is said to him that hath shall be added 85 knowledge added to faith and love to knowledge and to love the heavenly inheritance 56 this takes place whenever any one hangs upon the lord by means of faith and knowledge and love and ascends up with him to the presence of the god and guardian of our faith and love who is the ultimate source from which knowledge is im parted to those who are fitted and approved for it because they need further preparation and training both for the hearing of the words spoken and with a view to soberness of life and to their 84 james a st2 85 luke 19 26 on spiritual perfection i2q careful advance to a point beyond the righteousness of the law 86 this knowledge leads us on to that perfect end which knows no end teaching us here the nature of the life we shall hereafter live with gods according to the will of god when we have been delivered from all chastisement and punishment which we have to endure as salutary chastening 87 in consequence of our sins after this deliverance rank and honours are assigned to those who are perfected who have done now with purification and all other ritual though it be holy among the holy until at last when they have been made pure in heart 88 by their closeness to the lord the final restoration attends on their everlasting con templation of god and the name of gods is given to those that shall hereafter be enthroned with the other gods who first had their station assigned to them beneath the saviour 8 8a knowledge therefore is swift to purify and suitable for the welcome change to the higher state 57 hence too it easily transplants a man to that divine and holy state which is akin to the soul and by a light of its own carries him through the mystic stages till it re stores him to the crowning abode of rest having taught the pure in heart to look upon god 89 face to face 90 with under standing and absolute certainty for herein lies the perfection of the gnostic soul that having transcended all purifications and modes of ritual it should be with the lord 91 where he is in immediate subordination to him faith then is a compendious knowledge of the essentials but knowledge is a sure and firm demonstration of the things re ceived through faith being itself built up by the lord's teaching on the foundation of the faith and carrying us on to unshaken conviction and scientific certainty as i mentioned before there seems to me to be a first kind of saving change from heathenism to faith a second from faith to knowledge and this latter as it passes on into love begins at once to establish a mutual friend ship between that which knows and that which is known and perhaps he who has arrived at this stage has already attained equality with the angels 92 at any rate after he has reached the final ascent in the flesh he still continues to advance as is fit and presses on through the holy hebdomad into the father's house to that which is indeed the lord's abode 93 being destined there to be as it were a light standing and abiding for ever absolutely secure from all vicissitude 5 matt 5 20 rom 10 5 7 heb 12 7 88 matt 5 8 88 i.e the angels cf origen contra celsum iii 37 89 matt 5 8 i cor 13 12 91 i thess 4 17 luke 20 36 john 14 2 130 clement of alexandria 58 the first mode of the lord's working gives evidence of the above mentioned reward following on devoutness out of many testimonies i will adduce one thus summarily stated by the prophet david who shall ascend into the hill of the lord or who shall stand in his holy place he that hath clean hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour he shall receive a bless ing from the lord and mercy from god his saviour this is the generation of them that seek the lord that seek the face of the god of jacob 94 the prophet is here briefly describing the gnostic and in passing as it seems he shows that the saviour is god calling him the face of the god of jacob i.e one who preached and taught concerning the father wherefore also the apostle used the phrase impress of the father's glory 95 in reference to the son who taught the truth concerning god and gave this mark that one alone is god and father 96 viz the almighty whom no one knew but the son and he to whom the son shall have revealed him 97 that god is one is also declared by the phrase seeking the face of the god of jacob whom alone being god the father our saviour and god characterizes as good 98 but the generation of them that seek him is the chosen race 99 which seeks with a view to knowledge 59 for this reason also the apostle says i shall profit you nothing unless i speak unto you either in the way of revelation or of knowledge or of prophesying or of teaching 1 and yet some things are done rightly though not on rational grounds even by those who are not gnostics as in the case of courage for some men being by nature full of spirit and having fostered this quality without the use of reason act for the most part by irrational impulse and do the same sort of things as brave men so as at times to exhibit the same height of virtue as for instance to endure tortures calmly but this is neither from the same cause nor even with the same purpose as the gnostic even though they should give up their whole body 2 for as the apostle says they have not the love which proceeds from knowledge all the action then of a man of understanding is of the nature of well doing and all the action of him who is without under standing is ill doing even though he should be maintaining a principle since his courage does not proceed from reason nor does he direct his action for any useful purpose such as has its ps 124 3 6 3 heb 1 13 6 eph 4 6 w matt 11 27 s matt 19 1 7 i peter 2 9 i 1 cor 14 6 2 j on spiritual perfection 131 end in virtue 3 the same thing may be said of the other virtues and therefore by analogy in the case of piety accordingly we shall find the gnostic to be such not in holiness only but in re gard to the rest of his conduct also his professions are in accord ance with his enlightened piety for it is the life of the gnostic which it is our purpose now to describe and not to give a systematic view of his beliefs which we shall afterwards set forth at the fitting season preserving the sequence of thought chapter xi 60 the gnostic then has a true and noble conception of the universe as might be expected from one who has comprehended the divine teaching starting with that admiration 4 for the creation which he brings with him as an evidence of his capacity to receive knowledge he becomes an eager disciple of the lord and the moment he hears of god and providence his admira tion prompts him to believe proceeding from this point he does his best to learn in every way employing every means to obtain the knowledge of those things which he longs for and longing joined with seeking arises as faith increases that is to be made worthy of such high and glorious contemplation thus the gnostic will taste of the will of god for he lends not his ears but his soul to the facts indicated by the spoken words since then what he receives through the words are realities and the facts themselves he naturally brings his soul to his duties under standing the commands do not commit adultery do not kill 5 in a special sense as they are addressed to the gnostic and not as they are apprehended by the rest of the world 61 training himself in scientific contemplation he goes on to contend on the strength of these higher and more universal truths being fully assured that he who according to the prophet teaches man knowledge is the lord 6 the lord using man's mouth as his organ wherefore also he has taken human flesh with good reason therefore he never prefers what is pleasant to what is expedient not even though he should be taken at a disadvantage and vehemently urged by the harlot arts of some fair wanton for neither could joseph be seduced from his firm purpose by his master's wife but when she kept hold of his garment he left it in her hands being thus denuded 3 this is stoic teaching arnim s.v.f iii 511 4 plato tkeaet 155 d 5 ex 20 13 15 matt 5 21 27 s ps 94 10 ii 132 clement of alexandria of sin but clothing himself in modesty for though the eyes of his master i mean the egyptian did not see joseph yet the eyes of the almighty were watching him for we men hear the voice and see the bodily form but the lord searcheth the spirit 7 from which both speech and sight proceed in like manner whether disease or accident befall the gnostic aye or even death the most terrible of all things he continues unchanged in soul knowing that all such things are a necessary result of creation but that even so they are made by the power of god a medicine of salvation 8 benefiting by discipline those who are disposed to rebel against amendment being distributed according to desert by a truly merciful providence 62 the gnostic then uses god's creatures when and so far as it is reasonable in a spirit of thankfulness to the creator and so gains the mastery over his enjoyment of them he never bears a grudge is never angry with anyone even though he should deserve hatred for his conduct for he worships the creator and loves his fellow man pitying him and praying for him on account of his ignorance moreover though he shares in the affections of the body naturally sensitive as it is in which he is imprisoned yet he is not primarily affected by passion at any rate in the accidents which befall him against his will he raises himself from his troubles to his native element and is not car ried away by things which have nothing to do with true self but accommodates himself to the necessities of the case so far as it does not interfere with the welfare of the soul for he does not wish to be faithful only in reputation or indeed in outward seeming but in knowledge and in truth that is to say in con sistent action and effectual speech wherefore he not only praises what is noble but himself strives to be noble passing from the condition of a good and faithful servant 9 to that of a friend 10 by means of love owing to the perfection of the virtuous habit which he acquired in its purity by true instruction and long training 63 as one then who would force his way to the pinnacle of knowledge orderly in character sober in bearing he possesses all the advantages which mark the true gnostic fixing his eyes on noble images on the many patriarchs who have fought their fight before him on a still greater multitude of prophets on angels beyond our power to number on the lord who is over all who taught him and made it possible for him to attain that 7 i sam 16 7 jer 17 10 etc 8 euripides phoen 893 matt 25 23 10 john 15 15 on spiritual perfection 133 crowning life for this reason he loves none of the fair things that the world holds out to him fearing lest they should tie him to the ground but he loves the things which are hoped for or rather are already known but whose possession is hoped for thus he endures his labours and tortures and afflictions not like the brave men whom the philosophers talk of from hope that the present evils will cease and that he will again have a share of pleasures no knowledge has begotten in him a per suasion surer than any hope of the reaping of rewards to come wherefore he despises not only the persecutions but also all the pleasures of this world so we are told that the blessed peter when he beheld his wife on her way to execution 11 rejoiced on account of her call and her homeward journey and addressed her by name with words of exhortation and good cheer bidding her remember the lord 64 such was the marriage of those blessed ones and such their perfect control over their feelings even in the dearest rela tions of life so too the apostle says let him that marrieth be as though he married not 12 requiring that marriage should not be enslaved to passion nor distracted from the love to the lord 13 to which love the wife when departing from this life to the lord was exhorted to cling by him who showed himself a husband indeed was not the faith in the hope after death clearly mani fested by those who even in the very height of persecution could return thanks to god the reason i suppose was the steadfastness of their faith which was accompanied by acts of corresponding faithfulness so in every difficulty the soul of the gnostic proves its strength being in first rate condition and vigour like the body of the athlete for it is well advised in the affairs of men measuring what has to be done by the rule of justice having received its principles from god in the first in stance and having attained to moderation in the pleasures and pains of the body in accordance with the divine likeness thus he rises up against his fears with good courage putting his trust in god accordingly the gnostic soul is just an earthly image of the divine power adorned with perfect virtue built up by the combined action of nature discipline and reason the soul thus beautified becomes a temple of the holy spirit 14 when it has acquired a temper of mind corresponding to the gospel in every relation of life 65 such a one rises up against every fear and all that is 11 that peter's wife was martyred is a story told only by clement 12 i cor 7 29 i cor 7 35 u i cor 6 19 134 clement of alexandria terrible not death alone but poverty and disease and disgrace and whatever is akin to these being invincible by pleasure and master of the irrational appetites for he knows well what ought and what ought not to be done having a thorough under standing of what is really formidable and what is not hence he undertakes with intelligence what reason dictates as right and fitting for him to do distinguishing intelligently things that are really encouraging i.e good things 15 from those which only seem to be so and that which is formidable from that which appears formidable such as death and disease and poverty which pertain rather to seeming than to truth this is the truly good man who stands outside the passions having risen above the whole life of passion by the habit or disposition of the virtuous soul for him all depends upon himself for the attainment of the end for the so called dangers of fortune are not formidable to the good man because they are not really evil but real dangers are foreign to the gnostic christian since as evil they are directly opposed to what is good and it is impossible that opposites can happen simultaneously to the same thing in the same respect and at the same time 16 thus playing irreproach ably whatever part in life god may have assigned to him to act he perceives both what he ought to do and what he ought to endure 66 does cowardice then arise in any other way except through ignorance of what is and what is not to be feared 17 if not the gnostic alone is of good courage because he perceives what is good both in the present and in the future and com bines with this as i said the knowledge of the things which are not really to be feared for being convinced that vice alone is hostile and destructive to those who are on the road to know ledge he wars against it as such being fortified with the armour of the lord for it does not follow that if an action has its rise in folly and the operation or rather co operation of the devil it is to be at once identified with folly or the devil because no operation is prudence for prudence is a habit and no operation is a habit so neither is the action that originates in ignorance to be forthwith styled ignorance it is a bad action caused by ignorance not ignorance pure for not even passions or sins are vices thought they proceed from vice no one therefore who is irrationally brave is a gnostic else we might be told that children are brave when they face dangers from ignorance of is plato laches 198 c i plato fop iv 436 b 17 gf plato prot y 360 c on spiritual perfection 135 the grounds of fear for instance they will even play with fire and we may be told that wild beasts are virtuous when they rush upon the spears being irrationally brave on the same prin ciple they will perhaps tell us that jugglers are brave when they have learnt the trick of tumbling among the swords practising a base art for a miserable pittance but he who is truly brave though the peril arising from popular fury is plain before his eyes awaits with confidence whatever comes herein is he dis tinguished from other so called martyrs in that they provide occasions for themselves by exposing themselves to dangers for whatever reason for we must avoid harsh language but the others taking precautions in accordance with the dictates of reason and then cheerfully offering themselves when god really calls them both make their calling sure 18 from the conscious ness that they have not been guilty of any rash act and give opportunity for testing their manhood by their truly rational courage 67 it is therefore neither through enduring lesser terrors from fear of greater 19 as other people do nor again through apprehension of fault finding from people of their own station and way of thinking that they abide by the confession of their calling no they willingly obey the divine call owing to their love to god not for the sake of the prizes of the contests since they prefer no other aim to the doing of that which is well pleasing to god for those that endure from love of glory or from fear of some severer punishment or with a view to any joys or pleasures after death these are mere children in faith blessed indeed but not having attained to manhood like the gnostic in their love to god for the church too has its crowns both for men and for boys just as the gymnasium has but love is to be chosen for its own sake not for any other reason it may be said therefore that the gnostic's perfection of courage grows with the growth of knowledge out of the discipline of life be cause he has always studied how to control his passions love then by her anointing and training makes her own champion fearless and intrepid and full of trust in the lord just as right eousness wins for him the power of life long truthfulness for in the phrase your yea shall be yea and your nay nay 20 there was given an abstract of righteousness and the same may be said of self control also for a man is not made really self controlled through ambition as in the case of the athlete for the sake of crowns and glory nor again through covetousness is ii peter 1 10 plato phaedo 68 d 20 james 5 12 136 clement of alexandria as some feign pursuing a good end by means of a fatal passion no nor yet through the desire of bodily health nor from boorish insensibility enabling him to abstain from pleasures for which he has no taste 21 certainly those who live a life of toil when they get a taste of pleasure presently break down the rigour of their self restraint in regard to pleasure such too are those who are kept in check only by law and by fear for when they get a chance they evade the law deserting the side of honour but temper ance that is chosen for her own sake being perfected according to knowledge and taking up her abode in the heart gives a man authority and makes him independent so that the gnostic is temperate and passionless proof against pleasures and pains as they say the adamant is against fire 68 the cause of these things is love love surpassing all know ledge in holiness and sovereignty for by it the gnostic owing to his worship of the best and highest the stamp of which is unity is made friend 22 and son 23 at once a perfect man indeed grown to the full measure of stature 24 aye and concord also is defined to be agreement about the same thing and by the same thing 53 we mean unity and friendship is brought about by similarity because fellowship lies in unity the gnostic there fore being naturally disposed to love god who is truly one is himself a truly perfect man and a friend of god being ranked and reckoned as a son these are names expressive of nobility and knowledge and perfection in accordance with that vision of god which is the crowning height attainable by the gnostic soul when it has been perfectly purified being now deemed worthy to behold for ever the almighty face to face 25 for hav ing been made entirely spiritual it departs to its kindred sphere and there in the spiritual church abides in the rest of god chapter xii 69 so much then for these things but the gnostic being such as we have described him in body and soul is found to be fair alike towards all his neighbours whatever their legal position whether servant or foeman or whatever it be for he does not neglect him who according to the divine law stands to him in the relation of brother by the same parents certainly when he is in distress he relieves him by consolations and encourage ments and by making provision for the needs of daily life while 21 cf aristotle eth nic ii 2 2 1004 a 24 22 john 15 15 23 john 1 12 24 eph 4 13 25 i cor 13 12 on spiritual perfection 137 he gives to all who are in need he does not do it to the same ex tent but in accordance with justice and proportionately more over he gives even to one who persecutes and hates him if he stands in need of it caring little for those who insinuate that fear was his motive provided that he was doing it not from fear but only from a wish to help for if a man is liberal and forgiving in dealing with enemies how much more will he be loving to his friends such an one will proceed from this point to an exact understanding as regards the person the amount the time and the manner in which liberality would be best dispensed and who could reasonably be the enemy of a man who affords no possible excuse for enmity perhaps as in speaking of god we say that god is opposed to none and the enemy of none for he is creator of all things and there is no existing thing that he does not love but we call those his enemies who are disobedient and do not walk according to his laws as for instance those who hate his covenant so we might find the same disposition in the case of the gnostic for he himself could never be in any way hostile to any one but they who take the contrary course might be thought hostile to him besides even if our habit of freely shar ing with others is called justice still the habit which makes pro portionate distinction of less or more in cases where distribution should be scientific is a form of highest justice there are indeed cases in which right is done as in abstaining from pleasures from vulgar motives for as among the heathen some practise abstinence from present pleasures both through inability to obtain what they desire 26 and through fear of man while there are others who abstain for the sake of greater pleasures 27 so also in the faith some are continent either on account of the promise or through fear of god 70 still even such continence as this serves as a foundation of knowledge and an introduction to what is better and a move ment towards perfection for the fear of the lord is said to be the beginning of wisdom 28 but he that is perfect beareth all things and endureth all things 29 for love's sake not as pleasing man but god 30 yet praise too attends him by way of natural consequence not for his own benefit but for the imitation and use of those who bestow the praise the word meaning continent is used in another sense also not of him who only conquers his 26 a quotation from theognis aristotle eth nic i 9 1099 a 25 f eth eud y i i 1214 a 6 27

the treasures of understanding from which spring the fruits of virtuous activity thus the gnostic never de parts from his own set habit in any emergency for the scientific possession of good is fixed and unchangeable being the science of things divine and human 31 knowledge therefore never be comes ignorance nor does good change to evil hence with him eating and drinking and marrying are not the main objects of life though they are its necessary conditions i speak of mar riage sanctioned by reason and in accordance with right for being made perfect he has the apostles as his patterns 32 and true manhood is shown not in the choice of a celibate life on the contrary the prize in the contest of men is won by him who has trained himself by the discharge of the duties of husband and father and by the supervision of a household regardless of pleasure and pain by him i say who in the midst of his solicitude for his family shows himself inseparable from the love of god and rises superior to every temptation which assails him through children and wife and servants and possessions on the other hand he who has no family is in most respects untried in any case as he takes thought only for himself he is inferior to one who falls short of him as regards his own salvation but who has the advantage in the conduct of life in as much as he actually preserves a faint image of the true providence 71 in any case it is our duty to provide the most varied training for the soul so as to make it impressible for the recep tion of knowledge do you not see how wax is softened and copper refined that it may receive the stamp impressed upon it further as death is a separation of soul from body so knowledge is as it were a rational death leading off the soul from its pas sions and separating it from them and leading it on to the life of virtuous activity in order that it may then say with boldness to god i live as thou wouldst have me for he who makes it his aim to please men 33 cannot please god 34 since the mass of men choose not the things that are expedient but the things that are pleasant but if one pleases god he becomes incident ally well pleasing to good men how then could such an one any longer take delight in eating and drinking and sexual pleasure when he is suspicious even of discourse that is productive of pleasure and of any mental excitement and exercise of will that causes delight for no man can serve two masters god and 3i stoic definition of wisdom cf ill 52 53 33 gal i:ia rom 8 8 on spiritual perfection 139 mammon 35 this he says not meaning money simply but the provision that money supplies for the various kinds of pleasure for indeed it is impossible for him who has a high and true knowledge of god to be a slave to the pleasures that are contrary to him 72 there is then one alone who is free from desire to begin with viz the lord who is the lover of men who for our sakes became man but all that are eager to be assimilated to the stamp given by him strive to become free from desire by train ing for he who has felt desire and has gained the mastery over himself like the widow also becomes virgin again through chastity this is the reward of knowledge 36 to the saviour and teacher which he himself asked for his own viz abstinence from all evil and activity in well doing by which means salva tion is procured as then they that have learnt the arts get their livelihood by the training they underwent so the gnostic gets spiritual life by his knowledge and is saved for he who re fuses to eradicate the passion of his soul causes his own death but ignorance as it seems is the starvation of the soul and know ledge its sustenance and the gnostic souls are those which the gospel likened to the sanctified virgins who wait for their lord 37 for they are virgins as having abstained from evil and awaiting their lord through love and they are wise souls since they kindle their own fight to see the real facts saying we long to receive thee o lord at last we have lived according to thy commandments we have transgressed none of thy precepts wherefore also we claim thy promises and we pray for what is expedient for us feeling that it is unfitting for us to ask of thee the highest rewards even though they may seem to be evil we will receive as expedient all the trials that meet us whatever they may be which thy ordering employs for our training in steadfastness 73 the gnostic indeed has risen to such a pitch of holiness that he is ready rather to pray and fail than to succeed without prayer for all his life is prayer and communion with god and if he is free from sins he will assuredly receive what he desires for god says to the righteous ask and i will give to thee think and i will do it 5 38 if then what he asks is expedient he will receive it at once but things inexpedient he will never ask 35 luke 16 13 36 john 4 36 i cor 9 18 cf isa 53 11 john 17 3 15 17 37 matt 25 1 ff 38 the same quotation occurs in strom vi 78 101 cf vii 49 140 clement of alexandria for and therefore will never receive so he will always have what he desires and if we should be told that sinners sometimes suc ceed in their prayers on the one hand this occurs but rarely because god's goodness is always just and on the other hand it is to those who are able to benefit others that this favour is shown hence the gift is not bestowed for the sake of the petitioner but the divine ordering has a foresight of the person who will be saved by his means and thus reasserts the character of justice in the benefit imparted but to such as are worthy the things that are truly good are granted even without the asking when then a man is righteous not from compulsion or fear or hope but of choice this is called the king's high way 39 traversed by the king's seed but the others are all by ways slippery and precipitous at any rate if the motives of fear and honour were removed i know not whether our brave outspoken philosophers would still be able to hold out against their troubles 74 now lusts and other sins have been called briars and thorns 40 the gnostic therefore toils in the lord's vineyard 41 planting 42 pruning watering being indeed a divine husband man for those who have been planted in the faith they then who have not done evil expect to receive a reward for doing nothing but he who has done good from choice alone claims the reward as a good labourer doubtless he will receive also a double reward partly for what he has not done and partly in return for his good actions such a gnostic is tempted by none except it be through divine permission and that for the benefit of his associates at any rate they are encouraged to believe being cheered by his manly endurance doubtless it was for this cause also that the blessed apostles were brought to give proof and witness of perfection with a view to establishing and confirming the churches since the gnostic then has ringing in his ears the voice which says do thou show pity to him whom i shall smite 43 he prays for the repentance even of those that hate him for the punishment of criminals which is carried out in the amphitheatre is a spectacle unsuited even for children as for the gnostic it is impossible that he should be instructed or delighted with such shows since he has trained himself of set purpose to be noble and good and has thus become insensible to pleasure as he never falls under the power of sins he is not corrected by examples of other men's evils much less can he be 39 num 20 17 4 jer 4 3 matt 13 7 heb 6 8

though they be of worldly blessings not everyone 35 therefore that saith lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of god but he that doeth the will of god 44 and such would be the gnostic labourer who has the mastery over his worldly desires even while he is still in the flesh and is so fully persuaded with regard to the unseen future which he knows that he holds it to be more immediately present than the things which are actually before him 75 this is the capable labourer who rejoices in his know ledge but humbles himself for his entanglements in the neces sities of life being not yet held worthy of the active participation in those things which he knows thus he uses this life as some thing foreign to him merely as an unavoidable necessity he understands too the hidden meanings of the fasting of these days i mean of wednesday and friday 46 for the one is dedi cated to hermes the other to aphrodite at any rate he makes his life a fast both from love of money and love of pleasure which are the springs of all the vices for i have often ere now pointed out 47 that according to the apostle the generic varieties of fornication are three viz love of pleasure love of money and idolatry 76 accordingly he fasts both from evil deeds according to the law and from wicked thoughts according to the perfection of the gospel he is also subjected to trials not for his own puri fication but as we said 48 for the benefit of his neighbours if after experience of labours and troubles he is seen to despise and disregard them the same is to be said about pleasure the great thing is to abstain from pleasure after having had experi ence of it for what credit is it to practise self control where pleasure is unknown the gnostic carries out the evangelical command and makes that the lord's day on which he puts away an evil thought and assumes one suited for the gnostic doing honour to the lord's resurrection in himself moreover when he gets hold of a scientific principle he believes that he sees the lord while he directs his eyes to the unseen and if he fancies that he sees what he is unwilling to see he chides the faculty of vision whenever he is conscious of a feeling of pleasure at the visual impression since he desires to see and hear nothing but what beseems him for instance while contemplating the souls of his brethren he sees also the beauty of the flesh with the 44 matt 7 21 45 tit 2 12 46 cf didache 8 1 47 strom ill 89 1 vi 147 1 eph 5 5 48 c above para 74 142 clement of alexandria soul itself which has been trained to look on beauty alone apart from fleshly pleasure 77 and brethren indeed they are according to the elect creation and the similarity of disposition and the character of their actions where thought and word and deed manifest that same holiness and beauty which the lord willed them as elect to have in mind for faith is shown in the choice of the same things and knowledge in having learnt the same and keeping them in mind and hope in desiring the same and if owing to the necessities of life some slight portion of his care is occupied about food he thinks he is defrauded by such distraction thus he never sees even a dream which is unsuited to an elect soul for verily a stranger and pilgrim 49 all his life through is every one who dwelling in a city despises the things that others ad mire in it and lives in it as though it were in a desert that he may not be constrained by locality but that his own free will may show him to be just to sum up such a gnostic fills the vacant place of the apostles by his upright life his exact judg ment his assistance of the deserving by removing mountains 50 from the hearts of his neighbours and casting down the in equalities of their souls though indeed each one of us is his own vineyard and his own labourer he however even in his best actions desires to escape the eyes of men as long as he persuades the lord and himself that he lives according to the command ments preferring those things on which he believes that his life depends for where a man's heart is says one there is his treasure also 51 through the perfection of his love he im poverishes himself that he may never overlook a brother in affliction especially if he knows that he could himself bear want better than his brother 78 at any rate he esteems the other's grief as his own pain and if he suffers any inconvenience through his kindness in mak ing provision out of his own deficiency he is not vexed at this but only increases his bounty still further for he has a faith un mixed with doubt faith concerning the realities while he com mends the gospel both in his actions and in his thoughts and verily the praise he reaps is not from men but from god 52 as he fulfils the lord's instructions being attracted by the eternal hope he tastes not the fair things of this world but disdains all that belongs to this life he pities those who undergo discipline after death and are brought to

commandments of the lord but is made so to speak a partner of the divine will by actual know ledge he is a true intimate of the lord and of his com mandments elect as righteous fitted as gnostic for rule and sovereignty despising all the gold that is upon the earth and under the earth and the sovereignty which extends from one end of the ocean to the other so as to hold fast to the one service of god wherefore also both in eating and drinking and in marrying if reason so dictates and even in his dreams his actions and his thoughts are holy so that he is always purified for prayer he prays also with angels as being already equal to angels 54 and never passes out of the holy keeping even if he prays alone he has the chorus of saints banded with him such a man is aware of a twofold energy the one that of him who be lieves the other the deserved pre eminence of him who knows since righteousness also is twofold the one caused by love the other by fear 79 certainly we are told that the fear of the lord is pure enduring for ever 55 for they who turn to faith and righteous ness from fear endure for ever for instance fear brings about abstinence from evil while love prompts us to do good building us up to a willing mind in order that one may hear from the lord the words no longer do i call you servants but friends 56 and may thenceforward join with confidence in the prayers and the form of his prayer is thanksgiving for what is past and what is present and what is future as being already present through his faith and this is preceded by the acquisition of knowledge moreover he prays that he may so live his appointed time in the flesh as a gnostic and as one free from the flesh and that he may obtain the best things and escape the worse aye and he prays for us that we may be comforted about our sins and may be converted to knowledge no sooner does he hear the the master's call to depart than he follows it nay owing to his good conscience even leads the way so to speak hastening to offer his sacrifice of thanksgiving and being joined with christ there to make himself worthy from his purity to receive by in ward union the power of god which is supplied through christ for he does not desire to be warm through borrowed warmth or 53 heb 11 13 54 luke 20 36 55 ps i9 g se john 15 15 144 clement of alexandria luminous through borrowed fire but to be altogether light him self such an one knows accurately the word that is spoken un less ye hate your father and mother aye and your own life also and unless ye bear the sign 57 for he both hates the lusts of the flesh with their potent spell of pleasure and disdains all that belongs to handicraft and the support of the flesh nay he rises up against the corporeal soul putting a bit in the mouth of the irrational spirit when it breaks loose because the flesh lusteth against the spirit 58 but to bear the sign 59 is to carry about death 60 whilst still alive having renounced all 61 since higher love is due to him who created the soul for knowledge than to him who begot the body 80 when he has once formed the habit of doing good the gnostic loses no time in benefiting others also praying that he may be reckoned as sharing in the sins of his brethren 62 with a view to the repentance and conversion of his kinsfolk and eager to impart his own good things to those whom he holds dearest and his friends for their part feel the same for him thus he helps the growth of the seeds deposited with him according to the husbandry enjoined by the lord and continues without sin and acquires self control and lives in the spirit with those who are like him in the choirs of the saints even though he be still detained on earth throughout the day and night he is filled with joy uttering and doing the precepts of the lord not only at dawn on rising and at midday but also when walking and lying down dressing and undressing and he teaches his son 63 if his child be of that sex never losing hold of the commandment and the hope giving thanks always to god like the creatures which give glory to god in isaiah's allegory 64 patient under every trial he says the lord gave the lord hath taken away 65 for such also was job he who despising the loss of his outward prosperity surrendered everything else along with his bodily soundness owing to his love to the lord for it says he was upright and holy and eschewed all evil 66 but the word holy implies that his whole management of life was just in things pertaining to god and his knowledge of these things made him a gnostic for neither if good things come should a man be engrossed by them seeing they are merely human nor again should he quarrel with them if evil but should be superior to both treading the one under his feet and passing 57 luke 14 26 27 58 gal 5 17 59

guarded in accommodating himself to others lest accommoda tion should imperceptibly change into inclination chapter xiii 81 he never remembers those who have sinned against him but forgives them wherefore also he has a right to pray for give us for we forgive 67 for this too is one of the things which god desires that we should covet nothing and hate none 8 for all mankind are the work of one will and perhaps our saviour in desiring that the gnostic should be perfect as the father in heaven 69 that is as himself our saviour who says come ye children and i will teach you the fear of the lord 70 desires that the gnostic should no longer need the help given through the angels 7 but being made worthy should receive it from him self and have his protection from himself by means of his obedience the prayer of such an one is the claiming of a promise from the lord and in the case of his brethren who are in need the gnostic will not ask a superfluity of wealth for him self to distribute but will pray that there may be to them a supply of what they need for so he not only gives his prayer to the needy but he provides that which comes through prayer in a secret and unostentatious manner poverty indeed and disease and such like trials are often used for admonition with a view to produce both amendment of the past and care for the future in virtue of the prerogative of knowledge such an one becomes an instrument of the divine goodness by asking for relief for the sufferers and himself does the kind action not from vain glory but simply because he is a gnostic 82 we are told in the traditions that the apostle matthias 72 was wont to say on occasion if the neighbour of an elect per son sins it is the fault of the elect for if he had conducted him self as reason dictates his neighbour's reverence for such a life would have prevented him from sinning what shall we say then about the gnostic himself know ye not says the apostle that ye are the temple of god 73 the gnostic therefore is al ready holy and divine carrying god within him and being car ried by god certainly the scripture represents sin as something 67 matt 6 12 cf basilides in

small like the individual who keeps safe the seed of abraham 76 he then who has god enthroned within him will not desire anything else at any rate leaving behind all hin drances and scorning all the distractions of matter he cleaves the heaven by his wisdom and having passed through the spiritual entities and every rule and authority 77 he lays hold of the throne on high speeding to that alone which alone he knows so blending the serpent with the dove 78 he lives per fectly and with a good conscience faith being mixed with hope as regards the expectation of that which is to come for he feels that he has been made worthy to obtain the gift which he re ceived and that he has been translated from servitude to son ship 79 in accordance with his understanding being on the one hand not without a knowledge of god or rather being known by him 80 and on the other hand showing in the end the effects thereof in a manner worthy of the grace received for works follow knowledge as the shadow the body 83 being then fully assured that it will be better for him after his decease he has good reason for not being troubled at anything that happens nor is he suspicious of any of those things which come to pass for good according to the divine order and since his conscience is void of offence he does not shrink from appearing before the unseen powers after his death having been purged so to speak from every stain of the soul hence he never prefers the pleasant or the expedient to the divine order but trains himself by means of the commandments that he may be both well pleasing to the lord in all things and praiseworthy as regards the world since all things rest upon the one almighty god it was to his own we read the son of god came and his own received him not 81 wherefore also in his use of the things of the world he is not only full of thankfulness and of admiration for the creation but he also receives praise him self for using it as he ought since it is through intelligent action in obedience to the commands that the gnostic arrives at the goal of contemplation from this point he advances ever gather ing from science new food for contemplation and

thus much be said in the briefest possible terms about the gnostic to the greeks as seed for further thought though the simple believer may succeed in one or other of the points mentioned yet it must be remembered that he cannot do so in all nor with perfect science like the gnostic and further of our gnostic's apathy if i may use the term according to which the perfecting of the believer advances through love till it arrives at the perfect man at the measure of the stature 84 being made like to god and having become truly equal to the angels 85 of this apathy many other evidences from scripture occur to me which i might adduce but i think it better to defer so ambitious an attempt owing to the length of the discussion leaving the task to those who are willing to take pains in elaborating the doc trines by extracts from scripture one scripture however i will briefly refer to so as not to leave the topic altogether unnoticed the divine apostle says in his earlier epistle to the corinthians dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints know ye not that the saints shall judge the world etc 5 86 as the paragraph is very long i will set forth the meaning of the apostle's utterance by making use of such of the apostolic expressions as are most to the point giving in the most concise language a rapid para phrase of the passage where he describes the perfection of the gnostic for he not only defines the gnostic's position as con sisting in submitting to wrong rather than in inflicting wrong on another but he also teaches him to forget injuries not even allowing him to pray against him who has done the wrong for he knows that the lord also gave a plain command that we should pray for our enemies 87 the assertion then that the in jured party goes to law before the unjust 88 shows nothing else than a desire to retaliate and a willingness to commit a second s heb 11 5 83 ps 48 12 84 eph 4 13 luke 20 36 8 s i cor 6 1 2 matt 5 44 88 i cor 6 6 148 clement of alexandria wrong that is to be himself equally in fault but the statement that some wish to go to law before the saints indicates those who ask in prayer that their oppressors may be requited for their extortion it shows too that though the latter are better than the former still they are not yet free from passion unless they en tirely forget their wrongs and pray even for their enemies according to the teaching of the lord 85 it is well then that they should also come to a better mind by repentance to faith for if the truth seems to have enemies in those who provoke her to jealousy 89 still she is in no wise hostile to any herself for as god causes his sun to shine upon the just and the unjust 90 aye and sent the lord himself to just and unjust so he who strives to be made like to god through the absence of all malice forgives seventy times seven times 91 i.e as one might say throughout his whole life and the entire cosmical revolution signified by the reckoning of sevens and shows kindness to every one even though some con tinue to ill treat the gnostic all the time of their life here in the flesh for it is not only the judgment of those who have wronged him that the apostle requires the virtuous man to leave to others he even desires that the just man should ask from those judges the forgiveness of their sins for those who have offended against him and with good reason seeing that they who attempt injustice damage only what is external and concerned with the body even though it should go to the extent of death but none of such things properly belongs to the gnostic and how could one judge the apostate angels 92 if he is himself an apostate from the gospel rule that we are to forget injuries why do ye not rather take wrong he continues why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded nay ye do wrong namely by praying against those who offend in ignorance and so far as in you lies ye defraud of the goodness and kindness of god those against whom ye pray and that your brethren 93 refer ring hereby not only to those who are brethren by faith but to those also who are strangers among you 86 for we know not yet whether even he who is at present hostile may not hereafter believe from which we clearly gather if not that all are brethren yet that to us they should seem such and further that all men are the work of one god invested with one likeness upon one nature though in some the likeness may be more con fused than in others the recognition of this is reserved for the 89 deut 32 21 i cor

gospel after the schooling of the law 95 and such were some of you such manifestly as those still are whom you refuse to pardon but ye washed yourselves 96 not simply like the rest but with knowledge you cast off the passions of the soul so as to become assimilated to the goodness of the divine providence to the best of your power both by long suffering and by forgiveness causing the gentleness of your word and deeds to shine like the sun upon just and unjust 97 alike the gnostic will attain this result either by his own greatness of mind or by imitation of one who is better than himself and there is a third cause denoted by the word forgive and it shall be forgiven you 98 where the command seems to compel to salva tion through its exceeding goodness but ye were sanctified 99 for he who has attained such a habit as this must necessarily be holy never falling into any passion in any way but being as it were already freed from the flesh and having reached a holiness above this world 87 wherefore he says ye were justified by the name of the lord 99 ye were so to speak made by him to be just as he is just and ye were intimately joined with the holy spirit so far as it is possible for man for does he not say all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any 1 so as to do or think or speak anything contrary to the gospel and meats are for the belly and the belly for meats but the lord shall destroy them 2 that is all who so reason and live as if they were born for eating instead of eating to live as a subordinate aim but devoting themselves to knowledge as their principal aim and perhaps he means that these are as it were the fleshy parts of the holy body the lord's church being figuratively described as a body 3 viz that spiritual and holy choir of whom those who are only called by the name and do not live accordingly constitute the flesh but this spiritual body i.e the holy church is not for fornication nor must it be con nected in any

sample for those that have ears for we must not divulge the mystery but only indicate it so far as to recall it to those who have been partakers in knowledge who will also understand what is the meaning of the lord's saying be ye perfect as your father is perfect 8 perfectly forgiving sins and forgetting injuries and being habitually free from pas sion for as we speak of a perfect physician and a perfect philo sopher so i suppose we may speak of a perfect gnostic but none of these perfections to whatever height it may attain is regarded as coming into comparison with god for we do not agree with the impious opinion of the stoics as to the identity of human and divine virtue 9 perhaps then we ought to be as perfect as the father wishes us to be for it is impracticable and impossible that any one should be as perfect as god is but our father wishes that we should arrive at an unimpeachable per fection by living according to the obedience of the gospel if then since the saying is incomplete we supply what is wanting for the completion of the passage the explanation of which has been left to those who are capable of understanding we shall both recognize the will of god and shall live a life of piety and aspiration in a manner worthy of the commandment chapter xv 89 the next thing is to reply to the charges brought against us by greeks and jews and since the different schools in other departments of learning take their part in some of the difficulties raised similarly to the above mentioned it may be well to begin by clearing away obstacles and then to proceed to the next i cor 6 18 i cor 6 16 s i cor 6 16 john 14 2 8 matt 5 48 cf origen contra celsum iv 29 vi 48 on spiritual perfection 15 miscellany fully prepared for the solution of the difficulties the first charge they allege is this very point that the diversity of sects shows belief to be wrong for the voice of truth is drowned amid the din of conflicting assertions to whom we reply that both among you jews and among the most approved of the greek philosophers there have been multitudes of sects yet of course you do not say that one should hesitate to be a philo sopher or a follower of the jews on account of the internal dis cord of your sects 10 in the next place it was prophesied by the lord that the seed of heresy would be sown upon the truth like tares upon wheat 11 and what was prophesied cannot but come to pass the cause of this being that the beautiful is always shadowed by its caricature 12 90 what then if some one is guilty of breaking his engage ments 12 1 and neglecting his agreement with us shall we let go the truth ourselves on account of him who has been false to his agreement no the good man must be true to his word and not belie any promise however much others may break their en gagements and just so we ought in no way to transgress the rule of the church above all the confession which deals with the essential articles of the faith is observed by us but dis regarded by the heretics those then are to be believed who hold firmly to the truth using this defence broadly we are now entitled to reply to them that physicians also though holding different opinions in accordance with their particular schools are still equally engaged in the practice of healing does then any one who is suffering in body and needs medical treatment refuse to call in a physician owing to the diversity of medical schools so neither should he who is diseased in soul and full of idols plead the heresies as his excuse in regard to the recovery of health and conversion to god aye and we are told that heresies are for the sake of those who are approved 13 and by approved is meant either those who are coming to the faith if they show unusual discrimination in approaching the teaching of the lord like the approved money changers 14 who dis tinguish the spurious from the legal coin by the false stamp or 10 cf origen contra celsum iii 12 11 matt 13 25 12

cited by early christian writers cf resch agrapha 116 127 152 clement of alexandria those who are in the faith itself and have already approved themselves therein both by their life and their knowledge 91 it is for this reason therefore that we need more attention and consideration to determine how we should live with strict ness and what is true piety for it is evident that the trouble and difficulty of ascertaining the truth have given rise to ques tionings from whence spring vain and self willed heresies when man have not learnt or really received knowledge but have merely got a conceit of it we must therefore spend more thought in searching for the very truth which alone has for its subject the very god and sweet are the discovery and the re membrance which attend on toil the effect of the heresies should therefore be to make one buckle to the toil of discovery and not to abandon it altogether so too if we have set before us on the one hand ripe natural fruit and on the other fruit of wax made to resemble it as closely as possible we ought not to abstain from both on account of their similarity but to dis tinguish the real from the apparent both intuitively and by strict process of reasoning and just as if there were only one royal road but many by roads some leading to a precipice some to a rushing torrent or deep sea a man would not hesitate to travel because of this diversity but would make use of the king's safe highway so we must not give up our search because there are different views as to the truth but must hunt all the more earnestly for the most exact knowledge concerning it for even among the herbs of the garden weeds spring up but the husbandmen do not therefore desist from gardening since then nature supplies us with many helps for testing the things we are told we ought also to discover the harmony of the truth hence we are rightly condemned if we withhold our assent to the things which we ought to believe because we fail to distinguish what is incongruous and unseemly and unnatural and false from what is true and consistent and seemly and natural and these helps we should make full use of in order to gain a knowledge of the real truth 92 this is therefore an idle excuse on the part of the greeks for those who desire it will be able also to discover the truth while those who put forward irrational grounds have no excuse for their judgment 15 for what is their view of demonstration do they deny that there is such a thing or do they admit it i suppose all would admit it except those who deny the evidence of the senses but if there is such a thing as demonstration they 15 rom 2 1 on spiritual perfection 153 must descend to investigation and be taught demonstratively from the scriptures themselves how the heretical schools went astray and how it is only in the true and the ancient church that there is the most exact knowledge and the really best school of thought but of those who turn aside from the truth some try to deceive themselves only others to deceive their neighbours as well they then who are termed wise in their own conceit those i mean who think they have discovered the truth without any true demonstration these men deceive themselves thinking to have attained rest and of such persons there is no small num ber men that avoid inquiry for fear of being refuted and also flee from instruction because it condemns themselves but those who try to impose on their followers are utterly unscrupulous who being well aware that they are absolutely without know ledge nevertheless darken the truth with plausible sophisms but in my opinion the nature of such sophisms is entirely distinct from that of true arguments further we know that it is neces sary to give the terminology of the heresies in order that the truth may be clearly distinguished from them for the sophists steal certain fragments of the truth for the injury of mankind and bury them in the human systems they have themselves de vised and then glory in presiding over what is rather a school than a church chapter xvi 93 but they who are willing to work for the noblest prizes will not relinquish their search for truth until they obtain the proof from the scriptures themselves now there are certain criteria common to all men such as the senses while the other tech nical criteria acquired by thought and reasoning to distinguish between true and false arguments are confined to those who have made truth their aim and practice but the chief thing is to get rid of self conceit taking a position midway between exact science and rash opinionativeness and to recognize that he who hopes for the eternal rest knows also that the entrance to it is toilsome and strait 16 but let not him who has once received the gospel and as it says embraced salvation with joy 17 in the hour when he became acquainted with it let not him i say turn back like lot's wife 18 nor recur to his former life which was devoted to the things of sense nor yet to the heresies for they in a sort imitate the heathen not knowing the true god for he 16 matt 7 14 matt 13 20 luke 17 31 32 154 clement of alexandria that loveth father or mother more than me 19 i.e than the true father and teacher of the truth who regenerates and re creates and nourishes the elect soul he saith he is not worthy of me worthy that is to be a son of god and at once a disciple and friend and kin to god for no man who looks backward and puts his hand to the plough is fit for the kingdom but just as most people even now believe as it seems that mary ceased to be a virgin through the birth of her child though this was not really the case for some say that she was found by the midwife to be a virgin after her delivery 21 94 so we find it to be with the lord's scriptures which bring forth the truth and yet remain virgins hiding within them the mysteries of the truth she has brought forth and has not brought forth 5 22 says the scripture speaking as of one who had conceived of herself and not from another wherefore the scrip tures are pregnant to the gnostics but the heretics not having examined them dismiss them as barren and though all men have the same faculty of judgment some find their grounds for belief in following the dictates of reason while others surrender themselves to pleasures and wrest the scripture to suit their desires but methinks the lover of truth needs energy of soul for they who set themselves to the greatest tasks must meet the greatest disasters unless they have received the canon of the truth from the truth itself and such persons having fallen away from the right path generally go wrong in particulars also as might be expected because they have no criterion of truth and falsehood accurately trained to make the right choice otherwise they would have believed the divine scriptures 95 as if then one were to become a beast instead of a man like those who were changed by circe's drugs 23 so is it with him who has spurned the tradition of the church and has sud denly taken up with the fancies of human sects he has lost the character of a man of god and of enduring trust in the lord but he who has returned from this deceit after hearing the is matt 10 37 20 luke 9 62 21 for the story of the midwife cf protevangelium of james 19 20 m r james apocr jv.t 46 for perpetual

instead of a man for in the lord we have the first principle of instruction guiding us to knowledge from first to last in divers ways and divers por tions 5 24 through the prophets and the gospel and the blessed apostles and if any one were to suppose that the first principle stood in need of something else it could no longer be really maintained as a first principle he then who of himself believes the lord's scripture and his actual voice is worthy of belief being one who would be naturally moved by the lord to act for the benefit of men certainly we use it as a criterion for the discovery of the real facts but whatever comes into judgment is not to be believed before it is judged so that what is in need of judgment cannot be a first principle with good reason there fore having apprehended our first principle by faith without proof we get our proofs about the first principle ex abundanti from the principle itself and are thus trained by the voice of the lord for the knowledge of the truth for we pay no attention to the mere assertions of men which may be met by equally valid assertions on the other side if however it is not enough just simply to state one's opinion but we are bound to prove what is said then we do not wait for the witness of men but we prove the point in question by the voice of the lord which is more to be relied on than any demonstration or rather which is the only real demonstration from this science it comes that while they who have but tasted of the scriptures are believers the gnostics who have made further progress are accurate judges of the truth since even in the ordinary concerns of life craftsmen have an advantage over laymen and give shape to finer models far surpassing common ideas 96 so too we obtaining from the scriptures themselves a perfect demonstration concerning the scriptures derive from faith a conviction which has the force of demonstration and though it be true that the heretics also have the audacity to make use of the prophetic scriptures yet in the first place they do not use them all and in the second place they do not use them in their entirety nor as the general frame and tissue of the prophecy suggest but picking out ambiguous phrases they turn them to their own opinions plucking a few scattered utterances without considering what is intended by them but perverting the bare letter as it stands for in almost all the pas sages they employ you will find how they attend to the words z:z 156 clement of alexandria alone while they change the meaning neither understanding them as they are spoken nor even using in their natural sense such extracts as they adduce but the truth is discovered not by altering the meanings of words for by so doing they will subvert all true teaching but by considering what is perfectly fitting and appropriate to the lord and the almighty god and by confirming each thing that is proved according to the scriptures from similar passages of the scriptures themselves hence they are neither ready to turn to the truth being ashamed to derogate from their own import ance nor have they any way of setting forth their own opinions but by doing violence to the scriptures having hastily pub lished to the world their false doctrines which are palpably at variance with almost all the scriptures and being always con futed by our opposing arguments they still even now persist in their refusal to accept some of the prophetic writings while on the other hand they accuse us of inability to understand what is peculiar to them as though we were quite of another nature and at other times they are driven to deny even their own doc trines being ashamed to confess openly what in private they boast of teaching 97 for so we shall find it to be in all the heresies when we examine the iniquities of their doctrines when they are refuted by plain proof on our part that they are opposed to the scrip tures you may see the upholders of the doctrine in question taking one or other of two courses they either make light of the consistency of their own doctrines or they make light of prophecy itself in other words of that which constitutes their own hope preferring on each occasion that which commends it self to their own reason rather than that which was spoken by the lord through the prophets and is attested and confirmed by the gospel as well as by the apostles perceiving then that it was not merely a single doctrine which was at stake but the keeping up of their heresies and having no desire to discover the truth for after reading the books we commonly use in public they despised them as worthless and aiming simply to exceed the common rule of the faith they abandoned the truth for being ignorant of the mysteries of the knowledge of the church and incapable of apprehending the grandeur of the truth they were too sluggish to penetrate to the bottom of the matter and so laid aside the scriptures after a superficial reading 98 being elated therefore by a conceit of wisdom they are constantly quarrelling showing that they care more to be on spiritual perfection 157 thought philosophers than to be so i n reality for instance though they lay no foundation of necessary principles but are moved simply by the opinions of men yet afterwards they labour to make the conclusion follow necessarily on their premises and for fear of being confuted keep sparring with those who pursue the true philosophy and their vanity impels them to endure everything and stir every stone as the phrase is even going to the length of impiety through disbelieving the scriptures rather than surrender their heresy and the much talked of precedence in their assemblies for the sake of which they so eagerly affect the first couch i n the drinking bout of their mis named agape 27 but the knowledge of truth which is found among us christians supplies from what is already believed faith for what is not yet believed faith which is so to speak the sub stance of demonstration on the other hand it seems that heresy of every kind has absolutely no ear for what is expedient but listens only to what is pleasurable otherwise a heretic might have been healed if he had only been willing to obey the truth now conceit like every other ailment requires a three fold freatment there must be a knowledge of the cause and of the w a y n wkic 1 tn i s ma y be removed and thirdly there must be discipline of the soul and the training which enables us to follow what is judged to be right 99 for as a clouded eye so too the soul that is confused by unnatural opinions is unable to discern accurately the light of truth but sees amiss even what lies before it certainly we are told that eels also lose their sight and are easily caught in turbid water 28 and just as naughty children lock out their tutor so the heretics shut out the prophecies from their church holding them in suspicion because they convict and admonish them i grant they patch up many lying inventions to give a sort of decent excuse for their neglect of the scriptures and herein they show their want of piety quarrelling as they do with the divine com mands that is with the holy spirit and as we call almonds empty not only when they have nothing in them but when what is in them is worthless so we say that the heretics are empty of the divine purposes and of the traditions of christ 25 aesch sept c 77i 577 cf plato rep 361 b for the quarrelsome behaviour of the heretical sects cf celsus in origen contra celsitm iii 10 v 63 2 matt 23 6 n on the riotous

wild almond except in so far as the clearness of the truth made it impossible for them to set aside or conceal it 100 as then in war the soldier must not leave the post assigned to him by the general so neither must we leave the post to which we are appointed by the word whom we have received as our captain both of knowledge and of life but the greater part of men have not inquired whether they ought to follow any guide and if so when and how he should be followed for as is the word such too should the life 29 of the believer be so as to be able to follow god as he holds his un swerving path 30 in all things from the beginning but when a man breaks his word and so sins against god if his weakness was due to a sudden impression he must take care to have reasonable impressions in readiness but if he is mastered by a habit that has gained dominion over him and has so become what the scripture calls gross 31 he must put an absolute stop to the habit and train his soul to resist it and if there are some who seem to be attracted by contradictory opinions they must gradually get rid of them and resort to those who can introduce harmony 32 of opinions those who can charm the timid and inexperienced with the spell of the divine scriptures making the truth plain by means of the agreement of the testa ments but as it seems we incline rather to the common opinion though it may involve contradiction than to the truth with its sternness and severity again of the three different mental conditions ignorance conceit knowledge ignorance is the characteristic of the heathen knowledge of the true church conceit of the heretics 101 certainly one does not find scientific men making more positive and definite assertions about the objects of their know ledge than these men about their opinions so far as depends on unproved assertion at any rate they despise and laugh at one another and it sometimes happens that the same interpretation is held in the highest honour by one set and regarded as insane by another and further we have learnt that there is a difference between voluptuousness which must be assigned to the heathen and strife which we must adjudge to the heresies and on the other hand between joy which one must appropriate to the church and gladness which must be imputed to the true gnostic and just as ischomachus will make those who attend 29 stoic maxim 30 plato legg 716 a 3i ex 1 7 32 matt 5 9 on spiritual perfection 159 to his instructions husbandmen and lampis sea captains and charidemus commanders and simon horsemen and perdix hucksters and grobylus cooks and archelaus dancers and homer poets and pyrrho wranglers and demosthenes orators and chrysippus logicians and aristotle men of science and plato philosophers 33 so he who obeys the lord and follows the prophecy given through him is fully perfected after the likeness of his teacher and thus becomes a god while still moving about in the flesh it is from such a height then that they fall who do not follow god wherever he may lead them and he leads them by way of the inspired writings 34 certainly though the number of human actions is infinite it may be said that there are only two causes of all failure both of which are in our own power viz ignorance and weakness on the part of those who are neither willing to learn nor to gain the mastery over their desires the former makes men judge wrongly the latter prevents them from follow ing out right judgments for neither could any one act rightly if he were deceived in his judgment even though he were per fectly able to carry out his determinations nor on the other hand w 7 ould he show himself blameless if he were a weakling in act whatever might be his capacity to discern what was right 1 02 corresponding to these there are also two kinds of dis cipline provided suitable for either class of failings for the one knowledge and the plain proof derived from the witness of the scriptures for the other training according to reason controlled by faith and fear and both of these grow up into perfect love for the end of the gnostic on earth is in my opinion twofold in some cases scientific contemplation in others action would that even these heretics would take a lesson from these suggestions and be reformed and turn to the almighty god but if like deaf adders they refuse to listen to the charm 35 new in form but most ancient in substance may they at any rate undergo the divine discipline submitting to the corrections of their heavenly father before the judgment until they become ashamed and repent instead of rushing headlong into utter condemnation through their stubborn disobedience for there are also partial forms of discipline which are called chastise ments into which most of us who have trespassed from among the lord's people slip and fall but as children are chastened 33 similar list of teachers in aelian var fast tv 16 perhaps from the same source as that followed by clement 34 gf ii tim 3 16 35 ps 58 4

public and private of those who are chastened these things i have set forth desiring to turn aside from their proclivity to heresy those who are eager to learn but as for others i have used these argu ments out of a longing desire to make them cease from the pre vailing ignorance or stupidity or ill condition or whatever it is to be called and endeavouring to persuade and bring over to the truth those who are not yet altogether incurable 103 for there are some who absolutely refuse to give ear to those who urge them to seek the truth aye and they aim at smartness pouring out blasphemous words against the truth while they credit themselves with the possession of the highest knowledge though they have not learnt or sought or laboured or discovered the harmony of truth men who excite our pity rather than our hate for such perverseness but if any one is still curable able to endure the plain speaking of the truth when it burns and cuts away their false opinions like the cautery or the knife let him lend an attentive ear and this will be so unless in their slothfulness they thrust away the truth or through ambition press after novelties for those are slothful who having it in their power to provide the fitting proofs for the divine scriptures from the scriptures themselves nevertheless select what is exclusively favourable to their own pleasures and those are ambitious who of set purpose explain away by other spurious arguments the beliefs which attach to the inspired words beliefs handed down by the blessed apostles and teachers and thus oppose divine tradition with human doctrines in order to establish their heresy for indeed what place was left among the great men of old i mean according to the judgment of the church for marcion say or prodicus 36 or the like who walked not along the straight road for they could not have surpassed in wisdom the men that went before so as to discover something beyond what had been truly spoken by them but might have been well content if they had been able to under stand what had been already handed down 104 we find then that the gnostic alone having grown old in the study of the actual scriptures guards the orthodox doctrine of the apostles and the church and lives a life of perfect recti tude in accordance with the gospel being aided by the lord to discover the proofs he is in search of both from the law and the 36 gf above iii 30 vii 41 on spiritual perfection l6l prophets for the life of the gnostic as it seems to me is nothing else than deeds and words agreeable to the tradition of the lord but knowledge belongeth not to all 37 for i would not have you ignorant says the apostle that all were under the cloud and partook of spiritual meat and drink 38 evidently arguing that not all who hear the word have been capable of under standing the greatness of knowledge both in deed and word wherefore also he added but he was not well pleased with all 39 who is meant by he it is he who said why call ye me lord and do not the will of my father 40 the teaching that is of the saviour which is our spiritual food 41 and a drink that knows no thirst 42 the water of gnostical life 43 aye say they we are told that knowledge puffeth up 5 44 to whom we reply perhaps seeming knowledge is said to puff up if it is supposed that the interpretation of the word is self conceit but if as is rather the case the apostle's language means to have lofty and true thoughts then the objection vanishes let us however confirm what has been said by following the scriptures 105 wisdom says solomon inspirited her own chil dren 45 assuredly the lord did not infuse conceit by means of the particular courses of instruction but faith in truth and con fidence in the knowledge handed down through the scriptures make a man disdain the seductions to sin and it is this disdain that is signified by the term inspirited it teaches the sub limity of the wisdom implanted in children by learning at any rate the apostle says and i will know not the speech of them that are inspirited but the power 46 whether ye have a lofty that is a true understanding of the scriptures 47 for nothing is higher than truth for herein lies the power of the inspirited children of wisdom meaning something of this sort i shall know whether ye take a just pride in knowledge for as david says in judah is god known 48 i.e to those who are israel ites according to knowledge for judah is by interpretation confession with reason therefore has it been said by the apostle this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not covet and if there be any other command it is briefly comprehended in this saying thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself 49 for we must never adulterate the truth nor steal the rule of the church as those who follow the 37 i cor 8 7 38 i cor 10 1 4 39 i cor 10 5 40 luke 6 46 matt 7 21 41 i cor 10 3 john 4 14 43 rev 22 17 44 1 g r 8 1 45 ecclesiasticus 4 11 46 i cor 4 19 47 luke 24 45 48

but as many as flatter with their tongues 51 have their punishments prescribed chapter xvii 1 06 they then who engage in impious words and introduce them to others and make no good use but an utterly wrong use of the divine words such men neither enter themselves into the kingdom of god nor permit 5 52 those whom they have deceived to attain to the truth nay they have not even got the key 53 of the door themselves but only a false or as it is commonly called a skeleton key which does not enable them to throw open the main door 54 and enter as we do through the tradi tion of the lord but they cut a side door and break secretly through the wall of the church and so overstepping the bounds of truth they initiate the soul of the impious into their mysteries for it needs no long discourse to prove that the merely human assemblies which they have instituted were later in time than the catholic church for the teaching of our lord during his life upon earth begins under augustus and tiberius and is completed in the middle of the reign of the latter and the preach ing of his apostles at least up to the end of paul's ministry is completed under nero while the heresiarchs began quite late about the time of the emperor hadrian and lasted to the age of antoninus the elder as was the case with basilides in spite of his claiming to have been taught by glaucias whom they them selves boast to have been the interpreter of peter so too they report that valentinus heard theodas who was a disciple of paul 107 for marcion who lived about the same time asso ciated with them as an elder with his juniors after him simon was for a short time a hearer of peter 54a such being the case it is evident that these later heresies and those which are still more recent are spurious innovations on the

righteous according to the divine purpose are enrolled for god being one and the lord being one that also which is supremely hon oured is the object of praise because it stands alone being a copy of the one first principle at any rate the one church which they strive to break up into many sects is bound up with the principle of unity we say then that the ancient and catho lic church stands alone in essence and idea and principle and pre eminence gathering together by the will of one god through the one lord into the unity of the one faith built upon the fitting covenants or rather the one covenant given at dif ferent times all those who are already enlisted in it whom god foreordained having known before the foundation of the world 55 that they would be righteous and further the pre eminence of the church like the principle of its constitution is in accordance with the monad surpassing all other things and having nothing like or equal to itself 1 08 of this we shall speak on a future occasion but of the heresies some are called after the name of the founder as that which is called after valentinus and marcion and basilides though the last sect professes to cite the opinion of matthias 56 1 say professes for as the teaching so also the tradition of all the apostles has been one and the same other heresies are called from the place where they arose as the peratici others from their nationality as the phrygian heresy others from their prac tice like the encratites others from peculiar opinions as the docetae and haematitae others from the personages they admire as the cainites and those who are styled ophites others from their unblushing immoralities as the so called entychitae among the simonians chapter xviii 109 before closing my discourse i should like for the benefit of the more speculative members of the church to throw a little light from the sacrificial law concerning clean and unclean beasts in reference to the ordinary jews and the heresies which are mystically distinguished as unclean from the church of god we are taught by the scriptures that the victims which divide the hoof and chew the cud are clean 57 and acceptable to god implying that the righteous make their approach to the 55 eph 1 14 5 56 cf note on strom vii 82 above 57 lev x 1 3 f 164 clement of alexandria father and the son through their faith for in this consists the stability of those that divide the hoof and that they study and ruminate the oracles of god 58 by night and day 59 in the mental receptacle of knowledge which being also a kind of gnostic discipline is figuratively described in the law as the chewing of the cud by a clean animal but those who are wanting in both or even in one of these qualifications are rejected for instance those which chew the cud without dividing the hoof signify the jews generally who have the oracles of god 58 in their mouth but have not the firm footing of faith stayed upon truth which carries them to the father through the son whence this class of creatures is liable to slip as is natural where the foot is not parted and they are not stayed upon the doubleness of faith for we read no one knows the father but the son and he to whom the son may reveal him 60 on the other hand those too are unclean which divide the hoof without chewing the cud for this phrase denotes the heretics who take their stand on the name of the father and of the son but have no power to bring out the exact perspicuity of the oracles by subtle distinctions and by smoothing away of difficulties while their prosecution of the works of righteousness if they prosecute them at all is rough and careless rather than exact no it is to some such persons that the lord says why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say 561 but those who do not divide the hoof nor chew the cud are utterly unclean as theognis says you megarians are neither in the third class nor even the twelfth nor in any number or account whatever but are

have scattered the sparks of the doctrines of the true knowledge dispersedly here and there as we promised so that it should not be easy for the uninitiated who came across them to discover the holy tradi tions let us pass on to our general argument in now it seems that what are known as miscellanies are not to be compared to ornamental parks with rows of ordered 5 8 rom 3 2 num 24 16 59 p s i 2

planes and bay tree and ivy and at the same time planted with apple trees and olives and figs the cultivation of fruit bearing and of woodland trees being inten tionally mingled together since the scripture desires to with draw from observation on account of those who venture secretly to steal its fruits it is by transplanting the suckers and trees from these preserves that the gardener will

early church and a critical examination of them in detail is not called for here in a context which is concerned rather with one of his writings inasmuch however as this is a devotional work it may be appropriate in a rapid sketch of his career to dwell upon those facts in it which testify to that rich inner experience of which the treatise on prayer is a notable expression origen was born about the year 1 86 and most probably in alexandria although we are never told so in so many words the name origen has been derived by some from the name of the egyptian god horus the suggestion being that he was born on the anniversary day of that god and if this be correct it would go far to show that at the time of his birth his parents or at least his father were pagans that this was probably so other facts serve to suggest when in 1202 a persecution against jews and christians suddenly burst out at alexandria leonides origen's father was arrested now this persecution under septimius severus was not aimed at extirpating judaism or christianity but rather at propaganda at these religions making converts spartian 1 says that under a grave penalty severus forbade jews to make proselytes and also issued a similar order against christians if then leonides was a convert to christianity of only a few years standing for origen was little more than a boy when the persecution broke out we can understand how such a decree might retrospectively fall harshly upon such as he in any case we may detect in the picture that eusebius draws of leonides 2 the fervent zeal of one who had come to embrace a i severus i6f 2 vi i 23 1 13 171 172 origen new faith he was at great pains not only to instruct the boy in the scriptures but also to give them a primary place in his studies the boy's early proficiency in sacred learning filled the father with a delight which was none the less sincere because he felt it prudent to conceal it like many a parent before and after him he recognized with wonderment and yet with humble thankfulness that god had chosen him to be the father of a saint 3 it is not difficult in any case to see in leonides the primary human source from which origen drew that fervent devotion to god to which the pages of on prayer bear so eloquent a testimony of origen's mother and the part she played in his christian upbringing we know nothing it can scarcely be urged against the sincerity of her faith that she strove to prevent her son from achieving his desire for martyrdom by the effective if somewhat crude method of hiding his clothes so that he could not leave the house by day for indeed at that early age he was not yet seventeen when his father suffered martyrdom origen was filled as eusebius says with a zeal intense beyond his years 4 this manifested itself in various ways in his refusal to have any thing to do with heretics or heresies even at the risk of offending a generous benefactress of his in his open espousal of the cause of martyrs on trial or in prison and especially in his asceticism de faye indeed affirms that this was not derived from chris tianity but from philosophy asceticism was in the air he says an element in that religious syncretism which was so marked a feature of the egypt of that time and origen in this followed the example of his day 5 it is true that in describing origen's asceticism eusebius speaks of him as living like a philosopher 6 but he also expressly states that certain elements at any rate in his manner of life at that time found their express sanction in the gospel those sayings which exhort us not to provide two coats nor to use shoes nor indeed to be worn out with thoughts of the future 7 it was not as we shall see the only occasion on which a literal following of an evangelical command guided his conduct origen's gifts and the need for their use at that time decided at once what his career should be the origins of the catechetical school at alexandria are obscure but they seem to have been fortuitous all we know is that a person named pantaenus gathered round him a number of young men for the study and 3 see the passage quoted on p 186 4 h.e vi 2 6 i 13 s h.e f vi 3 9 7 jiid m vi 2 10 cf matt 10 10 6 34 general introduction 173 exposition of the scriptures among them was clement who had arrived at alexandria on his travels in search of knowledge and having discovered pantaenus had attached himself to this group of students on the death of pantaenus clement under took the direction of the school such a voluntary association of learners was not novel in the world of that day we are not to think of it as a university or theological college in the modern sense of the term all was free and unofficial the authority exercised by the head was auctoritas rather than potestas the authority of the expert of the teacher whose reputation learning and skill in teaching were sufficient to create his clientele cle ment had chosen pantaenus as his teacher for that reason and when clement fled from alexandria on the persecution of severus 202 203 origen was selected as his successor it may be that the circumstances of the time created a limited choice but in any case origen was known to be clement's most brilliant pupil although apparently only his pupil for a short time he was then under eighteen years of age but all accounts speak of his precocity his competence as a teacher was already recog nized his zeal was undaunted by the dangers that confronted an open profession of the christian way of life and so this boy succeeded to the chair of a venerable and learned teacher of over fifty years of age from the first origen appears to have been successful as head of the school and as time went on his reputation increased and more and more pupils came to him had the state of the church at alexandria been normal the free and independent position that pantaenus and clement had enjoyed might have been his too but persecution had driven from the city those to whom the instruction of catechumens would naturally have been en trusted and in their absence demetrius the bishop of alex andria committed to origen alone that task 8 even then all went happily at first and none could have foreseen that the direct link with ecclesiastical authority would have had such tragic consequences the school attracted pupils of greater proficiency and learning so much so that whereas origen had previously eschewed the teaching of pagan letters and indeed is said to have sold off his classical books he was now com pelled to resume the study of greek philosophy 9 place it upon his curriculum and assign the teaching of the less mature pupils to an assistant named heraclas it would appear to be during this period of expansion eusebius h.k vi 3 8 ibid ch 15 18 19 174 origen probably before 2 10 that origen performed the act which was to be used by his subsequent detractors to his lasting disadvantage finding that pupils of both sexes were coming to his classes he took the saying there are eunuchs which made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake in too literal and extreme a sense 10 it has been frequently remarked how strange it was that origen the allegorizer par excellence of the scriptures should in this in stance have fallen into the opposite error we have seen how ever that previously he had based ascetic practices upon a literal interpretation of sayings in the gospel and few are abso lutely consistent when it comes to applying biblical principles to their own case the truth probably is that by nature and dis position origen was inclined towards severity to the body and this tendency was reinforced by his platonic idealism nor have we reason to believe that in the alexandria of his day or at any rate in the circle in which he moved his action would necessarily be censured eusebius indeed says that demetrius got to know of it later and while he marvelled exceedingly at him for his rash act he approved the zeal and sincerity of his faith bade him be of good cheer and urged him to attach him self now all the more to the work of instruction 11 the story of the worsening in relations between demetrius and origen cannot be told in detail for sufficient materials are lacking and we can only put forward probable reasons clearly the bishop had a right to supervise origen's movements since preparation of the catechumens apart from the other teaching of the school was a matter for which the church authorities were ultimately responsible but origen s fame was now becom ing world wide he was invited to pay visits to other parts of the world for example to arabia and palestine and when at caesarea although still a layman was requested to discourse and expound the scriptures publicly in the church there we are left in no doubt of the fact that demetrius resented this per mission being given he wrote that such a thing had never been heard of nor taken place hitherto that laymen should preach in the presence of bishops in defence of their action alexander bishop of jerusalem and theoctistus bishop of caesarea point out that demetrius's statement was incorrect and from their own knowledge cite other instances of laymen being allowed by bishops to preach 12 this incident which took place about 215 passed off demetrius recalled origen by letter sending messengers to urge 10 eusebius h.e vi 8 2 n ibid 8 3 ibid 19 17 18 general introduction 175 his speedy return and he resumed the work of the school as diligently as before clearly however demetrius felt that his authority was being challenged and it may be also that he was jealous of origen's fame a further reason for the bishop's action may have lain in the development of church order at that time at alexandria according to the famous if much disputed statement of jerome 13 down to the episcopates of heraclas the successor of demetrius and dionysius the presbyters at alex andria always chose one of their number and styled him bishop apparently without consecration if this be so it may well be that during the long term of office of demetrius 190 233 things at alexandria were already moving towards such a system of monarchical episcopacy as encouraged demetrius to emphasize his authority the order of incidents connected with origen's final depart ure from alexandria is uncertain since the evidence of eusebius and photius and others does not tally at every point but of the main facts and their permanent result we are left in little doubt it is clear that even before he left alexandria for good con siderable tension prevailed the year was 231 232 origen had then got as far as the fifth tome of his commentary on john and though as he says 14 the storm at alexandria seemingly hindered his work he succeeded in dictating what was given him to say for jesus rebuked the winds and the waves of the sea when he had proceeded some way upon the sixth tome he was rescued from egypt god who had brought out his people thence delivering him it seems on the whole most probable that this deliverance came to him through a call to important work in greece to which he travelled by way of palestine 15 but while at caesarea a momentous thing hap pened he was ordained presbyter by the bishops there and if we are to follow at this point the translation or paraphrase of the church history of eusebius made by rufinus they were about to raise him to the episcopate 16 when demetrius hearing of what was afoot spread the information about his act of self mutilation when a young man for the purpose not only of stop ping origen's consecration but also of censuring even those who had raised him to the presbyterate the action taken by demetrius in alexandria itself is obscure in its details but it would appear that he summoned one or two synods of bishops 13 ep cxlvi i n in joh vi 2 is eusebius h.e vi 23 4 lawlor and oulton ii 218 is summo eum sacerdotio iam iamque dignum probarent ibid 9 vi 8 4 origen the upshot of which was that origen was not only excluded from alexandria but also deprived of the priesthood his degradation was communicated to all bishops and jerome is our authority for stating that all endorsed it with the exception of the bishops of palestine arabia phoenicia and achaia 17 this was the greatest spiritual crisis in origen's life and it is worthy of note that he met it like a true christian philosopher though the enemy i.e demetrius made war most bitterly against us by means of his new letters which were truly at en mity with the gospel and though he stirred up against us all the winds of wickedness reason 18 called me to stand firm for the contest and to preserve the inner self 19 lest haply evil thoughts should have power to bring the storm against my soul also rather than to compose the rest of the book out of season before my mind had recovered its calm 20 in other words origen's chief concern in this situation was to preserve his spiritual forces unbroken de faye has expressed this with sympathy and insight what appears to have caused him the most anxiety was not so much the consequences that might result from the furious campaign of demetrius as the effect that might be pro duced in his own thoughts by so bitter and odious a conflict origen trembled as he says for his own soul it might founder in the tempest elsewhere he expresses himself more directly he was afraid of being embittered of getting into a passion of replying by the same methods to the malicious insinuations and calumnies nevertheless he emerged from the tempest intact what was it that preserved him he tells us with a clarity which leaves no room for any doubt it was his mystical faith in jesus that he is fully aware lifted him above sentiments and passions which an injustice of this kind might easily have engendered in him 21 that origen was successful in achieving this spiritual con quest is also evident not only from his resumption of literary work generally but also from the treatise on prayer in particular which as we shall see 22 was composed in 233 or 234 that is within a year or so of the storm at alexandria which caused him to leave it and its old associations for ever and to settle down eventually at caesarea as he says himself 23 the fiery darts of 7 ep 33 5 84 10 but see p 432 and the arguments there put forward for holding another view of the reasons for origen's condemnation is or the word i lit the guiding principle 20 in jvh vi 2 21 origtne i 38 39 42 p 181 23 joh vi 2 general introduction 177 the wicked had been quenched by god his soul had become accustomed to what had happened he had learned to bear with equanimity the attacks of his enemies and as it were a period of calm weather had set in and as we shall also see one of the features of the treatise is its insistence upon the right disposition of him who engages in prayer he must come to it without dis traction without anger without malice the remainder of origen's life can be summarized briefly here eventually he settled at caesarea in palestine and made it his home certainly before 240 the intervening years were marked by much travelling in the course of which he visited athens ephesus antioch caesarea in cappadocia and also tyre with which he appears to have been associated more definitely his reputation in general does not seem to have suf fered as a result of the storm at alexandria demetrius died soon afterwards in 233 and he was succeeded by origen 5 s old assistant in the school heraclas origen established another school at caesarea to which he attracted some of the most brilliant christian pupils of that day who were afterwards des tined as bishops to mould the theology of succeeding centuries gregory thaumaturgus bishop of neocaesarea in pontus who has left us a panegyric of his master 24 his brother athenodorus firmilian of caesarea in cappadocia and others he was also sought after as a consultant theologian on many occasions we hear of him being called in to refute the errors of beryllus bishop of bostra in arabia concerning the person of jesus christ and again also in arabia about the soul and the resur rection 25 within recent years the record 26 has been discovered of a discussion also held by origen with a bishop named hera cleides and other bishops associated with him coram populo on the father the son and the soul the editor 27 supposes that this also took place in arabia in all these it seems to have been assumed that origen was the right person to give the correct and orthodox answers on the points in dispute whether those answers would satisfy the church today is another matter at the same time it would appear that origen's soundness in the faith was not everywhere unchallenged according to eusebius he wrote to fabian and to very many other rulers of churches with reference to his orthodoxy 28 it is scarcely sufficient to 24 see below p 179 eusebius h.e vi ch 33 37 2 a translation with introduction and notes by the rev henry ghadwick is included in this volume 27 j scherer cairo 1949 8 h.e vi 36 4 a.c 12 178 origen suppose as de faye does 29 that this was merely to repudiate falsi fications of what he had actually said in public discussions that he was sometimes misrepresented is undoubtedly true but the phrase very many other rulers of churches 30 suggests on the evidence of his warm admirer that origen's teaching had even in his own lifetime given rise to widespread questioning we need not seek to give a detailed account of origen's life after his departure from alexandria indeed the evidence upon which such an account could be based is lacking it was how ever the period of his most prolific literary activity he had begun to write in 218 and even before 231 portions of two im portant works the de principiis and the commentary on john had been completed but after 231 not only were these works finished but a great number of other commentaries were writ ten and in addition special works such as the treatise on prayer the treatise on martyrdom and the long and important book contra celsum moreover origen had always been a fluent viva wee expounder of scripture but it was not until he was sixty years of age c 246 that he allowed his homilies as he called them to be taken down in shorthand and published these were of a simpler more popular character and were in tended for those who could not follow the more difficult com mentaries from which however they differed in presentation rather than in fundamental ideas or doctrine it is certain that only a fraction perhaps one third of his enormous literary output is extant the treatise on martyrdom written in 235 makes it clear that origen now a man of fifty had not changed in his ideas since a boy as concerning the highest form of christian witness martyrdom was in his opinion the supreme achievement of the christian life there can be little doubt that he would have desired this end for himself but if martyrdom in the commonly accepted sense of the term was denied him he may certainly be ranked high among the confessors the persecution of decius broke out in 249 and under it origen suffered all but the ex treme penalty eusebius speaks 31 of what he endured for the word of christ chains and tortures punishments inflicted on his body punishments as he lay in irons and in the recesses of his dungeon and cruel stretching of his legs for many days on end in the stocks but he survived all this and so was enabled to encourage others and especially the faint hearted by his ex 29 ij 43 3 de faye omits to take in consideration these words si h.e vi 39 4 general introduction 179 ample and his helpful words no doubt his sufferings hastened his end which took place probably at tyre in 255 when he was sixty nine years of age de faye says of the treatise on martyrdom veut on con naitre le chr6tien qu'etait origene c'est la qu'il faut le cher cher 32 the same might be said of the de orations which reveals origen as a man of prayer who was not content simply to deal with the matter of prayer in general as he might have done in the circumstances but was also anxious to speak of christian prayer as taught by the saviour his words and his example and what it involves for us who engage in it both in the inner life and in the life of action this we hope will be made plain in the introduction and in the treatise itself but it may be well to illustrate this aspect of origen from another source and for this we may select the panegyric on origen by gregory thauma turgus to which we have already referred there is much in this composition which is artificial rhetorical and even ful some we cannot read it aright unless we relate it to similar compositions of the schools nevertheless it is impossible not to recognize under its exuberant verbiage the genuine love of the writer for origen as a teacher and a man here it will be suffi cient to quote the closing section 33 which has a special appro priateness when we consider that it is addressed to the author of the de oratione gregory and his brother after many years of instruction under origen are about to leave for their own country and gregory bids his master farewell in these words do thou dear heart arise and when thou hast prayed send us on our way having kept us safely when we were with thee by thy holy teaching so continue to keep us safely when we are away from thee by thy prayers do thou commit and commend us continually or rather commit us to him who led us to thee even god giving him thanks for all that has been granted us in the past and imploring him still to lead us by his hand to watch over us always in the days to come to instil into our minds his precepts and to fill us with that godly fear which will be the best guide of our steps in the future for when we are gone from thee our service of him will lack that freedom which it had in thy company implore him to vouchsafe us some encouragement when we lose thy presence to send us an angel to be our good conductor upon the way and entreat him also to turn our steps and bring us back to thee for that is the one thing above all else which should prove our consolation 32 i 45 33 i n origenem oratzo panegyrica ch xix p.g x noi on prayer introduction the occasion of the treatise on prayer the treatise on prayer and the exhortation to martyrdom are distinctive among the extant works of origen as being occasional in respect of their composition that is to say they were called forth by the special needs of a particular incident de faye 1 styles them happily enough merits de circonstance it was otherwise with the de principiis in which origen deliberately attempted to give a systematic exposition of theology or the hexapla the fruit of his textual studies or the commentaries and homilies which he poured forth during his lifetime as an expounder of holy scripture the contra celsum although it was an answer to a particular book the true word of the philosopher celsus can hardly be ranked as an occasional writing since it was composed about seventy years after the book to which it was a reply but the exhortation to martyrdom was written for the immediate object of consoling and exhorting two of his friends who had been cast into prison for their faith and the treatise on prayer arose similarly out of a particular occasion just as i corinthians may be said to have been written at any rate in part in order to answer certain questions put to paul by the corinthian church or individuals in it so also on prayer arose as we shall see out of a specific question about prayer in both cases the answer in scope and fullness far trans cended the limits which the particular situation necessitated the year when on prayer was written can be determined with more or less exactitude 2 a topical allusion has been usually found in the language of xxviii 10 certain persons i know 1 1 190 2 see koetschau i lxxv lxxvii de faye follows koetschau in the matter of date i 190 191 180 on prayer l8l not how arrogating to themselves powers beyond the priestly office perhaps because they have no accurate grasp of the know ledge that a priest should possess boast that they are able to pardon even idolatry and to absolve adultery and fornication on the ground that by means of prayer offered for those who have committed these deeds even the sin unto death is absolved 33 the most obvious reference in this is to be found not to powers exercised by martyrs and confessors who were not necessarily priests but to callistus bishop of rome c 217 223 who was accused by the rigorist party of that day and notably by hippolytus of laxity in the matter of pardons and absolutions and since the plural certain persons is used the reference is extended to include the successors of callistus namely urbanus 223 230 and pontianus 230 235 under whom the hippolytean schism is supposed to have continued with this controversy at any rate in its earlier stages origen was personally acquainted for he visited rome about the year 212 and listened at least on one occasion to the preaching of hippolytus who at that time was engaged in his feud against zephyrinus the predecessor of callistus whom zephyrinus had made his archdeacon 3 origen's temperament would naturally lead him to support the rigorist party literary allusions in the treatise serve to date it more exactly 1 in xxiii 4 origen refers to his comment on the passage gen 3 8 9 now the commentaries on genesis were begun at alexandria and eight volumes were written there 4 the remain ing four being added at caesarea in the twelve volumes he only covered the first four chapters of genesis 5 the comment on gen 3 8 9 can hardly therefore have been in one of the earlier volumes and in any case he speaks of the commentaries on genesis as a completed work we have treated these matters at length in our commentaries on genesis this places the treatise on prayer after his removal to caesarea i.e after 231 or 232 2 there is a reference in xv i in the words as is shown else where to the tenth tome of the commentary on john 6 the present tense is taken by koetschau and de faye to indicate that this commentary was still in process of being written in any case tomes vi xxii were written after origen had left alex andria in caesarea and according to koetschau between 232 and 235 therefore 233 or 234 may be conjectured as the date of the composition of the treatise on prayer 3 further in this 3 lawlor and oulton ii 201 4 eusebius h.e vi 24 5 contra celsum vi 49 x 37 21 brooke i 230 l82 origen treatise there is no reference to martyrdom although the oppor tunity to do so is not lacking 7 this is a reason for placing its composition before the persecution of maximin 235 237 the immediate occasion of the treatise was a letter addressed to origen by his friend ambrose in association with a lady named tatiana which stated either on their own behalf or on that of others certain objections and difficulties in regard to the practice of prayer 8 from this letter origen quotes a passage which makes it quite clear what was the nature of the difficulties urged against it first if god knows the future beforehand and it must come to pass prayer is vain secondly if all things happen according to the will of god and if what is willed by him is fixed and nothing of what he wills can be changed prayer is vain 9 had origen been acquainted with milton he might have pointed out to ambrose and tatiana that such questions were discussed and discussed in vain by the fallen angels who reasoned high of providence foreknowledge will and fate fix'd fate free will foreknowledge absolute and found no end in wandring mazes lost 10 but to evade a difficulty or to give it up as insoluble was never origen's way and least of all could he have adopted such a method towards a request made by ambrose he was of course none other than his devoted patron friend and admirer to whom he owed both the incentive to produce books if indeed origen needed any such incentive and also the abundant means to produce them as to the incentive origen playfully refers to ambrose as his task master or slave driver epyo siouktt ex 3 7 5 6 14 and in a fragment of a letter printed by delarue i 3 gives a lively picture of his impor tunities the holy ambrose supposing that i am a zealous worker and utterly athirst for the word of god convicted me by his own zeal for work and passion for sacred studies for neither when we are engaged in collating can we take our meals nor when we have taken them walk and rest our bodies nay even at the times set apart for these things we are constrained to discourse learnedly and to correct our manuscripts neither can we sleep at night for the good of our bodies since our learned discourse extends far into the evening i need not mention that 7 e.g xxv 3 xxix 2 s n j y i 6 9 v 6 10 paradise lost ii 558 561 on prayer 183 our morning studies also are prolonged to the ninth at times to the tenth hour 11 ambrose was equally insistent in supplying origen unstintingly for he was a wealthy man with the means to produce his commentaries and also we cannot doubt such a treatise as the present one thanks to his liberality as origen dictated there were ready at hand more than seven shorthand writers who relieved each other at fixed times and as many copyists as well as girls skilled in penmanship 5 12 the picture reminds us of a professor today in a university in the new world who can command unlimited resources in respect of money and material and helpers for the production of learned works cover ing a vast field of inquiry therefore we can understand how origen even when engaged on a large and important work such as the commentaries on john could at the same time break in upon it and also produce a treatise which not only answered the particular questions propounded to him by his friends but also as we shall see went on to deal with prayer in general and to give a lengthy exposition of the lord's prayer his mind through long training and practice was fully equipped with a working knowledge of the principal philosophical systems his knowledge of holy scripture was unrivalled as an exegete his skill was remarkable with all this knowledge and capacity in himself he had only to dictate what flowed from his teeming brain to the shorthand writers eusebius notes that there were more than seven of them and that they relieved one another at fixed times no doubt when origen was dictating such an arrangement was as humane as it was necessary then the copyists transcribed the shorthand into longhand and finally the girl scribes produced neatly written copies of the work later on we shall give an analysis of the treatise it is suffi cient to say here that origen himself gives a brief description of its contents in ch xxxiv when he speaks of having treated i the problem of prayer and 2 the prayer that is found in the gospels and the preceding context in matthew we must add however to these a third section containing a supplement to the general discussion of prayer which should more appropriately have come after section i the work was in fact somewhat hastily put together and origen seems to have been aware of this for in his concluding words he expresses the hope that he may be able to treat again of these same matters with greater 11 see lawlor and oulton ii 213 f 12 eusebius h.e vi 23 cp j de ghellinck patristique et moym age ii 2 15 f 184 origen breadth and elevation and clarity and adds for the present you will read this book with indulgence furthermore we can detect throughout the composition signs which indicate a diversity of aim origen in fact wished at one and the same time to answer the questions of ambrose and tatiana and dis sipate their doubts to handle the subject of prayer generally and finally to give an exposition of the lord's prayer as a result both here and in the treatise on martyrdom matter which should have been combined is broken up and origen repeats himself 13 these faults in structural arrangement however do not seriously detract from the general effect of the treatise which is perhaps the most readable of his works 14 and reveals attractively many of his characteristic qualities to these we shall now turn general characteristics of origen to a student of church history the most obvious aspect of origen is that he represents the greek element in christianity as did also his predecessor in the catechetical school at alex andria clement we cannot however simply leave the matter there but rather must go on to ask which chaj qteri ticsj the greek genius does he xemphfy the moment this questionts asked we begirf to see that we must qualify such a general description and distinguish between certain elements within it origenshows for example little appreciation of greek lit.era tureatsucl 15 in his day at alexandria homer was the bible anctthetbtindation of secular letters his poetry represents per haps better than any other writer the soul of the greek genius and the imagination of the race origen cites him.frequently in his other works and calls him the best of.pqets a i6 but he shows little appreciation of his purely poetical qualities it is the same with the other rather few greek poets that he quotes from or refers to such as hesiod euripides aristophanes callimachus apollonius rhodius the references to hesiod are particularly significant as de faye points out 17 this poet inspires in him no admiration he makes fun of celsus because he calls him a divine poet he appears to find no grace or beauty is koetschau i ixxxi 14 no writing of origen is more free from his characteristic faults or more full of beautiful thoughts b f westcott in d.c.b iv 124 15 see de faye i ch 14 i contra celsum vii 6 on prayer 185 in the description of the formation of pandora which he trans cribes in fact hesiod is for him only a retailer of myths for the prose writers of greece in the day of its glory origen shows no greater appreciation nor for its art neither does origen exhibit the greek genius in his style and method of composition not for him the no thing too much or the half is greater than the whole on the contrary he is dif fuse discursive repetitive his immense erudition and especially his biblical knowledge frequently leads him aside into irrele vant digressions the torrent of words and exuberance of ideas are at times reminiscent of the opening chapter of ephesians they certainly do not recall the reticence and restraint and economy of the classical period of greek literature if greek balance is to be seen at all in origen it is in his grasp of the christian revelation as a number of related truths his de prin cipiis is the first and perhaps the greatest work on systematic theology but this attempt to see life steadily and see it whole was due i imagine less to an inner sense of artistic completeness than to a grasp of divine revelation as a unifying principle that god shall be all in all was the vision which dominated his thinking and gave form to his conception of all things whether in heaven or on earth the greek element in origen is most truly seen in his love of inquiry and speculation his training in philosophy and his subsequent teaching of it implanted in him the habit which be came a second nature of asking questions of probing into the meaning of things and of conjecturing when no certain answ r er could be found as a biblical student he is never tired of wrest ing from a passage its inner meaning of comparing one passage with another and of confronting difficulties that may thereby arise after the manner of the schools his custom is to bring for ward an objector imaginary or real this method of conducting an argument occurs again and again perhaps we owe paul's doctrine of the resurrection body to the question of an inquiring and quick witted greek but some one will say how are the dead raised 1 we meet the same kind of thing frequently even in a treatise such as on prayer and this is not surprising because for origen christianity was chiefly an illumination of the reason which by itself and without revelation was incapable of know ing god and growth in grace was a deeper and deeper appre hension of divine mysteries and of the logos as he communicates himself more and more to the soul of man so it was that living i cor 15 35 19 see p 270 l86 origen in a day when few at any rate in alexandria questioned the validity of the allegorical method of interpreting the scriptures origen regarded it as one of the highest achievements to pierce beneath the outward and obvious meaning of a passage to the hidden and esoteric meaning that lay beneath and even if such a meaning escapes our present understanding origen is sure that it exists and is known to the divine logos who has con templated the father's will 20 it would be a great mistake however to picture origen as a mere intellectualist and his religion as simply and solely a kind of higher gnosis the intellectual side of him was balanced by purity of soul flame of devotion and virtue of life dedicated to god or genuinely devoted to god 21 was for him a descrip tion of the true christian if on the one hand he seems to lay much stress upon prayer as contemplation of god on the other he speaks of the whole life of the saint as one great unbroken prayer since he combines with the prayer the needful deeds and the prayer with the fitting actions 22 again and again he reminds us of the duty of love and forgiveness a virtue which in view of his cruel wrongs he had himself much occasion to prac tise 23 from boyhood his joul was aflame for martyrdom and there is little doubt that the end of his life was hastened by the tortures he endured for the name of christ origen was indeed one of those rare souls whose light shineth more and more unto the perfect day 24 whether his doctrine of the pre existence of souls is true or false it seemed from the first that his body was inhabited by something from another sphere it is said that many a time his father would stand over the sleeping boy and uncover his breast as if a divine spirit were enshrined therein and kissing it with reverence count himself happy in his goodly offspring 25 in his capacity for combining as a unity in himself intellectual passion with warm personal devotion to god in christ and the practical virtues of a christian origen is perhaps unique among the fathers he had many disciples and has had many fol lowers but never one of them who equalled him in this arno bius could write a long work without revealing a distinctively christian spirit boethius could keep his philosophy and theology apart and write the consolations of philosophy without betraying that he was a christian we have only to reflect for 20 xxvii 14 21 ix 2 xiii 5 22 xii 2 23 see ix 3 xxviii 7 8 24 prov 4 18 25 eusebius h.r vi 2 1 1 on prayer 187 a moment to see that such detachment would be impossible for origen john scotus erigena is a kind of throw back to origen across a gulf of some six hundred years and like origen was a great intellectualist but we have no reason to suppose that he matched him as a devotional or practical christian hence to follow origen in his never resting spirit of inquiry concerning all things would inevitably involve for lesser mortals a less sure grasp of christianity as a way of personal life this thought has been beautifully expressed in the lines of isaac williams in the lyra apostolica into god's word as in a palace fair thou leadest on and on while still beyond each chamber touched by holy wisdom's wand another opes more beautiful and rare and thou in each art kneeling down in prayer from link to link of that mysterious bond seeking for christ but oh i fear thy fond and beautiful torch that with so bright a flare lighteth up all things lest the heaven lit brand of thy serene philosophy divine should take the colourings of earthly thought and i by their sweet images o'erwrought led by weak fancy should let go truth's hand and miss the way into the inner shrine 26 the treatise on prayer and origen's orthodoxy the concluding words of the poem just quoted lead us natur ally to consider those questions concerning origen's orthodoxy that arise out of the treatise on prayer the first of these is con cerned with the person to whom prayer should be addressed it is commonly stated that origen teaches that prayer is to be made to god alone and not to christ this is not quite accurate origen following i tim 2 1 makes a distinction between four forms of prayer namely supplications prayers intercessions thanksgivings xiv 2 of these he says intercession and thanksgiving maybe addressed to all men christians saints or not while supplication may be made to saints only xiv 5 it follows then a fortiori that thanksgiving and intercession and supplication may be addressed to 26 i owe tliis reference to a r whitham history of the christian ckttrck 138 l88 origen christ who has wrought such benefits for us by the will of the father and indeed origen quotes from scripture an example of intercession to christ namely the words of stephen lord lay not this sin to their charge 5 27 it is only then prayer 55 in the special sense of the term that is to be addressed to the father alone origen defines this kind of prayer as follows prayer 5 he says is offered in a dignified manner with ascription of praise by some one concerning matters of importance 3528 he gives two examples of this which how ever do not quite seem to square with his own definition i a prayer of habakkuk the prophet with a song o lord i have heard thy voice and was afraid o lord i perceived thy works and was astounded in the midst of two living creatures thou shalt be known when the years draw nigh thou shalt be observed 29 2 jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly and he said i called in my affliction unto the lord my god and he heard me out of the belly of hell thou heardest my crying even my voice thou didst cast me forth into the depths of the heart of the sea and the rivers were round about me 5 30 but in the first of these it is not easy to see what are the matters of importance concerning which the prayer is offered and in the second there is no ascription of praise it would seem therefore that origen has not quite clearly thought out the distinctions he is endeavouring to make still however the fact remains that in the de orations he does not allow prayer as he defines it to be offered to christ but to the father only and it is this limitation chiefly that caused the treatise to be under a cloud and added yet another reason for holding its author suspect the point obviously raises the whole question of origen's doctrine of god upon which i suppose the last word will never be said the matter is further complicated by the fact that often we cannot be at all certain what origen actually did write for many of his works are extant only in the latin translation of rufinus who is notoriously and admittedly unreliable as a translator it cannot be doubted that he frequently altered origen's language in a more orthodox direction i have showed that he did this also with some phrases of eusebius of a doubtful theological character 31 hence only those passages of origen of which the original greek is extant can be safely trusted to give his meaning but it is not difficult to see that origen's language w acts 7 60 28 xiv 2 29 h ab 3 1 2 lxx 30 j onah 2 1 2 3 31 j.r xxx 153 156 on prayer 189 concerning the relation of the son or the word to the father must fail to be satisfactory from an orthodox point of view origen started from the conception of an absolutely trans cendent god god is intelligence simple invisible incorporeal or even beyond intelligence and being substance and cannot be comprehended save by him who was after the image of his intelligence 32 god is above truth wisdom light 33 and even above eternal life 34 elsewhere 35 origen discusses whether god is not also beyond substance and leans to the conclusion that he is for we cannot say that he partakes of substance rather he causes all beings the logos included to partake of it 36 on these premisses such a conception as that of the logos was essential on the one hand if revelation were to become pos sible for man and on the other it was very difficult in relating the logos or son for the terms for origen are interchangeable to god to maintain their co equality in fact origen postulates a real subordinationism and the logical outcome of it all is seen in the present passage in which he teaches that prayer is to be directed to the father alone in respect of this matter two extreme attitudes towards origen have been taken in later times some have aimed at establishing his orthodoxy in the terms of the nicene faith labouring in the effort to explain or explain away everything that seems to point in the opposite direction and such defenders have also brought to their aid the works of origen known only in the latin translation of rufinus although it is certain that rufinus made them appear more orthodox than they really were the opposite school has roundly accused origen of heresy both of these have forgotten that origen was the child of his environment and of his age his philosophic background at alexandria provided him with a conception of god into which it was very difficult if not impossible to fit a doctrine of the essential trinity and secondly origen lived before the con troversies and the great conciliar decisions of the fourth and fifth centuries had given formal expression to the catholic faith at the begining of the third century thought was fluid on these matters in his endeavour to systematize and state christian theology origen was a pioneer and made the mistakes of a pioneer especially as he was a daring pioneer many of his speculations 32 contra celsum vii 38 33 i n j h ii 23 18 34 ibid xiii 3 35 contra celsum vi 64 3 de faye iii 31 32 190 origen were simply speculations upon which the church has not pro nounced an opinion and we may let them pass in other mat ters including the doctrine in question origen failed to reach the position which was afterwards seen to be orthodox but origen never intended heresy or to set his opinions against those of the church 37 eusebius tells us that when only seventeen or thereabouts origen could not be persuaded to associate in prayer with a certain heretic named paul keeping the rule of the church even from boyhood and loathing the very word he himself uses somewhere the teachings of the heretics and it is interesting to note that to go no further than this present treatise origen refers to heretics and heretical teaching in a way that betrays no sympathy with them or it but very much the contrary and he certainly would have been distressed be yond measure had he been told that one day he would be classed among them for example in xxii 3 he speaks of numbers of heretics who for their own purposes say jesus is lord in xxiv 5 he refers to the most impious conceptions and godless thought contained in tatian's interpretation of let there be light in xxix 10 we have a vigorous passage denouncing those who misinterpreting the scriptures fall into error concerning the son and the father in xxix 13 we have a clear reference to the marcionites who have imagined a god other than the creator of heaven and earth because they find many such things in the law and the prophets and have taken offence against him as not good who utters such senti ments and lastly when in v i he is dealing with objections to prayer he roundly denounces those who reject prayer com pletely as downright atheists who deny the existence of god or else as people who go as far as to accept the name of god but do away with his providence these passages make it clear that origen was definitely on the side of orthodoxy as he con ceived it moreover origen was essentially a biblical theologian and his subordinationism sprang not only from his conception of deity but also from what he conceived the scriptures to teach texts that he quoted for this purpose were the father is greater than i john 14 28 that they should know thee the only true god john 17 3 why callest thou me good mark 10 18 and especially i cor 15 28 and when all things have been subjected unto him then shall the son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him 1,2 14 on prayer iqi that god may be all in all 38 similarly in support of prayer to god alone he turns to scripture 39 if prayer is to be offered to the father it is to be offered in the name of christ as taught in john 16 23 24 christ is the high priest heb 2 17 etc and therefore prayer is not offered apart from him christ is also the brother of those who pray heb 2 12 and it is not reasonable that those who have been deemed worthy to have one father should pray to a brother 40 it is not suggested that origen always drew the correct conclusions from these passages but it is clear that he wrestled with scripture as concerning the rela tionship of the son to the father and that he believed that he had extracted its true meaning the moral to be drawn from the whole controversy is that though origen failed to satisfy catholic orthodoxy as it was expressed later it still remains to examine scripture more closely in order to discover from it such an exegesis as is consistent with the doctrine of the essential trinity origen s mistakes will not have been in vain if they lead us to a fresh investigation of this matter the second point which threw suspicion on the orthodoxy of the treatise on prayer is one which will not cause us so much concern today in xxxi 3 origen says that it has been shown by those who have treated of the matter that the bodies of heavenly beings are spherical the sources from which he drew this conclusion are given elsewhere 41 the modern church may be disposed to receive such a notion with humorous indulgence but it was not so in earlier times when origenistic controversies waxed hotly 42 as we shall see the emperor justinian included this opinion among the nine tenets for which he anathematized origen and it is also to be found among the fifteen anathemas against origen which though not properly part of the pro ceedings of the fifth general council contain contemporaneous matter discussed and circulated at that time the opinion therefore that heavenly bodies are spherical severely damaged the treatise in orthodox eyes especially as origen goes so far as to say that the opinion had been demonstrated 43 no doubt opposition to the notion was bound up with a literalistic con ception of the resurrection of the body or flesh which prevailed in the early church and as origen was supposed to be unsound on this matter generally the particular fancy concerning the sphericity of celestial bodies was fastened on by his opponents in an age when orthodoxy and dogmatism were often confused 38 cf xxv 2 39 xv i 2 40 xv 4 41 see pp 381 382 42 see p 232 43 the word he uses is origen characteristic ideas of origen in the de oratione besides the two particular ideas mentioned above the treatise on prayer also contains much of origen's characteristic outlook i relation between body and soul seen and unseen earthly and heavenly idealist the whole thought of origen is dorni ofthe inferiority of the materialand visiblelijf compared with the immaterial and invisible and con sequently by the dualis unvolved in this outlook character istically at the outset of the treatise 44 he quotes the words of wisdom of solomon 9 15 a corruptible body weigheth down the soul and the earthy frame lieth heavy on a mind that is full of cares and he speaks of the human mind as still imprisoned in the body 45 the same conviction appears also under various forms in his treatment of the supposed saying of the lord ask for the great things and the little things shall be added unto you ask for the heavenly things and the earthly things shall be added unto you 46 he invariably interprets the great and heavenly things as spiritual blessings the little and earthly things as material blessings it is clear he says 47 that all symbolical and typical things are e smalt and earthly in comparison with the true and spiritual things it is thus that we are to interpret passages in the old testament which speak of the saints there as requesting material blessings in all likeli hood the divine word indicates the heavenly 5 and great things by means of matters connected with earthly and little things saying to us ye who desire to be spiritual ask in prayer so that having received them as heavenly ye may inherit the kingdom of heaven and as great ye may enjoy the greatest blessings but the earthly and little things of which ye are in want for bodily necessities the father will supply unto you in accordance with the measure of your need in accordance with this principle hannah hezekiah judith jonah and the three holy children although holy scripture speaks of them as having received earthly benefits or deliver ance received in reality spiritual blessings which far outweighed the former 48 we can obtain today such spiritual blessings as the 44 i i 45 xvii 2 4 ii s 47 xiv i 48 xvi 3 on prayer 193 old testament spoke of in type 49 earthly blessings are indeed only the shadow of spiritual blessings and just as the sun may not cast a shadow at all in certain circumstances and at certain latitudes so some spiritual blessings are accompanied by no earthly blessing 50 those on earth are hampered by certain im pressions arising from attendant circumstances and so have a tendency to follow the worse course but this is not so with those in heaven who possess a soul that is perfected by reason and alien to the influence of these impressions and make use of a body that is ethereal and absolutely pure 51 one of the benefits of prayer for us is that the eyes of the understanding are lifted up away from converse with earthly things and occupation with material impressions and therefore they can transcend created things 52 and finally this principle governs entirely origen's exegesis of give us this day our daily bread 53 as we shall see when we come to consider his exposition of the lord's prayer clause by clause the bread that origen would have us pray for is no material substance 54 origen appears to indicate the philosophical basis of his conviction concerning the in feriority of material things in ch xxi 2 no material or bodily thing is single but every one of them though reckoned single is split up and cut in pieces and divided into several parts having lost its unity and since in accordance with greek belief virtue is one vice is many therefore the multi plex character of material things demonstrates this imperfec tion consistently with his general position origen quotes 55 from ignatius 56 with approval the saying nothing that is seen is good but origen nor yet ignatius did not push this state ment to its logical conclusion just as ignatius vigorously asserts in reply to gnostic error the reality of the eucharist so origen 57 attacks those who completely reject objects of sense and use neither baptism nor eucharist such persons according to him are influenced by the persuasions of satan 2 immateriality of god this follows from the foregoing it was one of origen s firmest beliefs and duly finds a place in this treatise especially in ch xxiii in connection with the words which art in heaven when the father of the saints is said to be in heaven we are 49 xiii 3 4 5 so xvii i 2 5i ch vii 52 ix 2 53 ch xxvii 54 see pp 212 218 361 fil 55 xx 2 56 romans 3 5 v i a.c 13 194 origen not to suppose that he is circumscribed in bodily fashion and dwells in heaven otherwise if the heaven contained him god would be found less than because contained by the heaven but we must believe that by the ineffable power of his godhead all things are contained and held together by him simple folk however take in a literal sense phrases in scripture which seem to assert that god is in a place and such passages must be given their true meaning thus for example when in st john's gospel the lord speaks of departing out of this world to the father 3 of coming forth from god and going to god and so forth and of the father and the son coming unto the believer and making our abode with him 55 these sayings according to origen do not conceive of a local departure of the father and the son to him who loves the word of jesus nor are they to be taken in a local sense similarly the words at the end of the same gospel touch me not for i am not yet ascended to the father are to be taken in a mystical sense as an ascent of the mind rather than of the body again we cannot take literally the passage gen 3 8 which speaks of the lord god walking in the garden is a literal garden so much larger than god that it contains him as he walks in it we are rather to compare the passage i will dwell in them and walk in them ii cor 6 16 god's walking in the garden is of the same kind as his walking in the saints and on the other hand every sinner like adam and eve hides himself from the presence of god avoids his visitation and shuns open speech with him just as gain went out from the presence of god gen 4 16 again in ch xxv origen teaches that the kingdom of god is im manent and spiritual the saviour says luke 17 20 21 the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or lo there but the kingdom of god is within you and to this origen adds the saying in deuteronomy 30 14 for the word is very nigh in thy mouth and in thy heart this is comparable to the saying quoted above we will come unto him and make our abode with him every saint who takes god as his king and obeys the spiritual laws of god dwells in himself as in a well ordered city by god's king dom is meant the blessed state of the reason and the ordered condition of wise thoughts 58 58 sec further pp 216 ff on prayer 195 3 angels heavenly powers and departed saints it is not surprising that origen for whom the unseen world was the great reality should give the place he does to the ministry of angels and of those who have passed within the veil chapter xi is devoted to this thought angels ministered to jesus when he was on earth and no doubt they still minister to him as he carries out his work for the salvation of men more over scripture speaks of the angels in heaven rejoicing over the sinner that repenteth and of the ministry of raphael as re corded in the book of tobit in helping forward the prayers of tobit and sarah so according to origen we may assume that angels who watch over things and minister to god are at times brought into the presence of this or that man who is praying in order that they may join in his requests each one's guardian angel also joins in our prayers and gives us his aid with regard to the ministry of departed saints origen's line of thought is as follows love to one's neighbour we are taught in god's word is one of the chiefest virtues care for the mem bers of the body the church is a mark of that love and it is not only by those in this life that such love is exercised rather we must hold that the saints who have fallen asleep before us exercise it towards those who are struggling in this life much more than do they who are compassed about with human weak ness and are struggling in company with feebler folk similar thoughts are to be found in ch xxxi 5 6 7 only here it is not a question of the individual and his need of assistance but of the church when assembled for worship on such occasions there is an invisible as well as a visible company present each worshipper's guardian angel is there to help him whom he is charged to guard so that there is a double church the one of men the other of angels and there are present also the spirits of those who are fallen asleep the spot therefore where believers come together in one place has a peculiar sacredness there is a power not of this world but derived from things invisible present to that assembly which is not to the same extent to be found in prayer offered by the individual believer 4 evil spiritual powers belief in evil spiritual powers is correlative to the foregoing and like it is based on scriptural language with paul origen is convinced that our wrestling is not against flesh and blood 196 origen but against the principalities against the powers against the world rulers of this darkness against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places 59 in xxvi 3 he takes up the concluding words in this sentence why are we told to pray thy will be done as in heaven so on earth if in heaven there are these malevolent powers opposed to the will of god an answer to this is put forward in xxvi 5 6 the mind is its own place he who has his citizenship in heaven though literally on earth is no longer of the earth but of heaven and the heavenly world similarly the spiritual hosts of wickedness that still reside in the heavenly places have their citizenship on earth and because of their evil disposition dwell no longer in heaven for they have fallen in mind with him who fell from heaven after the manner of lightning again just as in an assembly of christians for worship there is a twofold company of holy men and of blessed angels so there may be also in such an assembly a double gathering of a different sort of wicked men and of bad angels for church assemblies are not entirely composed of men genuinely devoted to god but also it may be include some who have given themselves up to angels of the devil through their sins and wicked disregard of god 60 finally origen finds no difficulty in the concluding words of the lord's prayer deliver us from the evil one the presence and power of a personal devil was well within the content of his beliefs he finds scriptural warrant for it in the account of the temptations of job and those of the saviour and in the words of paul al ready quoted the fiery darts of the evil one 5 ascetic view of life that origen lived a disciplined and ascetic life is plainly stated for us by eusebius 61 at any rate in his earlier days he continued to live like a philosopher putting aside everything that might lead to youthful lusts all day long his discipline was to perform labours of no light character and the greater part of the night he devoted himself to studying the divine scriptures and he persevered as far as possible in the most philosophic manner of life at one time disciplining himself by fasting at an other measuring out the time for sleep which he was careful to take never on a couch but on the floor he is said for ex ample to have walked for many years without using a shoe of any description yea more to have refrained for a great many 59 eph 6 12 o xxxi 6 h.e 9 vi 3 9 12 on prayer 197 years from the use of wine and all except necessary food so that he actually incurred the risk of undermining and destroying his constitution the treatise on prayer though not concerned with prescrib ing any particular mode of life is entirely consistent with the description of its author as given by eusebius it is the work of a man for whom as we have pointed out above the body and bodily things held a negligible place the conviction that the life of the spirit is everything is expressed in an eloquent passage in xvii i if spiritual things are present to us and we are being enlightened by god in the complete possession of what is truly good we shall not waste words about the paltry thing that is the shadow for all material and bodily things of what ever kind they may be have the value of an unsubstantial and feeble shadow and can in no way be compared with the saving and holy gifts of the god of the universe what sort of com parison can there be between bodily riches and the riches in all utterance and in all wisdom who that is not a madman would compare health of flesh and bones with a healthy mind and a robust soul and a balanced reason again in ch xxix on bring us not into temptation life is depicted as what keats calls a vale of soul making the whole of human life upon earth is a temptation no one can escape from this discipline rich or poor high or low healthy or sick in this way god in his mercy shows us our weakness that we may discover his power and gives us satiety of sin that we may be purified and come to hate what we formerly desired and retrace the path towards holiness even when temptation is not present in the times between successive temptations we ought to take a firm stand against what is impending and prepare ourselves for anything that may possibly happen so that whatever it may be we shall not be proved unready but shall be made manifest to have dis ciplined ourselves with the utmost care 62 in addition to this general teaching there are also a few particular references which indicate the ascetic trend of origen's mind prayer as we ought is hindered unless in the performance of the ineffable mysteries of marriage due regard is paid to gravity infrequency and the absence of passion 63 it is a question whether it is a holy and pure thing to intercede with god in the place where sexual intercourse occurs i do not mean unlawful intercourse but that which is allowed by the apostolic word c by way of per mission not of commandment 3 for if it is not possible to give 62 xxix 19 63 ii 2 ig8 origen oneself to prayer as one ought unless given over to it by consent for a season perhaps the same consideration should be applied if possible to the place 64 he who has perceived what the beauty of the heavenly bride and bridegroom is will be ashamed to honour even with the same name of beauty the bodily beauty of woman or boy or man flesh does not contain beauty in the true sense of the word seeing that all of it is shameful 65 but a more modest expression of self control is found in xxviii 2 we are debtors in what we owe to ourselves in so using the body that we do not waste its strength through love of pleasure 6 allegory speaking of the treatise on prayer westcott 66 says that no writing of origen is more free from his characteristic faults and if we count excessive allegorism as one of these this opinion can be endorsed for as compared with most of his other works he here indulges to a far less degree his flights of exegetical fancy this is no doubt partly due to the fact that he is treating a subject not commenting directly upon a biblical text occa sionally however in this treatise he betrays his penchant for this kind of thing in xxvi 3 in the petition thy will be done as in heaven so on earth heaven and earth are allegorized as christ and the church respectively the text in pro verbs 15 17 better a dinner of herbs where friendship and grace are than a stalled ox and hatred therewith is interpreted as follows the simple minded christian who cannot receive the stronger and more important points of doctrine is to be pre ferred to him who though more skilful and quick sighted yet fails to see clearly what concerns the peace and harmony of the whole and indulges in high flown words exalted against the knowledge of god 67 when the three men turned in and lodged with abraham and partook of food with him gen 18 2 6 perhaps this is to be taken quite figuratively for the saints are able to partake on occasion of spirtual and reasonable food with diviner powers and the angels in turn are glad and nour ished therewith and co operate the more readily with him who nourishes them with the nutriment of teachings formerly pre pared 68 the exegesis of the dragon and the ethiopians in ps 73 i 3 h lxx and of peter's vision in acts ch 10 may also be referred to as curiosities 69 in xxvii 14 origen does 64 xxxi 4 65 xvii 2 66 d.c.b iv 124 67 xxvii 6 68 xxvii 1 1 69 xxvii 12 on prayer not doubt that there are hidden meanings connected with cer tain jewish ordinances such as the feast of the seven weeks and of the seventh month and with the seven years of the freedom of the hebrew servants and with the jubile and so forth but these are part of the father's unsearchable judgments and his ways past finding out and are known only to the mind of christ who has contemplated the father's will concerning his ordinances in all ages a similar thought that the inner mysteries underlying certain ordinances are things beyond man in this life appears again afterwards in xxvii 16 but origen's most characteristic effort in the matter of exegesis in this treatise is to be found in xxix 9 according to the lxx of canticles 2 9 10 the beloved is to be found glancing through the meshes he sheweth himself through the lattice 3 revised version the beloved is of course the saviour the meshes are the meshes of temptation which the saviour entered for the sake of those who were caught in them aforetime he now promises deliverance to his bride the church when he says rise up come my near one my fair one my dove on the other hand origen occasionally manifests a strange almost grotesque literalism in expounding words of scripture as for example in vii i when he argues that the sun and moon have a certain free will because the psalmist says praise ye him sun and moon 7 different grades of hearers one of origen's most frequently expressed opinions is that there are two classes of christians the less mature and the more mature to whom respectively teaching must be adapted accord ing to their spiritual capacity to receive it this idea he derived ultimately from the new testament 70 and he found it suited admirably his style of biblical interpretation the babes in christ could receive and understand the plain literal meaning of scripture but the inner allegorical meaning could be im parted only to those who were spiritually fullgrown this idea finds its place in the treatise on prayer as in all his writings in ii 4 he suggests that even john the baptist observed such a distinction imparting certain teaching about prayer to some only of his followers simple folk 71 when they read our father which art in heaven imagine that god is in a place whereas this and other passages open to a like misinterpretation 70 i cor 3 2 heb 5 13 14 cf i cor 2 6 i xxiii i 20o origen must be taken in a loftier and more spiritual sense 72 the discussion on the daily bread also gives origen ample opportunity to express the idea of classes of hearers the word which nourishes us is varied and diverse for not all are able to be nourished with the solidity and vigorous force of the divine teachings 73 those who are more perfect when they read of bread will understand it of the bread which came down out of heaven not as the fathers did eat and died then origen goes on to quote i cor 3 1 3 and heb 5 12 14 and in their light to interpret rom 14 2 one man hath faith to eat all things but he that is weak eateth herbs this saying is not principally concerned with bodily nourishment but rather with the words of god that nourish the soul the stronger man is able to partake of all teachings the weaker and less per fect is content with simpler instruction a similar thought is found in xxvii 9 when the word of god is given either as milk suitably for babes or as herbs suitably for them that are weak or as flesh seasonably for those who are contesting each of those who are nourished in proportion as he has offered himself to the word can accomplish this or that thing or be comes such or such a person on the other hand in another passage in this context origen betrays an anxiety based no doubt upon experience that dangers may lurk for those who pursue such higher interpreta tions for they may give rise to high flown words proclaiming a doctrine foreign to the father of our lord jesus who has given the law and the prophets the followers of marcion seem to be intended and this is indicated in prov 15 17 better a dinner of herbs where friendship and grace are i.e simpler teachings than a stalled ox and hatred therewith i.e heretical presumptions 8 free will that man and all creatures of reason possess free will is a fundamental point in origen's whole theological system and is affirmed in all his writings 74 he believed in a pre mundane fall that is to say that in the transcendent world a conscious act of will on the part of spiritual beings took place whereby they fell from their high estate and further that the return to god in the case of such beings will be achieved also by an act of free will moreover since for origen the action of god upon 72 xxiii 5 73 xxvii 4 74 dc faye iii 214 on prayer 201 human souls in respect of their redemption and uplift is always educative and disciplinary it follows that god must have free creatures to respond to such education it is not surprising then that when origen is discussing the difficulties concerning prayer which his friends had brought to his notice see p 250 he should place in the forefront his reasons for believing in free will 75 these will be examined later on in this volume 76 towards the end of the treatise 77 the same conviction receives characteristic expression i verily believe that god orders every rational soul with a view to its eternal life and that it always maintains its free will and of its own motion either mounts ever higher and higher until it reaches the pinnacle of virtue or on the contrary descends through carelessness to this or that excess of wickedness then in this latter case after being glutted with sin men may hate what they formerly wel comed and so when they are healed they can possess more securely the health that comes to their souls by being healed in xxix 15 we are told that god does not wish that good should come to anyone as of necessity but of free will 9 universalism there are only a few allusions to this doctrine in the treatise in xxvii 15 origen says that in the ages to come god will shew the riches of his grace in kindness 5 78 when the greatest sinner who has spoken ill of the holy spirit and is under the power of sin throughout the present age will i know not how be under treatment from beginning to end in the ensuing age that is to come it is implied that this treatment will be suc cessful purification after this life is over is referred to in xxix 14 and in the following section the cleansing of even the most reprobate sinners 10 church ordinances and worship as a general rule origen has little to say about these in his writings and the present treatise is no exception the greater part of which is concerned with private individual prayer to god here and there however there are a few references to the visible order of the church in v i origen when roundly de nouncing certain persons who think that they ought not to pray says that the champions of this opinion which origen 75 chs vi viii i 76 see pp 336 ffi 77 xxix 13 78 eph 2 7 202 origen attributes to the evil one are those who completely reject objects of sense and use neither baptism nor eucharist in xv 4 he speaks of those who have received through re generation the spirit of adoption that they may be called sons of god but the reference to baptism is not actually made explicit in xxviii 4 origen speaks of the responsibilities of the several orders of ministers there is a certain debt due from a deacon and another from a presbyter but the debt due from a bishop is the heaviest since it is demanded of him by the saviour of the whole church and retribution follows if it be not paid later on in the same chapter sections 9 and 10 occurs the passage to which reference is made elsewhere 79 about priestly absolution chapter xxxi 5 7 is the only passage that treats of prayer in the public assembly of the church in this origen touches on the superiority of public over private prayer as arising from the probability that in the former there are also present invisible angelic powers and spirits of departed church members not to speak of the power of the lord and saviour himself but the passage throws no light upon the nature of the worship or the order of service analysis of the treatise introduction chapters i and ii what is impossible for man alone is made possible by the grace of god in christ paul who says that we know not what we ought to pray for as we ought also says

pray chapter xxxi 4 7 the superiority of prayer towards the east chapter xxxii the subjects of prayer chapter xxxiii conclusion chapter xxxiv 206 origen origen's conception of prayer in general the theological starting point in origen's treatment of the subject of prayer is to be found in the absolute transcendence of god and the impossibility that man can know him or his will unaided 80 what man shall know the counsel of god or who shall conceive what the lord willeth hardly do we divine the things that are on earth but the things that are in the heavens who ever traced out 81 of ourselves therefore we do not know what we ought to say when we pray or how we should dispose ourselves to pray but revelation has come to our assistance the scriptures tell us what we ought to pray about and how we ought to pray more particularly there is the passage which declares that the spirit himself maketh intercession to god on our behalf as we address ourselves to prayer 82 and origen also recalls how one of christ's disciples recognizing his human weakness and ignorance in the matter of prayer said to the master lord teach us to pray 83 therefore as he begins his difficult task origen knows that he needs the illumination of the father the teaching of the first begotten word and the operation of the spirit if he is to treat worthily so weighty a matter and accordingly he opens with a prayer that he may be able to speak rightly about prayer and to interpret rightly the prayers that are recorded in the gospels 84 this introduction displays at the outset what is the outstand ing feature of the treatise on prayer and of all origen's works namely their unvarying biblical character no one else in the early church had so intimate and profound a knowledge of holy scripture or was so unremitting in using it as the basis of all his teaching it is not surprising therefore that with this strong biblical background origen should go on to speak of some of the words used for prayer in the greek bible old and new testaments in point of fact however this is the least valuable part of the treatise the discussion in chs ill and iv on the words euche and proseuche fails to throw much light on the difference between them the passage seems to have been hastily composed and to be based upon reminiscences of certain texts rather than on a careful study of the terms in question 85 of greater value is origen's discussion in xiv 2 5 of the four words used in i tim 2 1 namely supplication seyms prayer irpoaevxtf intercession iarreu s and thanks 80 i i 81 wisdom of solomon 9 13 16 82 rom 8 26 27 luke 1 1 1 ii 6 85 see note p 334 on prayer 207 giving wxapurrta he notes correctly that supplication 5 is a petition offered for the obtaining of some particular thing and that evrev s which does not necessarily mean what the english word intercession does prayer in relation to others involves the notion of a free or bold approach to god intercession he says is a request to god for certain things made by one who possesses more than usual confidence origen also notes the fact that prayer trpoo eu tj is a word reserved for address to god whereas the other three supplica tion intercession thanksgiving may not unsuitably be addressed to holy men also but prayer according to origen is not simply asking god for something nor are its benefits to be confined to the obtaining of what we ask for on this point he is insistent and indeed some of the most eloquent sentences in the treatise are devoted to expressing it great benefit he says results simply from a proper disposition or preparation for prayer without doubt he whose mind is set on prayer is in some measure profited merely by the settled condition involved in praying when he has disposed himself to approach god and speak in his presence as to one who watches over him and is present 86 the greatest benefits re sult from the attitude of and preparation for prayer considered simply by themselves of the man who has dedicated himself to god 87 the calling to mind of a wise and famous man may check evil impulses and stir up to emulation how much more profitable is it to recollect god in whom we have put our trust who knows the secrets of our heart and is present with us 88 and not only in the mere disposition for prayer is there a looking up to god there is also a looking away from earthly things and bodily impressions quoting the words of the psalm ists unto thee have i lifted up mine eyes o thou that dwellest in the heaven 89 and unto thee have i lifted up my soul o god 90 origen go es on to say when the eyes of the under standing are lifted up away from converse with earthly things and occupation with material impressions and when they are elevated so high that they can transcend created things and fix themselves solely upon the contemplation of god and of reverent and seemly intercourse with him who hears it must needs be that the eyes themselves derive the greatest benefit when with unveiled face they reflect as in a mirror the glory of the lord and are transformed into the same image from glory to glory 91 86 viii 2 87 ix 2 88 viil 2 9 ps 123 1 90 p s 25 1 91 ii cor 3 18 208 origen moreover when the soul is lighted up and follows the spirit and severs itself from the body it must needs be that laying aside the nature of a soul it becomes spiritual 92 he who prays must follow the precept of christ 93 and enter into his own inner chamber shutting himself in upon the riches laid up in store the treasures of wisdom and knowledge 94 he must never bend outside or gape at the things outside but shut every door of the faculties of sense so that he may not be enticed by the im pressions of sense and their image may not penetrate into his mind 95 but the mind of him who sets himself to pray has not merely to be free from sense impressions he must also put away all angry or licentious thoughts 96 he must bear no malice or hatred in his heart thus he will observe the commandment of the saviour when he says if ye stand praying forgive if ye have aught against anyone 97 by such preparation for prayer it is clear that we have already obtained the greatest benefits and further he must not approach god in prayer with a heart that is secretly discontented grumbling against providence and murmuring at its lot those who do this are like wicked servants who though they do not openly cavil at their master's orders nevertheless among themselves mutter their displeasure at them we are warned against this sort of thing in deuteronomy 98 in the saying beware that there be not a hidden word in thine heart a lawless thing on the other hand it is written of one who was sorely tempted by the trials of life to murmur 99 in all these happenings did not job sin with his lips before god this emphasis upon contemplation of god apart from peti tion and its benefits to the soul is characteristic of one aspect the mystical side of origen which has been recently the object of numerous studies 1 by its means he says by this mental catharsis he who prays becomes more capable of union with god and participates in the prayer of our advocate the word of god who stands in the midst even of those who know him not and never fails the prayer of anyone 2 no doubt for origen it was a stage on the way towards the heavenly vision the epopteia of the mysteries which was and is the goal of all mystical aspiration but it would be a complete mistake to suppose that origen is unpractical and merely visionary in his treatment of the subject of prayer quite the contrary it has been said that 92 ix 2 matt 6 6 94 col 2 3 95 xx 2 96 ix i 97 mark 11 25 98 deut 15 9 99 j o b 2 10 i cf j danieiou origin 287 f 2 x 2 on prayer 20g mystics are among the most practical of people and origen appears to be an example of this fact if it be a fact for few writers have more definitely connected prayer with life the vision of god with daily work than he has in this treatise he discusses 3 the meaning of paul's command pray without ceasing 4 and it is to be noted that he makes no attempt to evade the difficulty evolved in it actual prayer he says ought to be engaged in not less than three times every day citing the examples of daniel 5 and peter 6 and referring to relevant pas sages in the psalms we can however regard pray without ceasing as a practicable saying if we include the performance of good deeds and the fulfilling of commandments as part of the prayer that man prays without ceasing 5 who combines with the prayer the needful deeds and the prayer with the fitting actions in other words prayer and action based on it are not to be regarded as two things but as one joined indissolubly to gether thus we can speak of the whole life of the saint as one great unbroken prayer no other saying about prayer links up prayer so closely with practical duties it is not as if we said labor are est or are or or are est labor are as if the one could be regarded as an equivalent substitute for the other but rather that both form part of a connected whole nor is it a saying which strives to balance the two sides of the christian life the devotional and the practical and secure a fitting proportion between them its purpose is rather to infuse new meaning into each of them when it is shown that they are so interrelated as to form an integrated whole later on in the treatise 7 in speaking about the opening words of the lord's prayer he returns to this thought which was evidently for him no passing phrase do not let us think he says that we are taught to say actual words at a certain fixed time of prayer if we understand what has been said above in our discussion about praying without ceasing our whole life as we pray without ceasing 8 shall say our father which art in heaven 3 9 its citizenship shall in no wise be on earth but in every way in heaven 10 which is the throne 11 of god for the kingdom of heaven is seated in all those who bear the image of the heavenly 12 and are therefore themselves heavenly origen's treatment of the practical benefits to be derived 3 xii 2 4 i thess 5 17 s dan 6 10 6 acts 10 9 11 7 xxii 5 i thess 5 17 9 matt 6 9 10 phil 3 20 cf isa 66 1 12 i cor 15 49 a.c 14 210 origen from prayer as apart from its contemplative side is enriched and fortified by the examples he gives from the bible of the per sonal advantages of prayer in xiii 2 he names for example hannah hezekiah mordecai and esther judith the three holy children and jonah in all these cases the results of prayer were manifest and notable and he prefaces them by reference to the supreme example 13 jesus who prayed and did not pray in vain obtaining what he asked for and on one occa sion testifying to the father i knew that thou hearest me always 14 if as we have noted 15 origen begins his treatise with the thought of an absolutely transcendent god he certainly does not leave us baffled and helpless when faced with god's awful remoteness origen for all his transcendence was no deist it is indeed rather from the intellectual aspect that he speaks of the vast gulf that separates god from men unaided man can in no wise apprehend divine wisdom but his doctrine of revela tion is as clear and unhesitating as his doctrine of transcendence what is impossible for man alone becomes possible through the grace of our lord jesus christ and his holy spirit 16 through these channels mediation illumination grace stream down from him who is above all so it is that origen's doctrine of prayer and its benefits is warm rich and personal to reject prayer he says is the tenet either of those who are downright atheists and deny the existence of god or else of those who go as far as to accept the name of god but do away with provi dence 7 on the other hand the prayers commended by him are the prayers of those who are confident in themselves that they stand before and speak to god as one who is present and hears 18 it is evident that origen was touched to the quick by the opinions subversive of prayer which his friends had com municated to him 19 and this was so because origen the intel lectualist the critic the speculator was also origen the mystic the devoted disciple and the practical christian the latter aspect of him is naturally enough prominent in this treatise which for this reason is indispensable if we are to form a balanced view of the man as a whole where origen falls short of the richness of bible teaching about prayer is in connection with the range of things for which the christian ought to pray as a platonist he is convinced con cerning the inferiority of the material world it is shadowy un 13 xiii u 14 john 11 42 15 p 330 i i i v i is viii 2 19 see pp 247 250 on prayer 211 substantial and of small account as compared with the true substantial and abiding invisible realities consequently the things that we can see hear and touch with the bodily senses indeed the whole life of the body are comparatively of little moment and when we approach the invisible god in prayer it is not for these bodily things that we are to pray but for the spiritual only as we have noted elsewhere 20 it is thus that origen interprets the saying traditionally supposed to come from the lord ask for the great things and the little things shall be added to you and ask for the heavenly things and the earthly things shall be added unto you 21 the little and earthly things being of course the things of the body accordingly earnest seekers after spiritual life in christ should turn away from prayer for trivial and earthly things and pursue instead things mystical of which the aforesaid are types 22 the old testament indeed tells of material benefits bestowed upon the saints in answer to their prayers but these only foreshadow the greater immaterial blessings that flow under the new covenant to the christian through prayer if hannah in her barrenness was given a child in answer to her prayer 23 so also souls that have long been sterile perceiving the barrenness of their own reason and the sterility of their own mind have by the holy spirit through persistent prayer con ceived and given birth to saving words 24 similarly the deliverances from bodily dangers and death vouchsafed to hezekiah esther judith the three holy children and jonah are but types of deliverances today from the spiritual hosts of wickedness it is on these lines that in xvi 2 origen answers an objection that may be made to his treatment of this matter namely that the bible tells of things pertaining to the body as being granted to prayer and the saviour speaks of such things as being added unto us take an illustration he says from ordinary life if some one were to give us a bodily object of any kind whatsoever we should not say that such a one bestowed upon us the shadow of the bodily object for in giving the bodily object he did not design to give two things the object and its shadow but the design of the giver was to give the bodily ob ject it followed however that with the gift of the object we also received its shadow similarly when our understanding has grown in stature and we note what are the gifts which are pre eminently given us by god we shall say that bodily things are 20 pp 331 f 21 ii 2 22 xiii 4 23 xiii 2 24 xiii 3 212 origen the most natural accompaniments of the great and heavenly gifts in xvii i origen continues the same line of thought and this time employs an illustration from the sun dial in some latitudes and seasons he says the gnomon of the dial casts no shadow this causes no concern to the man who rejoices in the sunlight if a man who seeks the rays of the sun has this indis pensable thing he is neither rejoiced nor grieved by the presence or absence of bodily shadows so also if spiritual things are present to us and we are being enlightened by god in the com plete possession of what is truly good we shall not waste words about the paltry thing that is the shadow for all material and bodily things of whatever kind they may be have the value of an unsubstantial and feeble shadow and can in no way be compared with the saving and holy gifts of the god of the universe likewise the petitionary part of the model prayer outlined in xxxiii i is to be concerned with great and heavenly things this point of view is carried by origen to its logical conclu sion in his treatment of the petition give us this day our daily bread 25 some suppose he says that we are told to pray con cerning material bread but the opinion is false and must be refuted the lord who has taught us elsewhere to pray for great and heavenly things cannot forget here his own teaching and command us to ask the father for a small and earthly thing the true interpretation according to origen is along the lines of certain sayings in john ch 6 as for example work not for the meat which perisheth but for the meat which abideth unto eternal life 26 this spiritualizing of what seems on the face of it to be a petition for bodily sustenance is comparable with clement of alexandria's treatment of the riches which the young man in the gospels was told to give up so with regard to the rich who shall hardly enter the kingdom we must understand the word in the spirit of disciples and not clumsily rudely or literally for it is not spoken thus 27 both passages illustrate the weakness of the alexandrines in the lengths to which they will push their interpretation of scripture in the interests of their philosophy of life towards the end of the treatise origen turns to particulars concerning the posture and the subjects of prayer when we are praying he says that attitude in which the hands are stretched out and eyes lifted up is to be preferred to all others 28 this 2 xxvii i 2 s john 6 27 27 qjus dives 18 23 xxxi 2 on prayer 213 is an image of the qualities suitable to the soul and mind by virtue of which the soul is intent upon its object and the mind directed to god standing which origen assumes to be the normal posture in prayer is also a symbol signifying that the reason is not earth bound but lifted up towards the lord of all there is however a kind of prayer which demands that we should kneel 29 when one is about to accuse oneself of his sins before god supplicating him for healing therefrom and for for giveness thereof then kneeling is a symbol of the man who is abject and submissive but it is not clear if this refers to a parti cular prayer of an especially penitentiary character or to the penitential part of the model prayer that he outlines later on 30 in praying we should turn towards the east 31 it is the quarter in which the sun rises therefore prayer in that direction is sym bolical of the soul looking to the rising of the true light prayer says origen ought to fall into four parts according to subject 30 first in the beginning or preamble god is to be glorified through christ in the holy spirit next comes thanks giving both general and particular in the third place comes confession of sin followed by prayer for deliverance from the habit of sin and for forgiveness of the past in the fourth place he who prays should add his request for great and heavenly things his own and general and also for his family and his dearest finally the prayer should end as it began by glori fying god through christ in the holy spirit characteristically origen bases these subjects of prayer on holy scripture and gives examples therefrom of each of the four subjects origen's treatment of the lord's prayer chapters xviii to xxx as a textual scholar origen carefully distinguishes between the forms of the prayer as found in matthew and luke respectively it might seem he says to most people that these evangelists record the same prayer but he rejects this point of view on two grounds first on account of their differences and secondly because the prayers are found in two different contexts mat thew placing it in the sermon on the mount luke as the answer to a disciple who asked the lord teach us to pray so he thinks that perhaps the preferable view of the matter is that the prayers are different though they have some parts common 33 29 xxxi 3 30 xxxiii i 31 xxxii 33 xviii 2 3 214 origen it is characteristic also that before he speaks about the prayer itself he should expatiate on the introduction to the prayer in matthew with its teaching on how we are to pray this point being a feature of this treatise indeed origen himself reminds us that he has already dealt with the manner of our approach to prayer accordingly he has a good deal to say about the lord's teaching concerning the manner of praying as given in matthew 6 5 9 upon which he comments at large in his usual discursive manner the texts as given by origen in xviii 2 are with one trifling exception 34 identical with those that underlie the rendering of the revised version so the prayers are as follows our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so on earth give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors and bring us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one 35 and father hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come give us day by day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we ourselves ako forgive every one who is indebted to us and bring us not into temptation 36 there is no reference to the variant let thy holy spirit come upon us and cleanse us in place of thy kingdom come or hallowed be thy name which is attested by origen's disciple gregory of nyssa among others nor of course to the much later doxology after dealing with the introduction to the prayer as given in matthew origen proceeds to comment at varying lengths upon each petition separately 34 in the lukan version origen has t ewrt instead of o xovn 35 matt 6 9 13 3 luke 11 2 4 on prayer 215 our father which art in heaven chapters xxii xxiii origen notes from his express examination of the scriptures for this point that to address god as father in prayer is a dis tinctively christian attitude as distinguished from the usage of the old testament where indeed god is often styled father and men his sons 35 but not in a prayer the use of father in prayer by our lord indicates a confident firm and unchangeable affirmation as concerning our relationship to god but a caveat is necessary sonship according to origen is not simply a status it involves character good works and a state of progres sive conformation to the divine image on the other hand he that doeth sin 37 has within him the seed of the devil and so long as it is inherent in the soul he cannot right himself it is when the word of god dwells in him that it is possible for the works of the devil to be destroyed for the evil seed to be done away with and for him to become the child of god the words which art in heaven give origen an opportunity which he is by no means loath to take of denying that god is circumscribed in bodily fashion and dwells locally in heaven if this were so it would follow that god was less than because contained by heaven such an idea arises from a too literal interpretation of these and other words in the bible on the part of simple folk but these passages must be understood in a man ner that befits grand and spiritual conceptions of god origen then proceeds to mention some of them and to expound them in a spiritual sense and he points out further that to suppose that god is in a place after the manner of a body leads to the most impious opinions namely that he is a body and therefore divisible material and corruptible this vigorous passage shows us origen at his best as an interpreter of scripture it has also an historical significance inasmuch as in later times in the fifth century some of his most ignorant opponents certain monks attacked him on the score of his teaching that god must not be thought of as possessing anything like a human form 38 hallowed be thy name chapter xxiv as arising out of this petition origen asks three questions i can a man ask that the name of god be hallowed as if it 1 john 3 8 3 f j fpakes jackson history of the christian churchy 445 2l6 origen had not been hallowed 2 what is the name of the father 3 what is its hallowing the second question is answered first a name is a compendious appellation manifesting the individual quality of the being named for example paul the apostle has a certain individual quality a quality of soul which makes it of a certain kind a quality of mind which makes him capable of contemplating certain kinds of things a quality of body which makes it of a certain kind the individuality of these qualities which is incommunicable to another for no be ing is exactly similar to paul is indicated by the name paul 5 to apply this to god the idea that we are taught to have within us of god is that he is holy and this conception of god is manifested to us in his several actions when he creates fore sees judges chooses forsakes receives turns away from deems worthy of honour punishes each one according to his deserts in this way the individual quality of god is characterized for us and we have what is called the name of god in the scriptures anyone who connects the idea of god with things that are not fitting takes the name of the lord in vain on the other hand he who by his words refreshes encourages or edifies the soul of another is able to do this because of the name for the char acter of god is seen in his action upon men for their own good and that of their fellows so we come to question 3 what is the hallowing of god's name origen quotes ps 34 3 let us exalt his name together we are commanded here he says to haste unto the true and lofty knowledge of the distinctive being of god to exalt the name of god is when a man partaking of deity exalts that very power of god of which he has partaken the answer to question i is left to the end of the chapter when we say hallowed be thy name though the verb is in the imperative mood the meaning is optative may thy name be hallowed this usage says origen occurs fre quently in the septuagint tatian in fact imagined wrongly from its frequent use that it was always so and accordingly fell into error concerning expressions in the first chapter of genesis thy kingdom come chapter xxv for origen the kingdom of god is immanent and spiritual he has no qualms as some moderns seem to have about accept ing the saying in luke the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or lo there but on prayer 217 the kingdom of god is within you 39 indeed he combines with this the saying in deuteronomy 40 the word is very nigh in your mouth and in your heart 35 i think he says that by god's kingdom is meant the blessed state of the reason and the ordered condition of wise thoughts every saint who takes god as his king and obeys the spiritual laws of god dwells in himself as in a well ordered city he draws a distinction be tween the kingdom of god and the kingdom of christ the latter is rather a saving power that goes forth into the world and is seen in action by christ's kingdom is meant the words that go forth for the salvation of those who hear them and the works of righteousness and the other virtues which are being accom plished this distinction helps origen to lead up eventually to one of his favourite texts which speaks of the time when christ shall deliver up the kingdom to god even the father that god may be all in all 41 but the use of this text also indicates that for origen the eschatological element in the kingdom of god was not entirely lacking indeed when he speaks of the kingdom as being within us he acknowledges that he may be met with the objection why then should we pray thy kingdom come 53 how shall a man still fittingly pray concerning things that are present already as if they were not present 55 the answer is that spiritual knowledge and understanding with which origen's conception of salvation 55 is largely bound up must be a growing thing we have the word of knowledge 55 and the word of wisdom 5 even now but we nevertheless pray for these things to receive more and more of them so that in this present life our knowledge in part will become as great as may be when however that which is perfect is come the mind without sense percep tion will come in contact with spiritual realities and without this the perfection of the kingdom cannot be our journey therefore in this life is unto perfection 42 and as we advance unceasingly the kingdom of god that is in us will reach its highest point when the saying of i cor 15 28 is fulfilled so we may fittingly here and now pray thy kingdom come even though the kingdom of god is within us 55 similarly also in the moral life the work of god within us begun now will be perfected when our corruptible has put on incorruption and the mortal has put on immortality 39 luke 17 20 21 dcut 30 14 41 i cor 15 24 28 42 heb 6 1 2l8 origen thy will be done as in heaven so on earth chapter xxvi origen points out that the words as in heaven so on earth are to be taken not only with thy will be done but also with hallowed be thy name and thy kingdom come 53 when we do the will of god when on earth he says we are made like unto those in heaven inasmuch as we bear as they do the image of the heavenly and shall inherit heaven an objection to the petition is next considered we are told that there are spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places 43 who bring about evil things on earth if therefore we pray that god's will be done on earth as it is in heaven we may unwittingly pray that these opposing forces may remain on earth to which they came from heaven a solution to this diffi culty is ready to hand if we allegorize heaven and earth understanding heaven as christ and earth as the church we shall then be praying that even as christ accom plished the father's will in its entirety so we the members of the church being joined to christ and become one spirit 44 with him may likewise achieve it it is no objection to this that christ says he has been given all authority in heaven and on earth 45 for christ is both man and saviour man mingled with deity and therefore both realms being his he takes as his fellow workers his disciples that he may bring the things on earth to a blessed issue but it still remains on the ordinary interpretation to explain how the will of god is done in heaven when the spiritual hosts of wickedness are in the heavenly places wrestling against those on earth origen replies in effect because the mind is its own place these hosts do not really dwell in heaven because of their evil disposition and therefore when we pray thy will be done as in heaven so on earth it is not to be reckoned that they are in heaven since they have fallen in mind with satan who fell from heaven like lightning 46 similarly he whose citizenship is in heaven though still on earth is no longer of the earth in the world below but of heaven and of the heavenly world that is better than this one give us this day our daily bread chapter xxvii this is one of the longest chapters on the lord's prayer and certainly the least satisfactory dominated as we have already eph 6 12 44 i cor 6 17 4s matt 28 18 luke 10 18 on prayer 2ig remarked 47 by the platonic conception of the material world origen dismisses the plain literal meaning of this petition in fact he asserts that it is a false opinion to be refuted to suppose that we are here told to pray concerning material lit bodily bread 48 accordingly the bread we pray for is not the bread that is to lie on our tables but the meat which abideth unto eternal life which the son of man shall give to feed on it is to feed on the spiritual teachings of christ what is more nourishing to the soul than the word and what is more precious to the mind of him who makes room for it than the wisdom of god and what is more appropriate to the rational soul than truth 35 v scripture however calls every kind of food bread and therefore the word which nourishes is varied and diverse for not all are able to be nourished by the solidity and vigorous force of the divine teachings 50 thus origen introduces us to one of his favourite thoughts as we have seen 51 that of different grades of hearers who live on different levels of spiritual appre hension and must be treated by the teacher accordingly 52 the unusual word for daily tmovalos bread next claims origen's attention he gives his view that it was coined by the evangelists 53 he derives it from epi and ousia 54 the bread that comes together into substance and he compares periousios laos 55 the people dwelling around substance the mention of the word ousia is sufficient to set origen off into a philosophical disquisition 56 and he now proceeds to give an account of the views of different schools of thought on sub stance this done he shows that there must be a kinship in substance between the bread given and the person who re ceives it the bread as he believes to have shown is spiritual therefore epiousios bread 56 is that which is best adapted to a reasonable nature and akin to it in its very substance it pro vides at once health and strength and vigour to the soul and imparts a share of its own immortality for the word of god is immortal to him who eats of it 57 he ends this part of the dis cussion by references from the bible to food partaken in common 47 see pp 210 f 48 xxvii i 49 xxvii 2 50 xxvii 4 5i see pp 199 f 52 xxvii 4 6 53 see note p 363 54 elsewhere section 13 he rejects the derivation from epienai to come close upon 55 ex 19 5 xxvii 8 57 xxvii 9 22o origen by men on the one hand and greater and inferior spiritual powers on the other 58 there is no reference to the eucharist the remainder 59 of the chapter is concerned with the meaning of today and day by day which origen interprets as this present age and successive ages respectively forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors chapter xxviii in contrast to his treatment of the foregoing petition origen expounds this one with refreshing realism we all owe debts to one another he says not only in respect of money but also in respect of particular actions and gentle speech and a charitable disposition further there are debts to be paid because we are in a certain relationship to others debts to our brethren in christ and debts due from us as citizens as husband or wife as a widow cared for by the church as a deacon or presbyter or bishop and we have a debt to ourselves so to use the body that we do not waste its powers in pleasure and above all we owe it to god to love him with all our heart and strength and mind we are debtors to christ since he has bought us with a price and also to the holy spirit we are debtors also to our guardian angel even though we do not know precisely who he is others are in debt to us but we must be gentle towards them when they are slow in paying back remembering the parable of the unmerciful servant there is a limitation however in re spect of our forgiveness of others says origen and with this point he closes the chapter it might seem when luke adds for we ourselves also forgive everyone that is indebted to us that there is no such limitation but the lord said to the apostles whose soever sins ye retain they are retained 60 and john says there is a sin unto death not concerning this do i say that he should make request 61 in the law also a sacrifice might not be offered for presumptuous sins it follows then that the christian also the true follower of jesus forgives what god forgives and retains such sins as god retains this leads origen on to refer to those persons 62 who have arrogated to themselves powers beyond the priestly office and boast that they are able to pardon even idolatry and forgive even such deadly sins as adultery or fornication 58 xxvii 10 12 59 xxvii 13 16 so john 20 23 si i john 5 16 62 see p 310 on prayer 221 bring us not into temptation chapter xxix it is not surprising to anyone who knows origen that he at once faces the obvious difficulty confronting the interpretation of this petition how can we be bidden he asks to use these words in prayer 3 when the whole of human life upon earth is a temptation 63 while on earth we are compassed about with the flesh that warreth against the spirit 64 and we wrestle not only with the flesh but also against the spiritual hosts of wicked ness 65 and paul tells the corinthians not that god will not suffer them to be tempted but that he will not suffer them to be tempted beyond their power 66 other passages of scripture are brought in for the purpose of proving the inevitability of temp tation even the apostles were not free from it as is clear from paul's account in the epistles to the corinthians of his trials and sufferings moreover temptation assails men in every condition of life the poor the rich the sick the whole persons of low as well as those of high degree the abject and those who are held in high esteem among men even the saviour was tempted and like the bridegroom in the song of songs looking at us through the meshes of temptation bids us arise 67 indeed temptation lurks even in the reading of the holy scriptures as is evident from the errors of those who like the marcionites 68 misinterpret the doctrine of god as it is set forth in the old and new testaments the true meaning therefore of the petition in the lord's prayer is not that we may not be tempted for that cannot be but that we may not be encompassed by temptation a thing that happens to those who are held fast in it and overcome similarly origen interprets the warning not to enter into temptation 69 as meaning to avoid being encompassed by temptation it is impossible then to think that the good god should en compass anyone with evil and cause him to be held fast by it it may be said however that the lord in giving the prayer was speaking to men of prayer and exhorting them to prayer against temptation what of those who do not pray or those whose prayer cannot be heard can god lead them into temptation in the sense of being brought under its domination this question quoting job 7 1 gal 5 17 es eph 6 12 66 i cot 10 13 67 see pp 376 f they are not actually named cf luke 22 40 222 origen is suggested by such phrases as are found in the first chapter of romans with reference to persons of dissolute character god gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto unclean ness god gave them up unto vile passions god gave them up unto a reprobate mind the marcionites cannot maintain that these words are used of the god of the law who they mistakenly suppose is other than the good father of our lord jesus christ and therefore they must find in them a stumbling block to their notions nevertheless the difficulty in such phrases as god gave them up unto vile passions as well as in bring us not into temptation remains how is it to be overcome origen puts forward the following solution 70 i verily believe that god orders every rational soul with a view to its eternal life and that it always maintains its free will and of its own motion either mounts higher and higher until it reaches the pinnacle of virtue or on the contrary descends through carelessness to this or that excess of wickedness if the soul chooses the downward grade and falls into a sinful state it may be that a rapid and brief cure will cause it to regard lightly the disease into which it has fallen so that after being restored to health it may fall the second time into the same con dition therefore in such cases god may for a time disregard increasing wickedness up to a certain point and even overlook it when it has developed to such an extent as to be incurable in order that the soul may take its fill of evil and being glutted with the sin it desires may at last become conscious of its evil plight and hate what it formerly welcomed a parallel is adduced from the mixed multitude when in the wilderness they lusted after the fleshpots of egypt 71 the lord glutted them with the food they desired for a month of days until it came out at their nostrils and became loathsome unto them 72 so also the kind and good god may even be said to give up men to their evil passions in order to satiate them with their lust that this life ended they may no longer wish to return to them but recognizing their desperate condition may of their own free will come to hate that which they formerly desired and seek for heavenly things the chapter ends with a short account of the use of tempta tion it reveals character what our soul has received is unknown to all except god is unknown even to ourselves but it is mani fested by means of temptations temptations when they come to xxix 13 7i num 11 4 6 7 num 11 18 30 on prayer 223 make it plain to us of what sort we are make known the hidden things of the heart this is clearly stated in scripture as for example in the passage in deuteronomy which says that the trials in the wilderness were sent in order that the things in the heart of god's people might be made known 73 similarly the temptations which beset eve cain the sons of noah esau and joseph did not for the first time make them what they were seen to be but rather manifested the weakness or strength that al ready lay in their characters therefore we must not wait until the temptations come but prepare ourselves by the power of god in the times between temptations so that we shall not be proved unready when they come deliver us from the evil one chapter xxx the student of origen will not need to be told that he be lieved in a personal devil consequently it is clear throughout the short passage which deals with this petition that he inter prets rov irovrjpov as masculine with the revised version and not as neuter with the authorized version the passages of scripture used to describe the assaults of the devil are eph 6 16 and job chs i and 2 origen expounds deliver us from the evil one on the same lines as bring us not into temptation god delivers us from the evil one not when the enemy or the ministers of his will in no way attack us but when we conquer bravely taking a firm stand against circumstances this is clearly indicated in the book of job the patriarch was delivered from the evil one not by immunity from attacks of the devil for the lord gave him authority to attack job but by the fact that in all his trials job sinned not before the lord the ex perience of the saviour in the wilderness likewise illustrates the meaning of this petition his deliverance consisted not in ab sence of temptation indeed he was three times assailed but in his conquest over it as for ourselves the soul must be prepared for such attacks if we are to overcome them we are to have within ourselves rivers of water springing up unto eternal life 74 if we are to quench the fiery darts of the evil one 75 contemplation of the truth will stamp upon the soul of the spiritual athlete inspired and saving thoughts for his use in time of need 73 deut 8 2 3 15 74 john 7 38 4 14 75 eph 6 16 224 origen comparison with the de oratione of tertullian origen was not the first of the fathers to write a treatise on prayer and the lord's prayer being preceded in this respect by about twenty years by tertullian whose work is placed between the limits of 196 203 76 or 200 206 77 the purpose and scope of the two treatises are so different that any attempted comparison between them is certainly very difficult and may seem to be even misleading origen writes as we have seen primarily for christians of standing and intelligence who were disingenuous enough to propound questions which struck at the very root of the efficacy of prayer tertullian wrote for catechumens 78 who are described in his de baptismo as those whom the grace of god awaits and he assumes without question the rationale of prayer again as regards length origen's treatise occupies 106 pages of the berlin corpus of the fathers tertullian's twenty pages only of the vienna corpus and the treatments of the lord's prayer vary correspondingly in length but against this disparity in length we must set the fact that tertullian is as concise as origen is discursive in spite of these differences of approach to the subject how ever a comparison between the two treatises may have its value since no two men can traverse the same ground without reveal ing those differences which lie deeper than the mere setting in which their treatment of the theme is found and also the com mon ground great or small on which in spite of differences they stand in this particular case the common ground is by no means large there are however a few points of resemblance between the two treatments of the subject for both writers the lord's prayer is the primary source and model of christian teaching to which they refer again both writers dwell on what the sermon on the mount matt ch 6 has to say about ostentation and much speaking in prayer the distinctively christian address of father in prayer is noted by both writers and they both speak of the proper attitude of mind and disposition of him who comes to prayer there must be no hatred of our brother or anger or even perturbation of mind 79 but at the outset of the treatment of the lord's prayer itself 7 harnack 77 bardenhewer and d'ales 78 consideremus itaque benedict ch i for benedicti see de baptismo xx benedicti quos gratia del expectat w tertullian de oratione chs xi xii on prayer 225 differences begin to appear origen is a critical textual scholar he notes that the prayer according to the gospels was given on two different occasions and that the text of the two prayers differs considerably before he begins his exegesis he sets out the two texts 80 and continues to keep their differences before him tertullian on the other hand ignores the presence of these differences if he knew of them and confines his exposition to what is broadly speaking a version of the matthaean text although curiously enough he begins simply with pater 81 as does the lukan text even though his version contains at least one feature which must have been abnormal he places thy kingdom come 5 after hallowed be thy name thy will be done in heaven and on earth he does not comment upon any facts of this kind in the exegesis of the prayer much of the difference in the two writers is to be traced ultimately to a difference in philosophical outlook conscious in the case of origen perhaps unconscious for tertullian and particularly in respect of transcendence and immanence material and spiritual for origen 82 the kingdom is above all things immanent and spiritual and the eschatolo gical aspect is secondary and in the sense that the spiritual apprehension of the truth must go on growing and increasing until the consummation is reached when that which is perfect is come and god shall be all in all tertullian 83 on the other hand emphasizes the literal and eschatological sense of the kingdom of god it is true that there is never a time when god does not reign and he reigns in us but the coming of the king dom is the coining manifestation of the rule of god it is future the souls of the martyrs beneath the altar cry out how long it is for us a matter of earnest expectation tertullian's attitude is definitely other worldly he would approve of the senti ment of the prayer in which we ask god shortly to accomplish the number of thine elect and to hasten thy kingdom chris tians he says are illogical if with the words thy kingdom come on their lips they desire any delay of the final consum mation seeing that now we are in servitude then we shall reign optamus maturius regnare et non diutius servire in expounding the petition thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven both writers admit that a simple literal inter pretation is on the surface impossible but when they proceed to consider what the deeper spiritual meaning of earth and so ch xviii si but in ado prax 23 pater noster 82 xxv i 2 83 ch v a.g 15 226 origen heaven may be they part company tertullian 84 holds that in this sense earth and heaven mean respectively flesh and spirit origen allegorizes differently he notes the diffi culty arising out of the fact that there are spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places heaven may mean then christ while earth may be interpreted the church but he goes on to give another and it would appear a prefer able interpretation namely that setting aside all local and temporal ideas he that doeth the will of god is heaven and persons of bad character are earth 86 in the next petition even more marked differences of treat ment appear as we have noted origen spiritualizes altogether the daily bread and in fact calls it a false opinion to hold that material bread is spoken of 87 tertullian 88 extols the divine wisdom which has so arranged the order of the prayer that after things heavenly should come earthly necessities this he points out is in accordance with the command seek ye first the kingdom and then these things also shall be added unto you having said so much however tertullian goes on to say that nevertheless we may rather understand give us this day our daily bread 3 spiritually for christ is our bread and christ is life and bread is life and he said c i am the bread of life 5 but even on this plane of interpretation differences between the two writers manifest themselves tertullian at once speaks of the eucharist and of the bread of which christ said this is my body origen who has a long disquisition on the petition never includes in it a reference to the eucharist to feed on christ is to feed on his spiritual teachings the remaining two petitions of the lord's prayer do not provide much material for the purposes of comparison either in respect of agreement or of disagreement and so we may pass on to underline an important difference between the two treatises that is to be found throughout them as a whole origen speaks almost entirely of private prayer of individual prayer although he notes the added value of prayers in common when christian disciples meet for worship 89 and he refers very sel dom to the ordinances of the church 90 tertullian on the other hand at the outset of his treatise 91 places prayer in the context of the church speaking of the opening words of the lord's prayer he says in the father the son is invoked for saith 84 cb iv 85 xxvi 4 86 xxvi 6 87 xxvii i 8s ch vi 89 xxxi 5 see pp 201 f si ch ii on prayer 227 he c and the father are one 5 notably different from origen who allows prayer in the proper sense of the term to be addressed to the father only 92 then 3 rather naively he adds nor is even our mother the church passed by if that is in the father and the son is recognized the mother from whom arises the name both of father and son accordingly in the course of the treatise and especially when he comes to speak of the manner and posture and place of prayer he has many references to church ordinances and seasons and customs the liturgical setting of prayer he speaks of eucharist and the words this is my body 93 of the kiss of peace and about communicating on station days 94 later on he mentions the singing of the psalms and the liturgical use of alleluia 95 speaking of the question of kneeling at prayer 96 he mentions that though some refrained from kneeling on saturdays the tradition he has received is that we do not kneel on sundays or in the spatio pentecostes interval between easter and pentecost quae eadem exultationis sol lemnitate dispungitur we are however to kneel on fasts and station days and we ought to prostrate ourselves before god every day or certainly when we pray the first thing in the morning per contra when origen 97 is discussing this question he speaks only of kneeling as a symbol of the man who is abject and submissive and says nothing about kneeling in church again when we compare passages which cite the scriptures as proving the power and efficacy of prayer we discover a dif ference of outlook between the two writers we have seen 98 what origen's treatment of give us this day our daily bread is and also how he contrasts the old testament with its record of material benefits vouchsafed through prayer with the purely spiritual objects the great and heavenly things for which a christian ought to pray in fact when he says 99 that prayers similar to those which brought blessing to old testament saints are answered also today he is not referring to the same kind of answer but to a spiritualized version of it tertullian's treatment of this matter is different the concluding chapter 1 of his de oratione is an eloquent description of the power and efficacy of prayer like origen he contrasts old testament with christian prayers prayer in olden times indeed used to free from fires and from beasts and from famine he is probably referring to 92 xv i 93 ch vi 4 ghs xviii xix 95 chs xxvii xxviii 96 ch xxiii 97 xxxi 3 98 pp 218 ff 263 266 99 xiii 3 i xxix 228 origen dan chs 3 and 6 and i kings ch 18 with james 5 17,18 but how far more fully operative is christian prayer it does not station the angel of dew in mid fires 2 nor stop the mouths of lions nor transfer to the hungry the rustics 3 meal 3 it has no grace given it to remove any sense of suffering but it supplies with endurance those who are suffering feeling grieving but this spiritual power this ability to endure be it noted is given because of the presence of material afflictions or tortures it is not a defence against the unseen powers of evil as origen would interpret and again according to tertullian is it any wonder if prayer knows how to extort the rains 4 of heaven which was once able to procure its fires 5 and this is natural rain not the rain of the soul 6 which according to origen is the fulfilment of which the rain procured by the prayer of elijah is the type further in conclusion among the many benefits resulting from christian prayer tertullian reckons many which concern the body prayer is able to recall the souls of the departed from the very path of death to renew the weak to heal the sick to purge them that are possessed of devils to open prison bars to loose the bonds of the innocent finally it is impossible to avoid contrasting the general out look of tertullian upon christianity and the particular subject of prayer with that of origen for tertullian christianity is a spiritual law and discipline with its prescribed duties when we pray we obey an order praeceptum of god and when we call him father we acknowledge his authority potestas 7 it is not indeed that tertullian hankers after judaism that indeed has passed away the gospel is the fulfiller 8 of the whole ancient system but in its place have come the commandments of god in christ including particularly his command concerning prayer and its prescribed form and our mother the church deduced by tertullian as a natural consequent of father and son 9 also prescribes services and forms and customs the whole setting of tine treatise is placed in the sphere of spiritual duty the fife of the household the church is conceived after the 2 origen also refers to the whistling dewy wind dan 3 49 50 lxx which tempered the fire for the three holy children 3 bel and the dragon 33 a reference to the story apologeticus v eusebius h.e v 5 of the thundering legion when christians in the army of marcus aurelius by means of prayer brought down a refreshing shower upon soldiers who were in danger of perishing by thirst 5 ii kings 1 10 ff xiii 5 ch ii 8 ch l 9 ch il on prayer 229 manner of domestic life in a roman household where the patria potestas was a living reality setting a rule and standard for all its members in that setting there is little room or desire to dwell upon matters which might weaken the sense of prescribed duty such as differences in the text of holy scripture criticism and interpretation of the bible possible objections alternative renderings speculations and insoluble problems with all of these on the contrary origen is pre occupied it is part of his conception of christianity which is to apprehend the truth of christ and to feed upon his teachings if tertullian's watch word is duty origen's is understanding though not simply understanding that is intellectual but including also mystical apprehension and self devotion which issues in a christian way of life thus in less than two hundred years profound differences of outlook had manifested themselves in christianity carthage and alexandria are in the same continent about a thousand miles of coastline separate them one from the other but ter tullian and origen inhabit a different world spiritually and intellectually a difference that may be expressed in various ways as for example by saying that the one was latin the other greek the one authoritative the other speculative the one ex clusive the other comprehensive the one reactionary the other liberal quid athenis et hierosolymis 10 cries tertullian what have athens and jerusalem in common and he pro ceeds away with those who put forward a stoic a platonic a dialectic sort of christianity we have no need for curious speculation once we have accepted christ jesus nor for inquiry after receiving the gospel once we believe we desire no further belief for our belief is this that there is nothing which we ought to believe besides it is better frankly to acknowledge that these two extreme types of christianity emerged early in its history and have con tinued ever since than to attempt a formal reconciliation be tween them if we will allow room for them both in a catholic church we shall serve the church better than by seeking for them a common denominator perhaps it is necessary to say this today for we live at a time when pattern has become a blessed word in theology by using it some lull themselves into the comfortable frame of mind which sees a uniformity in christian faith and practice which does not in fact exist pat tern is a tendentious a misleading but nevertheless for many 10 de prescription 7 230 origen a soporific word it persuades those who use it into a totalitarian kind of belief that all happens according to plan in com paring these two treatises of tertullian and origen the present writer makes no attempt to establish a common pattern be tween them he has pointed out a few similarities of thought and treatment but the two works as well as the two authors differ toto caelo they exhibit not a pattern but the much variegated wisdom of god 11 text transmission manuscripts and editions that the treatise on prayer has come down to us at all must be regarded as a fortunate circumstance as we have seen 12 certain passages in the work were accounted heretical and this in turn doubtless affected its transmission from early times quite apart from the general destruction of origen's manu scripts as a result of the controversies of which he was the storm centre in fact we are ultimately dependent for the greek text upon a single ms which has had a precarious history and might well have never survived its chequered fortunes and there is no latin translation of the de orations as there is of so many of origen's other works there are indeed few references to the treatise in the extant literature of the early church the apologia pro origene written conjointly by pamphilus and euse bius c 308 because of the fault finders 13 mentions it as ex tant it is true that we possess this apology only in the latin translation of rufinus and that too of the first book only but there is no reason but rather the contrary why rufinus should have included a reference to the book if he did not find it in the original this translation was made in 398 the reference is as follows 14 denique in tarn multis et tarn diversis eius libris nusquam omnino invenitur ab eo liber proprie de anima con scriptus sicut habet vel de martyrio vel de oratione vel de resurrectione 15 there is no reference to the de oratione in the list of origen's works to be found in jerome ep xxxiii ad paulam 16 but jerome is here chiefly concerned to enumerate origen's labours in biblical exegesis qui tanto in sanctamm scriptarum commentariis sudore laboravit ut iuste adamantis nomen acceperit therefore his omission to mention the treat ise is not conclusive of his ignorance of its existence in fact he does not mention the contra celsum either nor does it follow that n eph 3 10 12 see pp 187 ff eusebius h.k vi 33 4 14 ch 8 15 routh reliquiae sacrae iv 379 c.v liv 253 ff on prayer 231 gregory and basil did not know the de oratione because they did not include a passage from it in the philocalia this work mainly consists of passages which exemplify origen's power of resolving difficult questions arising out of the holy scriptures 17 the synodical letter of theophilus of alexandria a bitter opponent of origen ad palestinos et ad cyprios episcopos missa c 400 and translated by jerome 18 mentions the de oratione expressly when it includes among the errors of origen what he wrote about praying to the father only cum legeretur in alio libro qui e de oratione scribitur non debemus orare filium sed solum patrem nee patrem cum filio obturavimus aures nostras et tarn origenem quam discipulos eius consona voce damnavimus ne et modicum fermentum totam massam corrumperet again in another a paschal letter also translated by jerome 19 theophilus attacks at greater length the same point in origen's teaching he places origen on a level in this respect with pharaoh who said i know not the lord 5520 nee est aliud dicere nescio dominum 5 quam hoc quod dicit origenes c non est orandus films inasmuch as christ is the son of god it follows as a right and proper conse quence that he is to be invoked and prayer is to be made to him as indeed we are taught in the scriptures to do acts 7 60 phil 2 10 the first of these quotations is an unhappy one from the point of view of theophilus s criticism as origen ex pressly quotes these words of stephen lord lay not this sin to their charge as an example of intercession which he dis tinguishes from prayer in the full sense of the term being rightly made to the son 21 origen says theophilus does not believe in the deity of the son itaque nee deum credit origenes filium dei quern non putat adorandum the name of divinity that he gives him is only an empty name he thinks that he under stands the meaning of the scriptures but he does not hear what moses says against him whosoever curseth god shall bear his sin he that nameth the name of the lord shall surely die the whole congregation shall stone him 22 acquaintance with the de oration has been claimed for am brose in virtue of certain passages in the de sacramentis 23 and de fide 24 see note on xxvii 9 there are marked differences however between ambrose and origen 1 ypa.if ik v rfrr larwv

sixth century afford evidence of his knowledge of the de oratione in so far as he finds in it the idea that the resurrection body is spherical in his epistle to mennas patriarch of con stantinople he says 25 for he sc origen says that in the resurrection men's bodies are raised spherical o the folly and stupidity of this crazy fellow this expounder of greek opinions darkened in his understanding and eager to mix up myths with the christian faith he aimed at casting insult upon the very hope and salvation of christians that is the resurrection promised to us not even reverencing the resurrection of the lord for if as origen madly supposes the body of the lord was spherical how was he able to show the piercings of his hands and feet or the wound in his side or how could he eat or be recognized at all by his disciples and how also could the bodies of the saints which were raised after the lord's resurrection and seen in the holy city have been known by others if they were really in a form different from that which they had in life the epistle to mennas concludes with a series often anathemas against origen's teachings of which the following is the fifth 26 if anyone says or holds that at the resurrection men's bodies are raised spherical and does not acknowledge that we are raised upright let him be anathema a similar condemnation is to be found in the tenth of the fifteen anathemas against origen discovered by peter lambeck the librarian of vienna towards the end of the seventeenth century which some hold to have been adopted by the fifth general council but others more probably assign to a home synod that is a synod held in 543 at constantinople of the bishops of the locality 27 the translation of this anathema runs as follows if anyone shall say that after the resurrection the body of the lord was ethereal and spherical in form and that such shall be the bodies of all after the resurrection and that after the lord himself shall have rejected his true body and after the others who rise shall have rejected theirs the nature of their bodies shall be an nihilated let him be anathema on the other hand photius 28 refers to an anonymous de fender of origen the counts on which he asserts that he sc origen was falsely accused are fifteen in number which he declares to be mere slanders he is charged with teaching 2sp.g lxxxvi i 9 73 2 ib

this is a reference to the teaching of the de oratione because although origen elsewhere in his writings 29 says that prayer should be addressed to the father it is only in the present treatise that he enjoins prayer in the proper sense of the term to the father alone 9 that is to say in so many words it is not surprising therefore that under this barrage of criticism although it was directed against at the most two points in the treatise its circulation came almost to an end in fact it is preserved for us in a single ms which if it had been lost and it might well have been no trace or fragment or copy of the work would now remain this ms is now in the library of trinity college cambridge b.s.io formerly styled holmiensis 30 known under the symbol t written on paper of the fourteenth or fifteenth century apart from eight inconsiderable lacunae near the beginning it contains the whole of the treatise bound together with it is another work of origen his commentary on matthew written in another older hand the scribe of t appears to have been a conscientious person for where the text he was copying was missing or illegible he leaves in every case just so much empty space as seems necessary to him so that he could eventually later on supply the missing words from another codex lacunae falling at regular intervals are found at the beginning of the ms pointing to the fact that in the archetype the first or last lines of a page were partly or wholly destroyed or rendered illegible by some cause prob ably damp it cannot now be determined to what century this archetype belonged but koetschau 31 argues that not many intermediaries lay between it and t since the text has been handed down in comparatively good order t has had an interesting but precarious history when the cathedral library of worms was plundered by soldiers it was purchased from them for a small sum by a person named rumfius physician to elizabeth queen of the bohemians he brought it from germany to the hague where it passed from his possession to that of the famous scholar isaac voss who in turn brought it to sweden where it was lodged along with other manuscripts in the library at stockholm there some 29 see pp 346 ff ao so called because it was once lodged in the library of holmia stock holm 31 i ixxxvii 234 origen twenty years after voss had acquired it another scholar peter daniel huet came across it in the library and made a copy of it in the year 1652 subsequently voss allowed the use of the ms to herbert thorndike 1598 1672 fellow of trinity college who was contemplating an edition of the complete works of origen 32 it remained in thorndike s possession later on he bequeathed it to the library of his college the transcript made by huet is known as cod parisin suppl gr nr 534 the concluding part of the treatise on prayer from xxxi i to xxxiii 3 has been separately handed down in another ms cod parisin gr nr 1788 colbert 3607 cited as col written according to a subscription written in greek by a monk named gennadius in the year 1440 a note written in a hand of the fifteenth century gives the following facts con cerning the history and ownership of the codex which is of a miscellaneous character containing several works of which this fragment forms part namely that it came originally from constantinople having been purchased after the capture of that city by a certain man named luke zonaras who was from the wholly wretched and miserable island of lesbos it re mained in his possession until the taking of this island i.e in the year 1462 when it passed into the hands of one sophianus of phocia 33 and then finally into those of sophianus the writer of the note the first editor to use this fragment was delarue see below who believed that it was a valuable help in the restoration of that part of the text of the treatise which it con tains but koetschau 34 has shown that the most of the variants of col from t are scribal errors and omissions due to negligence or wilful alteration and that col has never more to offer but in numerous passages less than t and that in fact in t we see the text from which col is derived this view is confirmed by the fact that t and col have certain mis readings in common further the scribe of col behaves throughout in so incon sistent and arbitrary a manner that one need not in order to expose his many faults interpose an intermediary between t and col since then t and col are not independent and 32 t a lacey in his herbert thorndike pp 25 ff mentions many greek and latin fathers whom thorndike cites but origen is not among them but b f westcott d.c.b iv 141 notes that thorndike had indeed con templated an edition of origen's works but had abandoned the project because inter alia he had learned of huet's intention to carry out a similar task 33 in asia minor 4 i ixxxv on prayer 235 since col as we have seen originally came from constantinople it is not unlikely that t also had its habitat there and hence also in all likelihood its place of origin perhaps the passage i quoted earlier 35 in this section from photius may be significant in this connection if in constantinople of the ninth century there were known to be apologists of origen's treatise it is likely enough that a ms containing it would escape the harsher fate that fell upon its fellows in other parts of the world the following are the editions of this treatise that have been published up till now 1 editio princeps printed and published in oxford in the year 1682 the editor is anonymous in his praefatio he says that he has given a transcript apographum of that manuscript which is now preserved at cambridge in the library of the college of the holy trinity of whose existence voss had made him aware this codex he remarks is non admodum feliciter descriptus it contains considerable lacunae and is so full of abbreviations that it required an interpreter rather than a reader to transcribe it a latin translation is added in which the editor acknowledges the help he had received from gale 36 who not merely translated the greek text supplied him by the editor but also reviewed suspected passages by reference to t so that the latin translation as corrected by gale is often a substantial improvement 2 next in order of time is the edition of the treatise pub lished at basle by j r wetstein the elder in 1694 the im provement in this edition over its predecessor is mainly due to the fact that gale's recension of codex t is utilized the exemplar of the oxford edition used by wetstein is now in the library of gottingen university it contains in the margin gale's collation of each passage but it will be seen from what follows that much further work had yet to be done on the text indeed the master of a college in cambridge referred to in the following paragraph scathingly speaks of the basil edition as being a mere repetition of the oxford bating a few alterations of little moment some for the better some for the worse 3 first in order of merit among early editions is that of william reading london 1728 this edition is dedicated to baron roger meredith who is described as ornatissimus vir its special value lies in the fact that reading made use of a fresh collation of t and notes by an anonymous scholar in fact a 35 p 232 3 le thorns gale dean of york c 1635 1702 236 origen new edition of the book which were sent to reading by the master of a college in cambridge whom reading describes in his preface as vir singularis eruditionis animique in me bene volentissimi with permission to publish them if he thought fit without however disclosing the name of the donor the reason for all this secrecy is not apparent in any case the work of the anonymous scholar included in this edition was the most valu able contribution to the criticism of the de oratione that had so far been made not only did he collate codex t more systematic ally and thoroughly than either of his two predecessors but by his notes which are the result of genuine scholarship and of knowledge in particular of the writings of origen he contri buted even more than richard bentley did to the purifying and emendation of the text 4 charles delarue in his edition of origen's works vol i pp 196 272 paris 1733 reproduced the text of wetstein's edition but also utilized an admittedly insufficient collation of codex t which john walker an english presbyter had made for him he also examined the fragment contained in codex paris no 1788 col he added a latin translation made by claudius fleury for huet but a more momentous addition appeared in the footnotes which give the ingenious though often audacious conjectural emendations of richard bentley 5 charles henry edward lommatzch who published a recension of the work of delarue in twenty five volumes gives the text of the de oratione in vol xviii pp 82 297 berlin 1844 this differs only in a few places in the text from that of delarue and whereas delarue had printed the critical notes of the anonymous scholar at the end of his first volume lom matzch adds these to each respective passage of the text 6 the edition used in preparing this translation is that of paul koetschau leipzig 1899 the berlin corpus of the fathers entitled die griechischen christlichen schriftsteller der ersten drei jahrhunderte the introduction to die schrift von gebet is in vol i of origen's works pp ixxv xcii the text in vol ii pp 297 403 this edition which is a worthy contribution to modern scholarship and to the series in which it is included is based on a new collation of codex t made by c j bellairs gaskoin it is indispensable to a critical study of the treatise koetschau has been careful to give as accurately as possible the number of letters or lines to be estimated for each of the lacunae in t his apparatus criticus gives full information concerning not on prayer 237 only variants but also emendations of the anonymous bentley and others he says however that from the text in t i have departed only seldom and for compelling reasons 37 from this point of view it is not surprising that koetschau often and to the mind of the present writer too frequently dismisses proposed emendations with the terse formula ohne grund this how ever does not seriously impair the value of koetschau's text of which every serious student of the de oratione must be conscious i must personally acknowledge my own indebtedness to his edition not only throughout this book but especially in writing this section of the introduction and the section which deals with the occasion of the treatise koetschau stands out among those who in the last three hundred years have laboured to make this work of origen accessible in scholarly form it appears here in an english translation which it is hoped will not be found entirely inadequate but the translator must conclude as origen himself does by acknowledging the diffi culty of the task as a ground for asking the indulgence of the reader 37 i xc on prayer the text introduction chapters i and ii i i inasmuch as the greatest themes surpass man's under standing and transcend exceedingly our perishable nature it is impossible for the reason of the race of mortals to grasp them nevertheless this becomes possible by the will of god in the abundant and immeasurable grace of god that is poured forth by him upon men through jesus christ who ministers unto us his unsurpassable grace and through his fellow worker the spirit certainly it is impossible for human nature to acquire that wisdom by which all things have been established 1 for according to david god made all things in wisdom 2 what is impossible however becomes possible through our lord jesus christ who was made unto us wisdom from god and righteousness and sanctification and redemption 3 for what man shall know the counsel of god or who shall con ceive what the lord willeth because the thoughts of mortals are timorous and our devices are prone to fail for a corruptible body weigheth down the soul and the earthy frame lieth heavy on a mind that is full of cares and hardly do we divine the things that are on earth but the things that are in the heavens who ever yet traced out 4 nevertheless this impossibility becomes possible by the exceeding grace of god 5 for he who was caught up into the third heaven 6 traced out 7 per chance the things in the three heavens because he had heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter 8 but who can say that it is possible for the mind of the lord i gf heb 3 4 2 p s 104 24 3 i cor 1 30 4 wisdom of solomon 9 13 16 5 n cor 9 14 e ii cor 12 2 7 wisdom of solomon 9 16 s ii cor 12 4 238 on prayer 239 to be known 9

even so the things of god none knoweth save the spirit of god 1 g ut jf none knoweth the things of god save the spirit of god it is impossible for man to know the things of god consider also however how it becomes possible but we he says received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us by god which things also we speak

ceased to be after the manner of women as it had ceased to be with sarah 14 you are somewhat at a loss why when the subject before us is prayer we should begin by speaking of the things which though impossible for men yet become possible by the grace of god one of these impossible things having regard to our weakness is i believe to give a clear exact and appropriate account of the whole matter of prayer how we ought to pray what things we ought to say to god in prayer and what times are more suitable than others for prayer 15 we know that paul who because of the ex ceeding greatness of the revelations took care lest any man should account of him above that which he seeth him to be or heareth from 16 him confessed that he did not know how to pray as he ought 17 for as concerning what ought 9 cf rom 11 34 i cor 2 16 isa 40 13 10 a lacuna of three and a half lines occurs here in the ms t which koet schau conjecturally fills up as above 11 john 15 14 15 12 i cor 2 11 13 i cor 2 12 13 u gen 18 11 15 a lacuna of four and one fifth lines about 300 letters occurs here in the ms doubtless at this point origen referred to the need for divine grace to help him in his task as we find him doing lower down in this chapter sect 6 is ii con 12 7 6 rom 8 26 240 origen to be prayed for he says we know not as we ought so it is necessary not only to pray but also to pray as we ought and to pray for what we ought for it is not enough that we should be able to pray for what we ought unless in addition we possess the as we ought and what does the as we ought profit us if we do not know how to pray for what we ought 2 now of these two things the one that is to say what we ought is concerned with the words of prayer the other as we ought with the condition of him who is praying examples of what we ought are ask for the great things and the little things shall be added unto you 18 and ask for the heavenly things and the earthly things 19 shall be added unto you 20 and pray for them that despitefully use you 21 and pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he send forth labourers into his harvest 22 and pray that ye enter not into tempta tion 23 and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on a sabbath 24 and and in praying use not vain repetitions 25 and any other sayings like these an example of as we ought is i desire therefore that the men pray in every place lifting up holy hands without wrath and disputing in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefastness and sobriety not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly raiment but which becometh women professing godliness through good works 26 instruc tion on as we ought is also to be found in the passage if therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar and there re memberest that thy brother hath aught against thee leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift 27 for what greater gift can a reasonable creature 28 present to god than a sweet savoured 28 word of prayer offered by one whose con science is void of the foul savour that comes from sin further instruction on as we ought is defraud ye not one the other except it be by consent for a season that ye may give yourselves unto prayer and may be together again that satan rejoice not over you 29 because of your incontinency 30 from this it follows is see note of john 3 12 20 gf matt 6 33 luke 12 31 21 luke 6 28 22 matt 9 38 luke 10 2 23 luke 22 40 matt 26 415 mark 14 38 24 matt 24 20 mark 13 18 25 matt 6 7

of the ineffable mysteries of marriage due regard is paid to gravity infrequency and absence of passion for the consent here mentioned does away with the disorder of passion removes incontinency and hinders the joy that satan takes in an other's ill in addition to these passages instruction on as we ought is to be found in the saying if we stand praying for give if ye have aught against anyone 31 also the passage in paul every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoured his head but every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoured her head 32 is indicative of as we ought 3 paul knew all these passages and could quote a great many more besides from the law and the prophets and from their fulfilment 33 the gospel and give a varied exposition of each of them nevertheless it is out of a true as well as a modest disposition that he says for in spite of all this knowledge he saw how far off he was from knowing what we ought to pray for as we ought as touching what we ought to pray for we know not as we ought 34 and in addition to this saying he also indicates the means whereby what is lacking is supplied for the man who though ignorant renders himself worthy to have what is lacking in himself supplied for he says the spirit himself maketh intercession to god with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god 35 now the spirit who cries in the hearts of the blessed ones abba father 36 knowing full well the groanings in this tabernacle 37 that they are cap able of weighing down those who have fallen or transgressed maketh intercession to god with groanings which cannot be uttered 38 and out of his great kindness and sympathy receives our groanings and when in accordance with the wisdom that is in him he sees our soul humbled to the dust 39 and confined in the body of humiliation 40 he maketh intercession to god using no ordinary groanings but certain which cannot be uttered which appertain to those unspeakable words which it is not possible for a man to utter 41 in very truth this spirit not content simply to intercede with god intensifies the 3i mark 1 1 25 see note 32 i ck r x i 4j 5 33 of matt 5 1 7 34 rom 8 26 35 rom 8 26 27 36 gal 4 6 37 ii cor 5 4 38 rom 8 26 39 ps 44 25

these things we conquer exceedingly 43 probably he merely intercedes for those who on the one hand are not so great as to conquer exceedingly 5 and yet on the other are not such as to be conquered but rather are conquering 4 related to the text we know not what we ought to pray for as we ought but the spirit intercedes exceedingly to god with groanings which cannot be uttered 44 is the text i will pray with the spirit and i will pray with the under standing also i will sing with the spirit and i will sing with the understanding also 45 for neither can our understanding pray unless previously the spirit prays hearkening 46 as it were to it nor likewise can it sing and hymn the father in christ with rhythm melody measure and harmony unless the spirit who searcheth all things yea the deep things of god 47 first praise and hymn him whose deep things he has searched and so far as he is able 48 apprehended one of the disciples of jesus being conscious in himself as i suppose of human weakness in its ignorance concerning how one ought to pray and recognizing this especially when he heard the wise and great words uttered by the saviour in prayer to his father when the lord ceased praying said lord teach us to pray even as john also taught his disciples the following is the full context of the saying and it came to pass as he was praying in a certain place that when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray even as john also taught his disciples 49 to pray 50 is it then that a man brought up in the instruction of the law and in hearing the words of the prophets and a constant frequenter of the synagogues did not know how to pray at all until he saw the lord praying in a certain place it would be absurd to assert this undoubtedly he was accustomed to pray in the jewish fashion but he saw that he needed greater knowledge in the matter of prayer moreover what did john teach his disciples concerning prayer as they came unto him to be baptized 42 rom 8 26 origen here makes the point that paul does not simply say mryxdvt as in v 27 but vttpvtvyx v the english bible versions do not attempt to reproduce this distinction 43 rom 8 37 44 rom 8 26 45 i cor 14 15 46 see note 47 i cor 2 10 48 sec no te 49 luke 11 1 so a lacuna of two and a half lines occurs here in the ms probably con taining a citation of matt 3 5 6 on prayer 243 from jerusalem and all judaea and the region round about 51 unless it was that being much more than a prophet 52 he saw certain things concerning prayer which i dare say he delivered secretly not to all those who were being baptized but to those who were under instruction as disciples for baptism 5 such prayers being truly spiritual for the spirit prays in the hearts of the saints have been recorded and they are filled with unutterable and marvellous teachings an example in the first book of the kingdoms is the prayer of hannah 53 which is given in part for the whole prayer when she continued praying before the lord speaking in her heart has not been written down 54 in the psalms the sixteenth psalm is entitled a prayer of david and the eighty ninth a prayer of moses the man of god and the one hundred and first a prayer of the poor man when he is uncared for and pours forth his petition before the lord 55 such prayers since they were truly prayers which came into being and were spoken by the spirit are filled with the teachings of the wisdom of god so that one may say of the things that they set forth who is wise and he shall understand these prayers and prudent and he shall know them 56 6 since therefore to treat of prayer is so weighty a task that it requires the illumination of the father for this very thing and the teaching of his first begotten word and the operation of the spirit that we may understand and speak worthily of so weighty a matter i pray as a man for i do not hold that i am able of my own self to treat of prayer before i begin to speak on the subject of prayer that the holy spirit may be vouchsafed to me so that a very full and spiritual word may be bestowed upon me and the prayers recorded in the gospels made plain let us now then begin the subject of prayer discussion on prayer in general chapters iii to xvii the words euche and proseuche chapters iii and iv iii i the word prayer euche occurs for the first time so far as my observation goes when jacob flying from the si matt 3 5 6 52 matt 11 9 53 1 sam 1 11 13 54 so koetschau emends the text of t 55 these psalms are numbered in the english bible 17 90 and 102 respectively 56 hos 14 9 244 origen wrath of his brother esau 5 departed into mesopotamia 5 in accordance with the counsel of isaac and rebecca 57 the pas sage runs as follows and jacob prayed a prayer saying if god the lord will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on and will bring me back again in safety to my father's house then shall the lord be unto me for god and this stone which i have set up for a pillar shall be unto me god's house and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee 58 59 2 here we should note that the word prayer euche which often has a different meaning from proseuche is used of a person who promises in prayer to do this or that if so be that he obtains these things from god but the term is also employed in its customary usage as for example we find it so used after the plague of frogs the second in order of the ten 60 pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said pray the lord for me and let him take away the frogs from me and my people and i will let the people go that they may sacrifice to the lord 61 and if anyone finds it hard to believe because the expression pray is pharaoh's that it has the usual sense as derived from prayer in addition to the sense previously mentioned he should note the passage which follows and moses said unto pharaoh appoint unto me when i shall pray for thee and for thy servants and for thy people that the frogs be destroyed from thee and from thy people and out of thy houses and remain in the river only 62 3 observe that in the case of the lice the third plague neither does pharaoh request a prayer to be made nor does moses pray 63 but in the case of the swarm of flies 64 the fourth he says pray therefore for me to the lord on which occa sion moses said i will go out from thee and i will pray unto god and the swarm of flies will depart from pharaoh and his servants and his people tomorrow 65 and a little further down 57 qf gen 27 41 45 58 gen 28 20 22 59 a lacuna of two lines occurs here in t which perhaps contained another example from the scriptures of prayer 60 a lacuna of two lines occurs here in t 3 which koetschau supplies after this manner when pharaoh commanded moses and aaron to pray to the lord for him that he should take away from him and his people the frogs which covered everything the passage is as follows ex 8 8 62 e x 8 9 63 ex 8 16 19 ex 8 20 32 65 ex 8 25 28 lxx on prayer 245 and moses went out from pharaoh and prayed unto god 66 and again while at the fifth and sixth plagues 67 neither did pharaoh request a prayer to be made nor did moses pray at the seventh pharaoh sent and called for moses and aaron and said unto them i have sinned this time the lord is righteous and i and my people are wicked pray therefore unto the lord and let there be an end to voices of god and hail and fire 68 and a little lower down moses went out of the city from pharaoh and spread abroad his hands unto the lord and the voices ended 69 why it is not said and he prayed as on the former occasions but he spread abroad his hands unto the lord must be considered more suitably at another time also at the eighth plague pharaoh says and pray unto the lord your god and let him take away from me this death and moses went out from pharaoh and prayed unto god 4 we have said that the word euche is often used not in the accustomed manner as for example with reference to jacob 71 also in leviticus the lord spake unto moses saying speak to the children of israel and thou shalt say unto them whosoever shall vow a vow as being an estimation of his soul to the lord the estimation of the male from twenty years old to sixty years old even his estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver by holy weight 72 and in numbers and the lord spake unto moses saying speak to the children of israel and thou shalt say unto them when either man or woman shall vow solemnly 73 a vow to make a separation for himself to the lord he shall be separated from wine and strong drink 74 and so forth with reference to him who is called a nazirite then a little lower down and he shall sanctify his head on that day in which he was sanctified to the lord for the days of his vow 75 and again a little lower down this is the law of him who hath vowed in whatsoever day he shall fulfil the days of his vow 76 and again a little lower down and after that he who hath vowed shall drink wine this is the law of him who hath vowed whosoever shall vow to the lord his gift as concerning his vow apart from whatsoever his hand shall find 66 ex 8 30 67 ex

the thing which the lord hath commanded when a man voweth a vow unto the lord or sweareth an oath by a bond or shall make a bond concerning his soul he shall not cause his word to become void he shall do according to all that pro ceedeth out of his mouth and if a woman voweth a vow unto the lord or bindeth herself by a bond being in her father's house in her youth and if her father heareth her vows and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul and if her father holdeth his peace all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall remain with her 78 and subsequently he lays down certain laws concerning such a woman the same meaning is to be found in proverbs it is a snare to a man rashly to sanctify anything of his own for after he hath vowed cometh repentance 79 and in ecclesiastes better is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest vow and not pay 80 and in the acts of the apostles there are with us four men which are under a vow of their own act 81 iv i it has seemed to me not unreasonable to distinguish first between the two meanings of the word euche in the scrip tures and likewise also of the word proseuche for indeed this word in addition to its common and customary frequently found usage also occurs in the unusual sense to us of euche in what is said concerning hannah in the first book of the king doms and eli the priest sat upon a seat by the door posts of the temple of the lord and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed proseuxato unto the lord and wept sore and she vowed a vow eucke and said o lord of hosts if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and not forget thine handmaid and wilt give unto thine handmaid the seed of a man then i will give him 77 num 6 20 21 78 num 30 1 4 79 prov 20 25 before this quotation there is a lacuna of one and three fifths lines in t which koetschau conjecturally fills with two other quotations from proverbs as follows a sacrifice of a peace offering is with me this day do i pay my vows 7 14 and a foolish son is the shame of his father unholy are the vows of a hired mistress 19 13 lxx and it is a snare 5 etc so eccl 5 5 i acts 21 23 see note for text 2 the text of koetschau is followed here on prayer 247 unto the lord as a gift all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head 83 2 here it would not be unconvincing to note the phrases prayed unto the lord 53 and vowed a vow and say that if she did the two things that is to say prayed unto the lord and vowed a vow perhaps the word prayed on the one hand occurs in the sense we usually give to the noun eucke while on the other hand she vowed a vow has the meaning of the word as it occurs in leviticus and numbers 84 for i wiu give him unto the lord as a gift all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head is not a proseuche in the proper sense of the term but rather that vow euche such as jephtha vowed in these words and jephtha vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou wilt indeed deliver the children of ammon into mine hand then it shall be that whoso ever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me when i return in peace from the children of ammon even he shall be the lord's and i will offer him up for a burnt offering 85 objections to prayer chapter v v i if it is necessary then after this to set forth as you have bidden us the plausible arguments first of those who think that nothing is effected by prayers and therefore affirm that it is superfluous to pray we shall not refuse to do this also accord ing to our ability employing the term prayer now in its simpler and more ordinary sense 86 this opinion is so dis reputable and lacking in distinguished supporters that prac tically no one can be found among those who admit providence and place god over the universe who rejects prayer it is the tenet either of those who are downright atheists and deny the existence of god or else of those who go as far as to accept the name of god but do away with his providence i would go further and say that the power that works in opposition 87 desiring to attach the most iniquitous opinions to the name of christ

up conjecturally thus for there are some who do not even accept prayer in this sense but rather make mock of those who pray and desire to do away com pletely with any kind of prayer whatsoever 87 gf ii thess 2 4 9 248 origen able to persuade some that they ought not to pray the cham pions of this opinion are those who completely reject objects of sense and use neither baptism nor eucharist and slanderously affirm that when the scriptures speak of praying they do not mean this but teach something with quite a different meaning 2 the following are the arguments conceivably of those who set at naught prayers that is to say of those who place god over the universe and say that there is a providence for there is no question now of examining the statements of those who reject god or providence altogether god knows all things before they be 88 and nothing which happens is known to him for the first time when it happens as if it were not known before this what need is there then to offer up a prayer to him who before it was prayed knows what we lack for the heavenly father knoweth what things we have need of be fore we ask him 89 it is reasonable that he who is the father and creator of the universe who loveth all things that are and abhorreth none of the things which he hath made 90 should dispense what is for the well being of each one without being prayed to just as a father does who protects his little ones and does not wait upon their requests either because they are unable to ask at all or because through ignorance they often wish to receive things that are clean contrary to their profit and advantage and we human beings are much further off from god than mere children are from the mind of their parents 3 now it is probable that the future is not only known before hand to god but also predetermined and that nothing comes to pass which has not been predetermined by him for ex ample if one were to pray that the sun should rise he would be regarded as a foolish fellow for requesting that something should happen through his prayer which would happen in any case without his prayer so also a man would be senseless to imagine that his prayer caused things to happen which would without doubt have taken place had he never prayed to give another example it would be unsurpassable folly for a man who was troubled by the scorching sun at the summer solstice to imagine that by his prayer the sun could be shifted back among the vernal constellations so that he might enjoy a temperate atmosphere in like manner for a man to suppose that by prayer he will escape from necessary happenings incidental to the human race would be to surpass every form of melancholy madness susanna 42 matt 6 8 wisdom of solomon 1 1 24 on prayer 249 4 moreover if the wicked are estranged from the womb 91 and the righteous man is separated from his mother's womb 92 and if the children being not yet even born neither having done anything good or bad that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth 93 it is said the elder shall serve the younger 94 in vain do we pray concerning remission of sins or the reception of the spirit of might 95 in order that we may have might for all things christ strengthening us 96 for if we are sin ners we are estranged from the womb 97 but if we were separated from our mother's womb 92 the best things will fall to our lot even though we should not pray what prayer did jacob offer before he was born that it should be prophesied of him that he shall prevail over esau and that his brother shall serve 98 him what sin did esau commit that he should be hated 99 before he was born or why does moses pray as we find in the eighty ninth psalm if god is his refuge before the mountains were established and the earth and the world formed i 2 5 moreover concerning all those that shall be saved it is recorded in the epistle to the ephesians that the father chose them in him in christ before foundation of the world that they should be holy and without blemish before him having foreordained them in love unto adoption as sons through christ unto himself 3 either then a man is one of those chosen before the foundation of the world and it is impossible for him to fall from this election 4 and therefore there is no need for him to pray or else he has not been chosen neither foreordained and it is in vain for him to pray even were he to pray ten thousand times he would not be heard for whom god foreknew them he also foreordained to be conformed to the image of the glory of his son and whom he foreordained them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified 5 why does josiah weary himself or wherefore when he prays does he take thought whether or no he shall be heard 6 when many generations previously it was prophesied of him by name and it was not 91 ps 58 3 92 gf gal 1 15 93 rom 9 ir 94 gen 25 23 rom 9 12 95 isa 11 2 96 cf phil 4

into sin it having been previously an nounced from the times of david that he would lose his office 3 and that another would take it in his stead 8 and since god is unchangeable and has predetermined everything that is and abides in what he has pre arranged it is obviously inconsistent to pray with the idea of altering his plan by prayer or of intreating him as one who has not pre arranged it but awaits each one's prayer this would be to make prayer the reason why god arranges what is fitting for him who prays and settles then what is deemed proper as if it had not already been foreseen by him 6 let the position be stated now in the very words of the letter you addressed to me they are as follows first if god knows the future beforehand and it must come to pass prayer is vain secondly if all things happen according to the will of god and if what is willed by him is fixed and nothing of what he wills can be changed prayer is vain it is useful i think to decide these points as a preliminary to solving the difficulties which cause insensibility in regard to prayer answer to these objections chapters vi to viii i vi 3 i of things that are moved 9 some derive from without that which moves them as for example things that are without life held together merely by their form and things that are moved by nature and soul which are moved now and then not as such but in a manner similar to things that are held together merely by their form for stones and pieces of wood which are cut out of the quarry or have lost the power of growing being held together merely by their form derive from without that which moves them moreover the bodies of living creatures and the produce of what has been planted when they are changed in position by something are not so changed qua living creatures or plants but similarly to stones and to pieces of wood which have lost the power of growth and even if they are moved in virtue of the fact that all bodies as they decay are in a state of flux this motion which they have is inseparably connected with their state of decay in the second place and distinct from the foregoing are things that are moved by their own inherent nature or soul 7 cf i kings 13 1 3 ps 109 7 8 acts 1 16 20 9 see note on prayer 251 which are said to be moved out of themselves 5 by those who use the words in their proper sense a third kind of movement is that which takes place in living creatures which is called move ment from within themselves but i think that the movement of rational beings is movement through themselves but if we take away from the living creature this movement from within itself it can no longer be conceived of as a living creature but it will be like either a plant which is moved merely by nature or a stone which is propelled by an external force but if a thing is inseparably connected with its own movement since we have called this movement through itself of necessity it must be rational 2 therefore they who hold that we have no free will 1 neces sarily take up an extremely foolish position in the first place that we are not living creatures and in the second that neither are we possessed of reason but moved as it were by some ex ternal moving force and therefore it can in no wise be said of us that we do what we are reckoned to do let a man pay partic ular attention to his own experience and see if it is not impudent for him to affirm that he does not of himself will or of himself eat or of himself walk or of himself assent to or accept any opinions of any sort or of himself dissent from others as false on the assumption that free will is not preserved a man cannot possibly adopt an attitude towards certain opinions supported though they may be ten thousand times by skilful and plausible arguments nor similarly can one adopt an attitude in regard to human affairs who takes up the position that nothing may be apprehended or who lives in suspense of judgment about everything whatsoever who does not rebuke his servant when he imagines negligence on the part of a slave and who is there who does not accuse a son for failing to render what is due to parents or does not blame and censure as guilty of a disgraceful act the adulterous wife for the truth forces and compels us in spite of thousands of plausible arguments to take action and to praise and to censure on the assumption that free will is safe guarded and deserves our praise or blame 3 if then free will is preserved with its countless tendencies towards virtue or vice and again towards what is fitting or what is not fitting it must needs be that this with all else has been known to god before it come to pass from the creation l and the foundation of the world 12 of what sort it shall be 10 see note n cf rom 1 20 12 cf matt 25 34 luke 11 50 heb 4 3 9 26 rev 13 8 17 8 252 origen and in everything which god arranges beforehand in accord ance with what he has seen concerning each act of free will he has so arranged it that that which is to happen in virtue of his providence and also that which is to come to pass in the train of future events will be the due result of each movement of the free will but the foreknowledge of god is not the cause of all future events or of future actions performed by us of our free will and mere motion even if for the sake of argument god were not to know the future we should not for that reason lose the power of accomplishing or willing this or that from fore knowledge however 13 it follows that each act of free will is adapted to such an arrangement of the whole as the settled order of the universe demands 4 if then each act of free will has been known to him it is a reasonable consequence that what has been foreseen by him is arranged by providence suitably for every single person and that it is understood beforehand 14 what so and so will pray for his kind of disposition the nature of his faith and what he desires to happen to him and this being understood before hand some sort of arrangement as this will accordingly have been made in the disposing of things i will hear this man who will pray intelligently for the very prayer's sake which he will pray but this man i will not hear either because he will be unworthy to be heard or because he will pray 14 for things which are neither profitable for him who prays nor proper for me to grant and for this prayer let us say of so and so i will not hear him but for that i will hear him if anyone is dis turbed by the thought that things have been determined by necessity because god who knows the future beforehand can not lie it should be said to such a one that this very thing is assuredly known to god that such and such a man does not assuredly and firmly desire what is better or that he will so will what is worse that he will be incapable of changing towards what is preferable and again i will grant this or that to this man who will pray because it is meet for me to do this for a man who will pray blamelessly and will not prove careless in the matter of prayer and when he shall pray for a certain time i will bestow this or that upon him exceeding abundantly above what he c asks or thinks 15 for it is meet for me to overpass him in good deeds and to supply him with more than he has been able to ask for moreover to such a one destined to become such as this i will send this ministering angel to be his fellow 13 reading rfv 14 adopting the reading of bentley is eph 3 20 on prayer 253 worker unto salvation from such a time onward and to continue with him until such a time to another destined to become greater than the first i will send this angel let us say who is more honourable than the other and as for this third who after embracing higher teaching is about to grow somewhat weaker and turn backwards to worldly things from him i will remove this mightier fellow worker and when he has departed some inferior power seizing the occasion to assault him in his slack ness will now deservedly come upon him and finding him given over and ready to sin will incite him to such and such sins 5 it is in some such way as this that he who orders before hand the universe will say amon will beget josiah who will not emulate the evil deeds of his father but will find the path that leads on to virtue and with the help of those that shall be his fellows will prove to be a good and worthy man and will break down the altar of jeroboam that was iniquitously built 16 and i know also that judas when my son has come to sojourn among mankind at the beginning will be a good and worthy man but afterwards will turn aside and fall into the sins that are common to man on account of which he will rightly suffer such and such things and this foreknowledge perhaps in respect of all things but certainly in respect of judas and other mysteries appertains also to the son of god who saw in his understanding of the future circle of events judas and the sins that would be committed by him so that with direct appre hension and before judas was born he said by the mouth of david o god pass not over in silence my praise 17 and so forth and knowing the future and what power 18 for godliness paul will have by myself he says 19 or ever i create the world or set my hand to begin to make it i will choose out him and as soon as he is begotten i will provide him with those powers that work together for the salvation of men separating him from his mother's womb 20 and permitting him at first in his youthful and ignorant zeal under the cloak of godliness to persecute 21 them that have believed on my christ and to keep the garments of them that were stoning my servant and martyr stephen 22 so that when this wanton outburst of youth is over starting again and changing for the better he should not glory before 23 me but rather say i am not meet to be 16 ii kings 23 15 cf ii kings 21 24 22 2 ps 109 1 is lit tension i the words he says are inserted by koetschau gal 1 15 21 acts 9 5 22 acts 7 59 22 20 231 cot 1 29 254 origen called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god 24 and perceiving the bounty that should come to him after the errors committed in youth under the cloak of godliness should say c by the grace of god i am what i am 2 and being pre vented by the conscience still with him of what he had done in the impulse of youth he will not be exalted overmuch by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations 26 that will be manifested to him by an act of bounty 33 vii and with regard to prayer concerning the rising of the sun 27 the following may be said even the sun has a certain free will inasmuch as it along with the moon praises god for he says praise ye him sun and moon 3 28 and it is clear that this also applies to the moon and consequently all the stars for he says praise him all ye stars and light 35 28 as therefore we have said 29 that god uses to the full the free will of each thing upon earth and has fittingly disposed them to meet a certain need of the things upon earth so it must be supposed with regard to the free will of the sun and moon and stars firmly fixed and wisely established that he has disposed all the host of heaven 3 30 and the course and movement of the stars harmoniously with the whole universe and if i do not pray in vain concerning some other thing that has free will much more is this true concerning the free will of the stars that circle in the heaven conformably to the safety of the whole universe and yet it must be said con cerning those on earth that certain impressions arising from attendant circumstances induce our instability or inclination to the worse 31 course so as to do or say such and such things but in regard to those in the heaven what impression can arise to divert or remove from that course which is beneficial to the universe any of those beings who possess a soul that is perfected by reason and alien to the influence of these impressions and make use of a body whose quality is etherial and absolutely pure viii i moreover it is not unreasonable to use some such illustration as this to encourage the practice of prayer and dis courage the neglect of prayer as it is not possible to beget a child without a woman and the possession of the necessary powers of begetting so a man may not obtain this or that un less he has prayed in such a way with such a disposition with 24 i cor 15 9 25 i cor 15 10 26 ii cor 12 7 27 see v 3 28 p s i4 8;3 29 see vi 3 30 deut 4 19 31 reading xslpov with bentley the mss have better course on prayer 255 such a belief and if before the prayer he has not lived in such a manner therefore vain repetitions ought not to be used 32 nor ought we to ask for little things 33 nor ought we to pray concerning earthly things nor ought we to come to prayer in wrath 34 and with agitated thoughts indeed without purity a man cannot secure the giving of himself to prayer 35 nor can he who prays obtain forgiveness of sins unless from his heart he forgives his brother 36 who has committed a fault and asks to receive pardon advantages of prayer chapters viii 2 to x 2 in my opinion benefit often accrues to him who prays as he ought or endeavours as far as in him lies to do so in the first place without doubt he whose mind is set on prayer is in some sense profited merely by the settled condition involved in praying when he has disposed himself to approach god and speak in his presence as to one who watches over him and is present for just as certain impressions and recollections of this or that sully the thoughts that have been involved in these im pressions in connection with the subjects of these recollections in the same way we must believe that it is profitable to recollect god in whom we have put our trust who perceives the secret movements of the soul when it composes itself to please him who trieth the hearts and searcheth out the reins 37 as one who is present and spies out and anticipates every purpose for if for the sake of argument he who sets his mind to prayer obtains no benefit beyond this it is to be observed that he who thus devoutly disposes himself at the time of prayer profits in no ordinary way and if this happens often how many sins it pre vents and how many good deeds it promotes is known by ex perience to those who have given themselves continually to prayer for if the calling to mind and reminiscence of an illus trious man who has profited by wisdom stirs us up to emulate him and often checks evil impulses how much more does the calling to mind of god the father of the universe together with prayer to him benefit those who are confident in themselves that they stand before and speak to god as one who is present and hears ix i what we have said must be proved from the divine scriptures on this manner he who prays ought to lift up holy 32 matt 6 7 33 see ii 2 34 i tim 2 8 35 cf i cor 7 5 36 matt 18 35 37 cf p s 7 9 jer 11 20 17 10 rom 8 27 rev 2 23 256 origen hands 5 38 by forgiving everyone who has sinned against him 39 having removed from his soul the feeling of wrath 38 and being angry with no one again in order that his mind may not be distracted by other thoughts he ought to forget during the time when he prays all things outside his prayer how could such a one be other than most blessed as paul teaches in his first epistle to timothy saying i desire therefore that the men pray in every place lifting up holy hands without wrath or disputings 40 moreover a woman especially when praying ought to be sedate and modest in soul and body reverencing god above all things when she prays having banished from the ruling reason every licentious and womanish recollection adorned not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly raiment but with the things which it becomes a woman pro fessing godliness to be adorned could anyone doubt i wonder that such a woman who has thus given herself to prayer would be manifestly blessed merely as a result of such an attitude as paul taught in the same epistle saying that women in like manner adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefastness and sobriety not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly raiment but which becometh women professing godliness through good works 41 2 the prophet 42 david also has much to say concerning the blessings that the saint has in prayer and it is not irrelevant to quote the following so that we may clearly see that the greatest benefits result from the attitude of and preparation for prayer considered simply by themselves of the man who has dedicated himself to god he says then unto thee have i lifted up mine eyes o thou that dwellest in the heaven 43 and unto thee have i lifted up my soul o god 44 when the eyes of the understanding are lifted up away from converse with earthly things and occupation with material impressions and when they are elevated so high that they can transcend created things and fix themselves solely upon the contemplation of god and of reverent and seemly intercourse with him who hears it must needs be that the eyes themselves derive the greatest bene fit when with unveiled face they reflect as a mirror the glory of the lord and are transformed into the same image from glory to glory 45 for they then partake of a kind of divine spiritual effluence as is indicated in the words the light of thy 58 i tim 2 8 39 cf matt 6 12 14 luke 1 1 4 40 i tim 2 8 k i tim 2 9 10 42 cf acts 2 30 43 ps i23h 44 ps 25 1 2 45 h cor 3 18 on prayer 257 countenance o lord was signed upon us 46 moreover when the soul is lifted up and follows the spirit and severs itself from the body and not only follows the spirit but also dwells in it as is indicated in the words unto thee have i lifted up my soul 5 47 it must needs be that laying aside the nature of a soul it becomes spiritual 3 and if to bear no malice is the greatest excellence as would appear from the prophet jeremiah when he says that the whole law is summed up in it i commanded not these things to your fathers when they were coming forth out of egypt but i commanded this 48 let no one bear malice against his neighbour in his heart 49 and if putting aside such malice in coming to prayer we observe the commandment of the saviour when he says if ye stand praying forgive if ye have aught against anyone 50 it is clear that in so doing as we stand to pray we have already obtained the greatest blessings x i the foregoing has been said on the supposition that even if no other result followed our prayers we gain the greatest blessings when we understand how to pray as we ought and when we cany this out and it is clear that he who thus prays will hear while he is yet speaking perceiving by the power of him who hears in heaven 51 the here i am having cast aside before he prayed all dissatisfaction concerning provi dence this is indicated in the words if thou take away from thee the yoke the putting forth of the hand and the word of murmuring 52 he who is well pleased with what happens has been set free from every kind of yoke nor does he put forth the hand against god when he orders what he wills for our training nor yet again does he murmur in his secret thoughts apart from an utterance that men can hear this murmuring is like that of wicked servants who do not openly cavil at their masters 3 orders thus do they murmur who do not dare audibly or whole heartedly to speak evil of providence for what has happened they wish as it were to escape the notice even of the lord of the universe as concerning those things at which they are displeased i think that this is the point of the words in the book of job in all these happenings did not job sin with his lips before god 53 it having been written of the previous trial 54 in all these happenings did not job sin before god 55 that 46 ps 4 6 47 ps 25 1 48 cf jer 7 22 23 49 zech 7 10 50 mark 11 25 i kings 8 30 52 isa 58 9 53 job 2 10 54 adopting with koetschau a slight change of text fi s job 258 origen this ought not to occur the saying in deuteronomy ordains beware that there be not a hidden word in thine heart a law less thing saying the seventh year is at hand 56 and so forth 2 he then that so prays receives such benefit that he is made more capable of union with him who has filled the world even the spirit 5357 of the lord and with him who has filled all the earth and the heaven who speaks thus through the prophet do not i fill heaven and earth saith the lord 5 and further by means of the purification mentioned above 59 he will participate in the prayer of the word of god who stands in the midst even of those who know him not and never fails the prayer of anyone but prays to the father along with him whose mediator he is for the son of god is the high priest 60 of our offerings and an advocate with the father 61 praying on behalf of those who pray pleading along with those who plead nevertheless he will not pray as on behalf of his own for those who do not pray continually through him nor will he be an advocate with god as on behalf of his very own for those who do not obey his teachings that one ought always to pray and not to faint 62 for it is said he spake a parable that one ought always to pray and not to faint there was in a city a judge 63 and so forth and in a previous passage and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three loaves for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey and i have nothing to set before him 64 and a little further on i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth 65 who is there who believes in the unerring utterance of jesus who would not be stirred up to instant prayer by his saying ask and it shall be given you for everyone that asketh receiveth 66 since the

over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine righteous persons which need no repentance 74 and so do also the souls of the saints who have fallen asleep before us this is indicated in the following references on the one hand raphael offered for tobit and sarah a reasonable sacrifice 75 to god 76 for after the prayer of both the prayer of both the scripture says was heard before the glory of the great raphael and he was sent to heal them both 77 and raphael himself when disclosing the mission that he had as an angel to them both by god's command says and now when thou didst pray and sarah thy daughter in law i did bring the memorial of your prayer before the holy one 78 and a little lower down i am raphael one of the seven angels which present the prayers of the saints 79 and go in before the glory of the holy one 80 certainly according to the word of raphael good is prayer with fasting and alms and righteousness 81 on the other hand jeremiah is represented in the books of the maccabees as of venerable age and exceeding glory so that wonderful and most majestic was the dignity around him 82 and stretching forth his right hand he delivered to judas a sword of gold 83 to whom bore witness another of the saints who have fallen asleep before us saying this is he who pray eth much for the people and the holy city jeremiah the prophet of god 84 2 since knowledge is disclosed to them that are worthy in this present life through a mirror and in a riddle but is revealed hereafter face to face 85 it is indeed absurd not to employ this analogy in thinking also of the other virtues for what has been prepared for in this life is properly perfected hereafter now according to the divine word one of the chiefest virtues is love to one's neighbour 85a and we must hold that the saints who have fallen asleep before us exercise towards those who are struggling in this life much more than do they who are compassed about with human weakness and are struggling in 74 luke

members suffer with it and if one member is honoured all the members rejoice with it 86 may be applied to those who love the brethren for it can be fittingly said also of the love that animates those outside this present life anxiety for all the churches who is weak and i am not weak who is made to stumble and i burn not 5 87 christ also acknowledges as concerning each of the saints that are sick that he is sick likewise and that he is in prison and that he is naked a stranger and an hungred and thirsty 88 what reader of the gospel does not know that christ refers to himself the happenings of the faithful and reckons their sufferings as his own 3 if angels of god coming to jesus ministered unto him 89 we must not suppose that this ministry of angels to jesus was only for the short period of his bodily sojourn among men since he is still in the midst of believers not as sitting at meat but as serving 90 how many angels therefore may there be ministering to jesus as he seeks to gather together the children of israel one by one 91 and muster them of the dis persion 92 and as he saves them that fear and call upon him 93 do not they even more than the apostles work together for the increase and multiplying of the church for certain rulers of the churches are called angels 94 by john in the apocalypse it is not in vain that the angels of god ascend and descend upon the son of man 95 being seen by those whose eyes have been enlightened with the light of knowledge 96 4 at the actual time of prayer being reminded by him who prays of what he needs the angels do all in their power to bring it to good effect in virtue of the general command which they have received let me use the following illustration to commend my thought on this matter suppose that a physician with a regard for righteousness was present when a sick man was pray ing concerning his health and that he knew how to heal the disease concerning which this man was offering up his prayer it is clear that the physician will be moved to heal the man who prayed perhaps not unreasonably supposing that this very thing was in the mind of god when he gave ear to the prayer of him who prayed to him for the removal of the disease or sup s i cor 12 26 s ii cor 11 28 29 gf matt 25 35 40 matt 4 11 9 luke 22 27 9i isa 27 12 gf john 7 35 10 16 11 52 93 cf acts 2 21 rom 10 12 13 94 rev 1 20 eta john 1 51 96 hos 10 12 lxx on prayer 26l pose that a man abundantly possessed of the means of livelihood and liberally disposed should hear the prayer of a poor man as he offers his petition to god for his needs it is plain that he too will fulfil for the poor man the substance of his prayer thus becoming a minister of the father's will who brings together to the same place at the time of the prayer both him who is about to pray and also him who is able to supply the request and un able because of his kindly disposition to disregard him who stands in need of such and such things 5 we need not suppose that these happenings when they occur come by chance since he who has numbered the hairs of the head 5 97 of the saints fittingly brings together at the time of the prayer to hear it him who is to act as the minister of the man who seeks the benefit from god and the man who truly stands in need in the same way we are to assume that the angels who watch over things and minister to god are at times brought into the presence of this or that man who is praying in order that they may join in the requests that he is making in his prayer and indeed the angel of each one and of the little ones in the church always beholding the face of the father which is in heaven 98 and gazing upon the divinity of him who created us joins in our prayers and co operates as far as possible in the objects for which we pray our whole life ought to be a prayer chapters xii to xiii i xii i moreover i hold that the words of the prayer of the saints are filled with power especially when praying with the spirit they pray with the understanding also 99 this last is like a light shining from the mind of him who is praying and going forth from his mouth to weaken by the power of god the spiritual poison injected by hostile powers into the reason of those who neglect prayer and do not observe the saying pray without ceasing 1 spoken by paul in conformity with the ex hortations of jesus it goes forth like a dart from the soul of the saint who prays sent on its way by knowledge and reason or by faith la and inflicts a wound for the destruction and overthrow of the spirits that are at enmity with god and desire to cast around us the bonds of sin 2 that man prays without ceasing 1 virtuous deeds or commandments fulfilled being included as part of prayer who 97 matt 10 30 luke 12 7 matt 18 10 i cor 14 15 i 1

practicable saying if we speak of the whole life of the saint as one great unbroken prayer of which prayer that which is commonly called prayer is a part this ought to be engaged in not less than three times every day as is clear from the case of daniel who when great danger hung over him prayed three times a day 3 peter also going up to the housetop about the sixth hour to pray when also he saw the vessel let down 4 from heaven let down by four corners 5 is evidence for the middle one of the three prayers while the one before it is spoken of by david in the morning shalt thou hear my 33 prayer 6 in the morning will i order my prayer unto thee and will look up 7 and the final one is indicated in the words the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice 8 indeed we shall not fittingly pass even the night time without this prayer for david says at midnight did i rise to give thanks unto thee for the judgments of thy righteousness 9 and paul as is stated in the acts of the apostles about mid night in company with silas at philippi was praying and singing hymns unto god so that even the prisoners listened to them 10 xiii i now if jesus prays and does not pray in vain ob taining through prayer what he asks for and perhaps he would not have received it without prayer which of us may neglect prayer for mark says in the morning a great while before day he rose up and went out and departed into a desert place and there prayed 11 and luke and it came to pass as he was praying in a certain place that when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him 12 and elsewhere and he continued all night in prayer to god 13 and john records his prayer thus these things spake jesus and lifting up his eyes to heaven he said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee 14 also the saying of the lord i knew that thou hearest me always 15 recorded by the same writer shows that praying always is always heard 2 i thess 5 17 s dan 6 10 4 perhaps

prayer 263 examples from scripture of answered prayer chapter xiii 2 2 but why need i tell the tale of those who have obtained the greatest blessings from god by praying as they ought each one can collect for himself from the scriptures many examples hannah ministered to the birth of samuel who was reckoned along with moses 16 when having no child she prayed in faith to the lord 17 hezekiah when as yet he was childless on learn ing from isaiah that he was about to die prayed 18 and has been given a place in the genealogy of the saviour 19 again when the people of the jews were about to be destroyed as a result of the plot of haman under a single decree the prayer with fasting of mordecai and esther was heard and it gave birth to the joyful day of mordecai 20 among the people 21 an addition to the feasts established by moses judith moreover when she had offered up a holy prayer overcame holophernes with the help of god and a woman of the hebrews single handed brought shame upon the house of nebuchadnezzar 22 also ananias azarias and misael in due answer to their prayer were sent a whistling dewy wind which prevented the flame of fire from exerting its power 23 and the mouths of the babylonians 5 lions in the den were stopped by the prayers of daniel 24 and jonah too did not despair of being heard from the belly of the great fish which swallowed him and when he came out from the belly of the fish he fulfilled what was lacking of his prophecy concerning the ninevites 25 similar prayers are also answered today chapter xiii 3 5 3 how many things could each of us tell of had we the de sire out of a thankful remembrance of benefits conferred upon us to offer praises to god concerning them souls that have long been sterile perceiving the barrenness of their own reason and the sterility of their own mind have by the holy spirit through persistent prayer conceived and given birth to saving words filled with perceptions of truth how many enemies have been destroyed when time and again myriads of a hostile power fought against us and sought to turn us from the divine faith then we took heart of grace because some trust in chariots and some in horses but we

nought the chief captain 28 of the adversary even that deceitful and plausible word which causes many to cower for fear even of those who are reckoned faithful for judith signifies praise what need is there also to speak of the numbers of those who have often encountered trials hard to overcome more searing than any flame and yet have suffered therein no hurt but have passed through them quite unharmed not even receiving in the ordinary way the harm of the smell of the enemy's fire 29 moreover how many wild beasts enraged against us even evil spirits and cruel men have they fallen in with and by their prayers often stopped their mouths so that they could not fasten their teeth upon those of us who have become the members of christ 30 often for each of the saints the lord hath broken the great teeth of the lions and they have melted away as water that passeth by 31 and we have often known those who had fled from the commandments of god and were swallowed up 32 of death which in days gone by had power over them who through repentance were saved from utter disaster because they did not despair of the pos sibility of salvation even when held fast in the belly of 33 death for death prevailing swallowed them up and god hath taken away again every tear from off every face 34 4 i consider that after giving a list of those who have been benefited by prayer it has been most necessary to add this in order to turn away from prayer for trivial and earthly things earnest seekers after spiritual life in christ and to exhort the readers of this book to the pursuit of things mystical of which the aforesaid were types for prayer concerning the spiritual and mystical blessings that we have indicated above is always and in every case brought to good effect by him who does not war according to the flesh 35 but who by the spirit mortifies the deeds of the body 36 those who seek out and establish the higher sense being preferred to those who appear to receive benefits prayed for according to the letter and in our case we must make it our endeavour that the soul 37 be not childless or barren as we listen to the spiritual law with spiritual ears so 26 ps 20 7 27 ps

putting aside childlessness or barrenness we may be heard as hannah and hezekiah were and may be delivered from enemies that plot against us even the spiritual forces of evil as mordecai and esther and judith were and since egypt is an iron furnace 3 38 being a symbol of every terrestrial place let every one who has escaped from the evil in human life and has not been set on fire by sin nor had his heart full of fire like a furnace give thanks no less than they did who were tried in a fire of dew 39 moreover let him who has been heard when in his prayer he said deliver not to the wild beasts the soul that hath acknowledged thee 40 and has suffered no hurt from the adder and the basilisk because christ has enabled him to tread upon them and has trampled under foot the lion and the dragon 41 and has used the good power given by jesus to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy 42 and has been in no wise harmed by such like let such a one give greater thanks than daniel did inasmuch as he has been delivered from more fearful and harmful wild beasts and further he who is persuaded of what great fish that which swallowed jonah is the type 43 and comprehends that it is the one spoken of by job let him curse it that curses the day who is ready to overpower the great fish 44 if at any time he should happen to find himself because of disobedience in the belly of the fish 45 let him repent and pray and he shall go forth therefrom and going forth and continuing to obey the commandments of god he shall be able in the kindness of the spirit 46 to prophesy to the ninevites that are perishing even now and become for them a cause of salvation if he is not displeased at the goodness of god and does not seek that his severity 47 should continue towards them that repent 5 the greatest thing that samuel is said to have wrought by prayer this in the spiritual sense it is possible for every one who is genuinely devoted to god to accomplish even now since he has become worthy of being heard for it is written and now stand and see this great thing which the lord doeth before your eyes is it not wheat harvest today i will call upon the lord and he will give thunder and rain then after a little and samuel called he says unto the lord and the lord gave thunder and rain that day 48 for to every saint and to the 38 dcut 4 20 dan 3 49 50 lxx o ps

your eyes and look on the fields that they are white already unto harvest he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal 48 verily at that season of harvest the lord doeth a great thing before the eyes of them that hear the erophets for when he who has been adorned with the holy pint has called unto the lord god gives from heaven thunder and rain that refreshes the soul so that he who was formerly in wickedness might greatly fear the lord 49 and the minister of the benefit wrought by god manifested as reverend and venerable in that his prayer is heard and elijah also opened the heaven after it had been shut up by the divine word for three years and six months 50 because of transgres sions and this good result follows always for everyone whom soever who through prayer receives the rain of the soul having been formerly deprived of it by reason of sin prayer a content b forms c to whom addressed chapters xiv to xvii xiv i having thus expounded the benefits which come to the saints from prayer let us go on to observe the saying ask for the great things and the little things shall be added unto you and ask for the heavenly things and the earthly things shall be added unto you 51 it is clear that all symbolical and typical things are small and earthly in comparison with the true and spiritual things and in all likelihood the divine word in exhorting us to imitate the prayers of the saints so that we may obtain in truth what they obtained in figure 52 indicates the heavenly and great things by means of matters con nected with earthly and little things saying ye who de sire to be spiritual ask in prayer so that having received them as heavenly ye may inherit the kingdom of heaven and as great ye may enjoy the greatest blessings but the earthly and little things of which ye are in want for bodily necessities the father will supply unto you in accordance with the measure of your need 2 since the apostle in the first epistle to timothy uses four nouns with reference to four matters closely connected with the subject of prayer it will be useful to quote his saying exactly and to see if we rightly take each of the four in its proper sense he 48a john 4 35 36 49 i sam 12 16 18 50 luke 4 25 c james 5 17 18 si see ii 2 52 a textual emendation has been adopted see note on prayer 267 says as follows i exhort therefore first of all that supplica tions prayers intercessions thanksgivings be made for all men 53 and so forth i consider then that a supplication is a petition offered with entreaty for the obtaining of something which a person lacks a prayer is offered in a dignified man ner with ascription of praise by some one concerning matters of importance an intercession is a request to god for certain things made by one who possesses more than usual confidence thanksgiving is an acknowledgement with prayer that bless ings have been obtained from god the greatness of that for which acknowledgement is made having been recognized or else the apparent greatness to him who has been benefited of the benefit that has been conferred upon him 3 examples of the first of these terms are as follows i the word of gabriel to zacharias when he had prayed as we may suppose concerning the birth of john which runs thus fear not zacharias because thy supplication is heard and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john 54 2 what is written in exodus in connection with the making of the calf after this manner and moses made sup plication before the lord god and said why doth thy wrath o lord wax hot against thy people which thou hast brought forth out of egypt with great power 55 3 in deuteronomy and i made supplication before the lord the second time as at the first forty days and forty nights i did neither eat bread nor drink water because of all your sins which ye sinned 56 4 in esther mordecai made supplication to god calling to mind all the works of the lord and he said lord lord king ruling over all things 57 and esther herself made sup plication to the lord the god of israel and said lord our king 5 4 examples of the second term for prayer are as follows i in daniel and azarias stood up and prayed thus and opened his mouth in the midst of the fire and said 59 2 tobit and i prayed in sorrow saying thou art righteous o lord and all thy works all thy ways are mercy and truth and thou judgest true and righteous judgment for ever but since they of the circumcision 61 have obelized the passage in daniel as i tim 2 1 54 luke 1 13 55 ex 32 11 s6 deut 9 18 57 esth 13 8 9 r.v and vulg 4 17 a b lxx 58 esth 14 3 r.v and vulg 4 7 t 1 lxx 59 dan 3 25 lxx eo tobit 3 1 2 ei acts 10 45 rora 4 12 gal 2 12 col 4 11 titus i:ia 268 origen not found in the hebrew and since they reject the book of tobit as uncanonical i will quote 3 from the first book of the kingdoms the passage about hannah and she prayed unto the lord and wept sore and she vowed a vow and said o lord of hosts if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine hand maid 5 62 and so forth 4 in habakkuk a prayer of habak kuk the prophet 3 with a song 63 o lord i have heard thy voice and was afraid o lord i perceived thy works and was as tounded in the midst of two living creatures thou shalt be known when the years draw nigh thou shalt be observed 64 this passage is an excellent illustration of the definition of prayer because it is offered with an ascription of praise by him who prayed 5 moreover in the book of jonah jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly and he said i called in my affliction unto the lord my god and he heard me out of the belly of hell thou heardest my crying even my voice thou didst cast me forth into the depths of the heart of the sea and the rivers were round about me 3 65 5 an example of the third term for prayer is to be found i with the apostle when with good reason he places prayer within our power but intercession 53 within the power of the spirit since he is greater and has boldness toward 5 66 him with whom he intercedes for we know not how to pray he says as we ought but the spirit himself maketh intercession exceedingly to god with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints 67 the spirit intercedes exceedingly and intercedes but we pray 2 intercession also seems to me to be involved in what is said by joshua about the sun standing still in gabaoth then spake joshua to the lord in the day when god delivered the amorites into the hand of israel when he destroyed them in gabaoth and they were destroyed from the face of the children of israel and joshua said let the sun stand still upon gabaoth and the moon in the ravine of edom 68 3 and in judges i think that samson intercedes when he said let my soul die along with the philistines when he leaned with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were therein and though it is not stated that joshua and samson interceded but that they spoke what they said i sam 1 10 11 gee note 64 hab 3 1 2 jonak an 2 3 66 qf i john 3 21 67 r omu 8 26 27 josk 10 12 j u dg 16 30 on prayer 269 seems to me to be intercession 55 which in my opinion is dif ferent from prayer if we use the terms in their proper sense an example of thanksgiving is to be found in our lord's words i thank 70 thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understand ing and didst reveal them unto babes 71 for exhomologoumai has the same meaning as eucharisto 6 now supplication and intercession and thanksgiving may not unsuitably be addressed to holy men also but two of them i mean intercession and thanksgiving not only to the saints but also to other men 72 while supplication is addressed to the saints only if for example a paul or a peter can be found in order that they may help us by making us worthy to receive the authority given to them to forgive sins 73 nevertheless if we wrong someone who is not a saint it is permitted to us conscious of our sin against him to supplicate such a one also that he may pardon our wrongdoing and if these may be addressed to holy men how much more may thanksgiving be made to christ who has wrought such benefits for us by the will of the father moreover we may intercede with him as stephen did when he said lord lay not this sin to their charge 74 and imitating the father of him who was epileptic 5 say i beseech thee lord have mercy either on my son 75 or on myself or on any one whomsoever xv i if we understand what prayer is perhaps we ought not to pray to anyone born of woman nor even to christ himself but only to the god and father of all to whom also our saviour prayed as we have mentioned before 76 and teaches us to pray 77 for when he heard teach us to pray he did not teach them to pray 78 to himself but to the father saying our father which art in heaven 79 and so forth for if as is shown elsewhere the son is different from the father in person and in subject 80 we must pray either to the son and not to the father or to both or to the father alone now everyone with out exception will agree that it would be most absurd to pray to the son and not to the father and that to maintain this would be contrary to revealed truth if we were to pray to both this would involve making our requests in the plural saying in our 70 ojioaoyou wu 71 matt 1 1 125 luke 10 21 72 text as emended by klostermann 73 qf matt 9 6 john 20 23 74

in itself incongruous nor can anyone give an instance from the scriptures of any persons using this mode of expression it remains therefore to pray only to god the father of all but not apart from the high priest 81 who was appointed 82 by the father with the talcing of an oath in accordance with the words he sware and will not repent him self thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek 83 2 when therefore the saints give thanks in their prayers to god they acknowledge his favours through christ jesus and as it is not fitting that a man who prays with due care should pray to him who prays but rather to him whom our lord jesus has taught us to call upon in prayer even the father so also no prayer should be offered to the father apart from him as he himself shows us clearly when he says verily verily i say unto you if ye shall ask anything of my father he will give it you in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be fulfilled 84 for he did not say ask me nor yet ask the father simply but if ye shall ask anything of my father he will give it you in my name for until jesus had given this teaching no one had asked the father in the name of the son it was a true saying of jesus hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name and true also the saying ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be fulfilled 3 but if anyone thinking that he ought to pray to christ himself and confused by the meaning of the word worship should bring forward to us the saying let all the angels of god worship him 85 admittedly in deuteronomy spoken of christ we should say to him that the church also named jerusalem by the prophet is said to be worshipped by kings and queens who have become her nursing fathers and mothers the passage is as follows behold i lift up mine hand to the nations and will lift up mine ensign to the isles and they shall bring thy sons in their bosom and will lift up thy daughters upon their shoulders and kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their queens thy nursing mothers they shall worship thee 86 with their face to the earth and lick the dust of thy feet and thou shalt know that i am the lord and shalt not be ashamed 87 4 without

text of this passage see note on prayer 271 good none is good save one even god the father 89 might also say why dost thou pray to me it is right to pray to the father alone to whom i also pray as you learn from the holy scriptures for you ought not to pray to him who was appointed high priest 90 on your behalf by the father and who received from the father the office of advocate 91 but rather through the high priest and advocate who e can be touched with the feeling of your infirmities and e hath been in all points tempted as you are yet because of the gift bestowed on me by the father tempted without sin 92 learn therefore how great a gift you have received from my father having received through regeneration 93 in me the spirit of adoption 94 that you may be called sons of god 95 for you have read the saying addressed to the father that was spoken by me concerning you through david i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation will i sing thy praise 96 it is not reasonable that those who have been deemed worthy to have one 97 father with him should pray to a brother therefore your prayer ought to be offered to the father alone with me and through me xvi i hearing then jesus saying these things let us pray to god through him all saying the same thing and in no way divided concerning the manner of prayer are we not divided if some of us pray to the father others to the son those who pray to the son either with the father or apart from the father sin with great simplicity through ignorance of the sub ject due to lack of examination and inquiry let us pray then as to god let us make intercession as to a father let us make supplication as to a lord let us give thanks as to god and father and lord and in no wise as to the lord of a slave for the father might rightly be reckoned both as lord of the son and lord of them who have become sons through him as he is not the god of the dead but of the living 98 so he is not the lord of ignoble slaves but of those who are ennobled who at the beginning because of their infancy 99 lived in fear but afterwards in love serve a happier servitude than that of fear 1 for it is in the soul and to him alone who sees the heart that the marks of god's slaves and of his sons are manifest 89 mark 10 18 90 gf heb 8 3 cf i john 2 1 92 heb 4 15 93 cf i peter 1 3 23 94 rom 8 15 95 rom 8 14 gal 3

god for earthly and little things disregards the command to ask for heavenly and great things from god who knows not to grant anything earthly or little if anyone offers as an objection the things pertaining to the body that were bestowed upon the saints as the result of prayer and also the evangelical saying 2 which tells us that earthly and little things are added to us the following reply may be made to him if some one were to give us a bodily object of any kind whatsoever we should not say that such a one bestowed upon us the shadow of the bodily ob ject for in giving the bodily object he did not design to give two things the object and its shadow but the design of the giver was to give the bodily object it followed however that with the gift of the object we also received its shadow similarly when our understanding has grown in stature and we note which are the gifts which are pre eminently given us by god we shall say that bodily things are the most natural accompani ments of the great and heavenly spiritual gifts 3 given to each of the saints to profit withal 4 either according to the proportion of faith 5 or even as the giver wills 6 and he wills wisely even

and to some no shadow is given at all 12 students of the problems connected with sun dials and with the relation of the shadow to the luminous body are clearly aware of what happens according to latitude 13 for example in some latitudes the gnomons give no shadow at a certain season in others the shadow is short so to speak and in others again longer than in others it is not strange then if the design of him who bestows pre eminent gifts grants them in accordance with certain ineffable mystic analogies to suit the recipients and the times when these pre eminent gifts are made sometimes no shadows at all follow for the recipients sometimes there are shadows not of all the gifts but of a few sometimes they are smaller in comparison with the rest sometimes larger accom pany others if a man who seeks the rays of the sun has this indispensable thing he is neither rejoiced nor grieved by the presence or absence of bodily shadows when having been en lightened he is either deprived of the shadow or has more or less of the shadow so also if spiritual things are present to us and we are being enlightened by god in the complete possession of what is truly good we shall not waste words about the paltry thing which is the shadow for all material and bodily things of whatever kind they may be have the value of an unsub stantial and feeble shadow and can in no way be compared with the saving and holy gifts of the god of the universe what sort of comparison can there be between bodily riches and the riches in all utterance and in all 14 wisdom who that is not a madman would compare health of flesh and bones with a healthy mind and a robust soul and a balanced reason when all these are duly ordered by a god given reason they cause bodily sufferings to become a trifling scratch so to speak and indeed in my opinion less than a scratch 11 see note 12 so bentley emends 3 reading jcat iara for crwfiara 14 i cor 1 5 a.g 1 8 274 origen 2 he who has perceived what the beauty of the bride is whom the bridegroom 15 who is the word of god loves in the full bloom of the super celestial and super mundane beauty of the soul will be ashamed to honour even with the same name of beauty the bodily beauty of woman or boy or man flesh does not contain beauty in the true sense of the word seeing that all of it is shameful for all flesh is as grass and the glory 55 of it which appears in the so called beauty of women and children has been compared according to the word of the prophet to a flower as follows all flesh is as grass and all the glory of it is as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower falleth away but the word of the lord remaineth for ever 16 again who would properly continue to use the term noble birth as it is commonly employed by men once he has perceived the noble birth of the sons of god when the mind has contemplated a kingdom of christ that cannot be shaken 17 it cannot but despise as of no worth or account every kingdom upon earth when a man sees as clearly as he can in so far as the human mind still imprisoned in the body is capable the host 18 of angels and the commanders among them of the powers of the lord 19 and archangels and thrones and dominions and principalities and powers 20 and when he comprehends that he can attain to equal honour with them 21 from the father it must needs follow that even though he be feebler than a shadow he will despise by comparison as utterly mean and of no account the things that foolish men set great store by and should he be offered all these things he will dis dain them so that he may not fail to attain unto the true prin cipalities and diviner powers we must pray therefore we must pray concerning the pre eminently and truly great and heavenly blessings and as concerning the shadows that accompany these pre eminent blessings we must commit this matter to god who knows before we ask him what things we have need of 22 for the perishable body discussion of the lord's prayer chapters xviii to xxx xviii i enough has been said by us in the foregoing ex amination of the problem of prayer according to the grace is a john 3 29 16 isa 40 6 8 n heb 12 28 is luke 2 13 josh 5 14

judge now we shall proceed to the next task for we desire to consider the prayer outlined by the lord with what power it has been filled the texts of the lord's prayer chapter xviii 2 3 2 and first of all we must note that matthew and luke might seem to most people to have recorded the same prayer provid ing a pattern of how we ought to pray but the text of matthew runs as follows our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so on earth give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors and bring us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one 24 luke's text on the other hand runs thus father hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come give us day by day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us and bring us not into temptation 25 3 but we must reply to those who take this view in the first place that the words although they have some resemblances nevertheless appear to differ in other points as our investigation of them will establish and in the second place that it cannot be the same prayer which was spoken on the mountain to which seeing the multitudes he went up when having sat down his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them 26 for this prayer is found recorded in matthew in the context of the recital of the beatitudes and the command ments which follow and that which as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased was spoken to one of his dis ciples who had asked to be taught to pray even as john also taught his disciples 27 for how can it be possible that the same words were spoken by themselves apart from any previous in quiry and also delivered at the request of a disciple perhaps however someone will say to this that the prayers are virtually the same and were spoken as one prayer on one occasion in an extended address and on another to one of the disciples who had made the request probably because he was not present when the prayer recorded in matthew was spoken or because he had not retained what was said perhaps however it is better to take the view that the prayers are different though 23 i cor 3 10 24 matt 6 9 13 25 luke 11 2 4 26 matt 5 1 2 27 luke 11 1 276 origen they have some parts common we searched also the gospel of mark in case the record of something equivalent there should escape us but we found no trace whatever of the prayer in it the introduction to the prayer in matthew chapters xix to xxi xix i since as we said above 28 he who prays must first be settled and disposed in a certain manner and then afterwards so pray let us consider the words that were uttered by the saviour on this subject before the prayer as it is given in matthew they are as follows when ye pray ye shall not be as the hypocrites for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have received their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thine inner chamber 3 and having shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall recompense thee and in praying use not vain repetitions as the gentiles do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be not therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him after this manner therefore pray ye 29 2 our saviour in many places clearly ranks vainglory as a deadly passion as he has done also here when he deters us from acting at the time of prayer as hypocrites do for it is to act the hypocrite to wish to pride oneself before men for piety or liberality those who remember the saying how can ye be lieve which receive glory of men and the glory that cometh from the only god ye seek not 30 must despise all glory from men even though it be reckoned to have been given for a good cause and must seek the true glory that is properly so called which comes from him alone who glorifies him who is worthy of glory in a manner fitting to himself and beyond the deserts of the recipient of glory and that which would be reckoned as good in itself and is reckoned to be praiseworthy is sullied when we do it that we may have glory of men 31 or that we may be seen of men 32 therefore no recompense from god follows us for this for every word of jesus is true 33 and if one may use a forced expression is truer when it is spoken with his accustomed oath he says of those who for the sake of vainglory seem to do good to their neighbour or pray in the synagogues and the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men 5 the same thing verily i say unto you they have received 2 viii 2 x

received these he was no longer able to obtain them after this present life similarly he who has re ceived his own reward 36 either for giving something to someone or for his prayers inasmuch as he did not sow unto the spirit but unto the flesh shall reap corruption but shall not reap eternal life 37 now that man sows unto the flesh who in the synagogues and the streets that he may have glory of men doeth alms with a trumpet before him 38 or he who loves to stand and pray in the synagogues and corners of the streets that he may be seen of men 39 and be reckoned as pious and holy by those who see him 3 moreover everyone who travels along the wide and broad way that leadeth to destruction 40 which has nothing clear or straight but is altogether full of twists and corners for its straightness has been very much broken into curves stands in it not otherwise than he 41 who prays in the corners of the streets 42 through love of pleasure frequenting not one but several streets where are to be found those who are dying like men 43 because they have fallen from their deity who praise and count happy those in the streets who are wont to commit iniquity in their company and at all times there are many who in their praying are manifestly lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god 44 in the midst of banquets and at carousals be having drunkenly in prayer truly standing in the corners of the streets and praying 45 for everyone who lives according to pleasure having loved the broad path has fallen from the narrow and straitened way 46 of jesus christ a way with not the slightest bend and absolutely no corners at all xx i if there is a difference between the church and the synagogue the church properly so called not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but being

by a cen turion who did this in the times before the sojourn with us of jesus when as yet witness had not been borne to him that he had such faith as the son of god found not in israel si he who loves to pray in the synagogues is not far from the corners of the streets 52 but the saint is not such a one for he does not love iaet to pray but rather has a deep con cern ayatra to do so and not in synagogues but in churches and not in corners of streets but in the straightness of the narrow and straitened way 53 nor yet again that he may be seen of men 54 but that he may appear before the lord god 55 for he is a male person perceiving the accept able year of the lord 56 and keeping the commandment which says three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the lord thy god 55 2 we must pay careful attention to they may be seen 54 since nothing that is seen is good 57 being in appearance as it were and not truly deceiving the imagination and not forming a distinct or true image the actors of a drama in the theatre are not what they say they are or what they appear to be in accordance with the character they assume similarly those who simulate in appearance an impression of the good are not righteous but are actors of righteousness and are themselves acting in their own theatre the synagogues and the corners of the streets 52 but he who is not an actor and on the contrary puts aside everything that is not his own and prepares to de light himself in a place that is greater and far surpasses any of the theatres mentioned above enters into his own inner chamber shutting 58 himself in upon the riches laid up in store 59 the treasure of wisdom and knowledge 60 and never bending outside nor gaping at the things outside he shuts every door of the faculties of sense so that he may not be en ticed by the impressions of sense and their image may not pene trate into his mind thus he prays to the father who does not flee from or abandon such a secret place 61

evident that if indeed we pray thus we shall make intercession not only with the righteous god but also with the father as one who is not absent from his sons but is present in our secret place and watches over it and increases what is in the inner chamber if we shut the door 55 of it xxi i in praying however do not let us use vain repetitions 66 but rather let us speak to god now we use vain repetitions when we fail to examine for blemishes either ourselves or the words of prayer we offer up and so speak of corrupt deeds or words or thoughts which are mean and blame worthy and alien from the incorruptibility of the lord indeed he who uses vain repetitions in praying is actually in a worse case than those who frequent the synagogues of whom we spoke above and in a more grievous condition than they who stand in the corners of the streets 67 since he does not pre serve a trace of even a pretence of good according to the text of the gospel they who alone use vain repetitions are the gen tiles 68 who have no notion whatever of great and heavenly requests but offer up every prayer for bodily and outward things therefore he who requests things of below from him who dwells in the heaven and above the highest heaven even the lord is like unto a gentile using vain repetitions 2 it seems indeed that he who speaks much uses vain repetitions and he who uses vain repetitions speaks much for no material or bodily thing is single but every one of them though reckoned single is split up and cut in pieces and divided into several parts having lost its unity virtue is one vice is many truth is one falsehood is many the wisdom of god is one the wisdoms of this world and of the rulers of this world which are coming to nought 69 are many the word of god is one those who are estranged from god are many there fore no one shall escape transgression for much speaking 70 and no one though thinking that he shall be heard for his much speaking can be heard thereby and so our prayers must not be like unto the vain repetitions or much speaking of the gentiles 71 or to whatever else they may do after the likeness of the serpent 7 for the god of the saints being a father

need of 3 73 since they are things worthy of the father's know ledge but if a man knows not god and knows not the things of god he knows not what things 35 he has need of for the things which he thinks he has need of are entirely wrong on the other hand he who contemplates what higher and holier things he lacks will attain to the objects of his contemplation which are known by god and have been known to the father or ever the request was made having said so much on the passage which precedes the prayer in the gospel according to matthew let us now go on to see the meaning of the prayer itself our father which art in heaven chapters xxii and xxiii xxii i our father which art in heaven 74 it is worth while examining with unusual care the old testament as it is called to see if it is possible to find anywhere in it a prayer in which someone calls god father though we searched to the best of our ability up to the present we have found none we do not mean that god is never called father or that those who were wont to believe in god are never styled sons of god but that we have not yet succeeded in finding in a prayer that confident affirmation in styling god as father which was made by the saviour that god is called father and that those who have drawn nigh to the word of god are called sons may be seen from many passages as for example in deuteronomy thou hast forsaken the god who begat thee and hast forgotten the god who nurtureth thee 75 and again is not he thy father that hath bought thee and hath made thee and established thee 76 and again sons in whom is no faith 77 and in isaiah i have begotten and brought up sons but they have rejected me 78 and in malachi a son will honour his father and a servant his master and if i am a father where is mine honour and if i am a master where is my fear 79 2 therefore even though god is spoken of as father and those begotten by the word of faith in him as sons it is not possible to find in the ancients at any rate a firm and unchange able affirmation of sonship for example the passages we have quoted show that those called sons are blameworthy since according to the apostle while the heir is a child he diflereth 73 matt 6 8 74 matt 6 9 75 deut 32 18 deut 23 6 77 deut 32 20 78 isa i 2 x 6 on prayer 28l nothing from a bond servant though he is lord of all but is under guardians and stewards until the term appointed of the father 80 but the fulness of the time 81 arrived 82 at the sojourn of our lord jesus christ when those who desire it receive the adoption of sons 83 as paul teaches in the follow ing words tor ye received not the spirit of bondage unto fear but ye received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father 84 and in the gospel according to john but as many as received him to them gave he the right to become children of god even to them that believed on his name 85 and because of this spirit of adoption we learn in the general epistle of john as concerning those who are begotten of god that who soever is begotten of god doeth no sin because his seed abideth in him and he cannot sin because he is begotten of god 86 3 nevertheless if we consider the meaning of the words when ye pray say father 87 as it is written in luke we shall hesitate j ye are not true sops q address him by this title lest perchance in addition to our sins we should incur the charge of impiety also what i mean is something like this paul says in his former epistle to the corinthians no man can say jesus is lord but in the holy spirit and no man speaking in the spirit of god saith jesus is anathema 88 he uses holy spirit and spirit of god as synonymous terms but what the mean ing is of saying in the holy spirit jesus is lord is by no means clear for countless hypocrites and numbers of heretics use this title and sometimes even demons when they are overcome by the power that is in the name no one will dare to maintain that any of these says jesus is lord in the holy spirit nor could they even be shown to say jesus is lord since those only from the heart say jesus is lord who while serving the word of god and while engaged in doing anything whatsoever call none other lord save him if it be such that say jesus is lord it may be that everyone who anathematizes the divine word in transgressing by his own actions cries out jesus is anathema therefore just as such a one says jesus is lord and he of an opposite mind jesus is anathema so also whosoever is begotten of god and doeth no sin through partaking of the seed 89 of god which turns him aside from every sin says by his deeds our father which art in heaven 9q so gal 4 1 2 i gal 4 4 82 reading 3 gal 4 5 84 rom 8 15 85 john 1 12 6 i john 3 9 luke 1 1 2 88 i cor 12 3 8j i john 3 9 matt 6 9 282 origen the spirit himself bearing witness with their spirit that they are children of god and his heirs and joint heirs with christ since suffering with him they have good hope to be also glorified with him 91 and in order that such may not only half say our father a the heart also which is the fountain and source of good works in conjunction with the works believeth unto righteousness and in harmony with them the mouth maketh confession unto salvation 92 4 every deed and word and thought of theirs having been formed by the only begotten word 93 after his likeness imitates the image of the invisible god 94 and is after the image of the creator 95 who maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust 96 so that there is in them the image of the heavenly 97 who is himself the image of god 94 the saints therefore being an image of an image that image being the son acquire an impression of 98 sonship becoming conformed not only to the body of the glory 99 of christ but also to him 1 who is in the body 2 they become conformed to him who is in the body of the glory 99 as they are transformed by the renewing of the mind 3 if such persons in everything say our father which art in heaven 4 evidently he that doeth sin as john says in his general epistle is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning 5 and as the seed of god remaining in him that is begotten of god 6 becomes for him who has been conformed 7 to the only begotten word 93 the cause that he cannot sin 6 so in everyone that doeth sin the seed of the devil 5 is present and so long as it is inherent in the soul pre vents him who has it from being able to perform right actions but since to this end was the son of god manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil it is possible by the dwelling in our soul of the word of god when the works of the devil have been destroyed 8 for the evil seed implanted in us to be done away with and for us to become children of god 9 5 do not let us think that we are taught to say actual words at a certain fixed time of prayer if we understand what has 9i rom 8 16 17 9ia matt 6 9 92 r m 10 10 w john 1 14 18 94

be on earth but in every way in heaven 15 which is the throne 14 of god for the kingdom of heaven is seated in all those who bear the image of the heavenly 15 and therefore are themselves heavenly xxiii i but when the father of the saints is said to be in heaven we are not to suppose that he is circumscribed in bodily fashion and dwells in heaven 12 otherwise if the heaven contained him god would be found less than because contained by the heaven but we must believe that by the in effable power of his godhead all things are contained and held together by him and speaking generally sayings which taken literally are supposed by simple folk to assert that god is in a place must instead be understood in a manner that befit grand and spiritual conceptions of god such are the following in the gospel according to john now before the feast of the passover jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end 16 and a little further on knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he came forth from god and goeth unto god 17 and later on ye heard how i said to you i go away and i come unto you if ye loved me ye would have rejoiced because i go unto the father 18 and again later on but now i go unto him that sent me and none of you asketh me whither goest thou 19 if these words are to be taken in a local sense it is obvious that we must do the same with jesus an swered and said unto them if a man love me he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him 20 2 these sayings do not conceive of a local departure of the father and the son to him who loves the word of jesus nor are they to be taken in a local sense but the word of god con descending for our sakes and being humbled 21 as concerning his own dignity when he is among men is said to depart out of this world to the father 22 in order that we also may behold 10 ch xii 11 i thess 5 17 12 matt 6 9 is phil 3 20 i 4 cf isa 66a i cor 15 49 16 john 13 1 17 john 13 3 is john 14 28 i john 16 5 20 john 14 23 2 phil 2

at the end of the gospel according to john touch me not for i am not yet ascended unto the father 28 let us seek to conceive of it in a mystical sense the ascent of the son unto the father 27 when conceived of by us with holy insight in a manner befitting deity is an ascent of the mind rather than of the body 3 i think it necessary 29 to consider carefully these sayings in connection with the words our father which art in heaven 30 in order to remove a mean conception of god held by those who consider that he is locally in heaven and to prevent anyone from saying that god is in a place after the manner of a body from which it follows that he is a body a tenet which leads to most impious opinions namely to suppose that he is divis ible material corruptible for every body is divisible material corruptible else let them tell us that instead of indulging in vain imaginings they claim to conceive clearly how its nature can be other than material since however before the bodily sojourn of christ many of the scriptures 31 seem to say that god was in a place after a bodily manner it does not appear to me to be inappropriate to quote a few passages from them also in order to take away all doubtfulness 32 from those whose peculiar ity it is so far as they can to confine god who is over all in a small and limited space and first in genesis adam and eve he says heard the voice of the lord god walking in the after noon in the garden and adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the lord god in the midst of the trees of the garden 33 we shall ask those who are unwilling to enter into the treasures of the passage and indeed do not even make a beginning by knocking at their door 34 if they can maintain that the lord god who filleth heaven and earth 35 who as they suppose uses in bodily fashion heaven as his throne and the earth as the footstool of his feet 36 is bounded by a place so small in 23 col i:ig 2 9 24 phil 2 7 25 col 2iio 26 john 16 5 27 john 14 12 28 28

and earth that what they suppose is a bodily garden is not completely filled by god but is so much larger than he that it contains him as he walks a sound being heard from the treading of his feet 37 and it is still more absurd according to them that adam and eve in awe of god because of their transgression should hide them selves from the presence of the lord god in the midst of the trees of the garden 37 for it is not even said that they so wished to hide themselves but that in very truth they were hidden and how according to them can god ask adam saying where art thou 38 4 we have treated these matters at length in our com mentaries on genesis however so that we may not now pass over in complete silence so important a problem it will be sufficient to call to mind the saying of god in deuteronomy 39 i will dwell in them and walk in them 40 his walking in the saints is of the same kind as his walking in the garden every sinner hiding himself from the presence of god 41 and avoiding his visitation and shunning open speech with him so also cain went out from the presence of god and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden 42 as therefore he dwells in the saints so also in heaven whether in every saint bearing the image of the heavenly 43 or in christ in whom are all the lights 44 and stars 45 of heaven who are being saved 46 or else he dwells there because of the saints in heaven in accordance with 47 the saying unto thee did i lift up mine eyes who dwellest in the heaven 48 and the passage in ecclesiastes be not hasty to utter any thing before god for god is in heaven above and thou upon earth below 49 makes a deliberate distinction between those who are still in the body of humiliation 50 on the one hand and the angels and holy powers who are uplifted by the aid of the word 51 or christ himself on the other for it is not inappropriate that he is properly the throne of the father allegorically called heaven while his church given the name of earth is

sayings which are considered to show that god is in a place in order that we may persuade the reader by every means accord ing to the power given unto us 53 to understand the divine scripture in a loftier and more spiritual sense whenever it seems to teach that god is in a place and it was fitting to examine these passages in connection with the words our father which art in heaven 54 words which separate the essence of god from all created things for to those who do not partake of his essence there appertains a certain divine glory and power and so to speak an effluence of his deity 55 hallowed be thy name chapter xxiv xxiv i hallowed be thy name 56 he who prays these words either shows that the object of his prayer has not been achieved or else having attained it he asks that a result not per manent should be maintained 57 this is evident enough from the passage here in which according to matthew and luke we are commanded to say hallowed be thy name 56 as if the name of the father were not yet hallowed how someone might say can a man ask that the name of god be hallowed as if it had not been hallowed what is the name of the father and what is its hallowing let us consider these questions 2 a name then is a compendious appellation manifesting the individual quality of the being named for example paul the apostle has a certain individual quality a quality of soul which makes it of a certain kind a quality of mind which makes him capable of contemplating certain kinds of things a quality of body which makes it of a certain kind the individuality of these qualities which is incommunicable to another for no be ing is exactly similar to paul is indicated by the name paul but in the case of men since their individual qualities as it were alter their names also according to scripture alter suit ably when the quality of abram changed he was called abraham 58 and when simon's he was named peter 59 and when saul's the persecutor of jesus he was called paul 60 in the case of god however who is in himself unchangeable and 53 eph 3 20 54 matt 6 9 55 qf wisdom of solomon 7 25 5 matt 6 9 luke 1 1 2 57 the text of this passage is uncertain see note 58 gen 17 5 59 j onn 11 q 2 c mark 3 16 acts 9 4 5 13 9 on prayer 287 remaining always unalterable there is always one name by which as it were he is called the i am spoken of in exodus 61 or something of similar import since then we all have some conception of god and form some notions of whatever kind about him but not all conceive what he is for these are few and if i may say so fewer than these few are those who compre hend his holiness in all things we are rightly taught that the idea within us of god is holy in order that we may see the holiness of him as he creates foresees judges chooses forsakes receives turns away from deems worthy of honour punishes each one according to his deserts 3 in these and in similar expressions if i may say so the individual quality of god is characterized what in my opinion is called the name of god 55 in the scriptures in exodus thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain 62 in deuteronomy let my speech be waited for as the shower let my words descend as the dew as the rain upon the young grass and as the copious rain upon the herb 63 for i called upon the name of the lord 64 in psalms they shall remember thy name in all generations 65 he who connects the idea of god with things that are not fitting takes the name of the lord god in vain and he who is able to utter speech as the rain which works together with them that hear for the fruitfulness of their souls addressing words full of encouragement like dew and by the power of edification bringing upon the hearers a most profitable shower of words or a most effectual and copious rain can do these things because of the name therefore 66 when a man perceives his need of god the perfecter he calls by him self upon him who is truly the supplier of the above mentioned blessings and everyone who clearly sees also the things of god remembers rather than learns them even though he may seem to hear them from some one or may think that he discovers the mysteries of godliness 4 even as he who prays ought to note what has been said here and ask that the name of god be hallowed so also it is said in psalms let us exalt his name together 67 the prophet 68 commanding us in full accord with the same mind and the same opinion to haste unto the true and lofty knowledge of the distinctive being of god for this is to exalt the name 6i ex 3 14 62 ex 20 7 63 see note 64 deut 32 2 3 65 ps 45 7 66 see note 67 p s 34 3 68 so koetschau emends cf acts 2 30 and also ix 2 above 288 origen of god together when a man partaking of an effluence of deity exalts 69 that very power of god of which he has partaken inasmuch as he has been raised up by god and has conquered his foes who are unable to exult over his fall this is indicated in the twenty ninth psalm by the words i will exalt thee o lord because thou didst raise me up and not make my foes to rejoice over me 70 and a man exalts god when he has dedicated for him a house within himself as the title of the psalm has it a psalm a song at the dedication of the house a psalm of david 71 5 further with regard to hallowed be thy name and the words in the imperative mood that follow it is to be said that the translators also frequently use the imperative instead of the optative mood as for example in the psalms let the deceitful lips be dumb which speak iniquity against the righteous man 72 instead of may they be and let the extortioner seek out all that he hath let him have no helper 73 in the one hundred and eighth concerning judas for the whole psalm is a request concerning judas that this and that may happen to him but tatian failing to understand that let there be does not always indicate the optative but sometimes the im perative formed a most impious conception concerning him who said let there be light 74 even god as if he were praying rather than commanding that there should be light since as he expresses his godless thought god was in darkness to him we must say how will he take the words let the earth bring forth grass for pasture 75 and let the water under the heaven be gathered together 76 and let the waters bring forth creeping things creatures that have life 77 and let the earth bring forth a living creature 78 does god really pray that the water under the heaven should be gathered together into one meeting place in order that he may stand upon a firm foundation or does he pray let the earth bring forth in order that he may partake of the things that are brought forth from the earth what need has he similar to the need for light on the part of creatures in the water and winged creatures or creatures on dry land that he should also pray concerning these but if according to this author it would be absurd to pray con cerning these the language used being in the imperative may ps 34 3 to ps 30 1 7i ps 30 title 72 ps 31 18 73 ps 109 11 12 74 gen 1 3 w gen i i i 7gen.i:g 77 gen 1 20 7 gen 1 124 on prayer 289 not a like thing be said about the saying let there be light 79 since it is not in the optative but in the imperative i have thought it necessary since the prayer is expressed in the im perative to call to mind his various interpretations for the sake of those who have been deceived into accepting his impious teaching once upon a time we ourselves came in contact with these persons thy kingdom gome chapter xxv xxv i thy kingdom come 8 if the kingdom of god 5 according to the word of our lord and saviour cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or lo there 33 but the kingdom of god is within us 81 for the word is very nigh in 33 our mouth and in 3 our heart 3382 it is evi dent that he who prays that the kingdom of god should come prays with good reason that the kingdom of god should spring up and bear fruit and be perfected in him for every saint who takes god as his king and obeys the spiritual laws of god dwells in himself as in a well ordered city so to speak present with him are the father and christ who reigns with the father in the soul that has been perfected in accordance with the saying which i mentioned a short time ago we will come unto him and make our abode with him 3 83 and i think that by god's kingdom is meant the blessed state of the reason and the ordered condition of wise thoughts while by christ's kingdom is meant the words that go forth for the salvation of those who hear them and the works of righteousness and the other virtues which are being accomplished for the son of god is word 84 and righteousness 85 but every sinner is under the tyranny of the prince of this world 86 since he does not hand himself over to him who gave himself for us sinners that he might deliver us out of this present evil world and deliver us out of it according to the will of our god and father 87 as is stated in the epistie to the galatians he who is under the tyranny of the prince of this world 3 88 through deliberate sin is also ruled over by sin therefore we are bidden by paul no longer to submit ourselves to sin which desires to reign over us and 79 gen 1 3 so matt 6 10 luke 11 2 8i luke 17 20 21 8 2 deut 30 14 c rom 10 8 s3 john 14 23 84 cf john 1 1 14 85 i cor i 30 86

2 but some one will say with regard to these two petitions that is to say hallowed be thy name and thy kingdom come 90 that if he who prays prays in order to be heard and is in fact at some time heard it is evident that in accordance with what has been said above the name of god will be hal lowed at some time for some one for whom also the kingdom of god will be present but if these things come about for him how shall he still fittingly pray concerning things that are pre sent already as if they were not present saying hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come the reply to this must be as follows he who prays to obtain the word of knowledge and the word of wisdom 91 will always fittingly pray for these things for he will always go on receiving more and more intuitions of wisdom and knowledge as his prayers are continually heard howbeit he will know in part as much as he is able to receive in this present life but that which is per fect doing away that which is in part shall then be made mani fest when face to face 92 the mind without sense perception comes in contact with spiritual realities similarly that which is perfect in the hallowing of the name of god for each of us and in the coming of his kingdom cannot be unless there come also that which is perfect 93 as concerning knowledge and wisdom 94 and it may be the other virtues also and we go on our journey unto perfection 95 if stretch ing forward to the things which are before we forget the things which are behind 96 as we advance unceasingly the kingdom of god that is in us 97 will reach its highest point when that which was spoken by the apostle is fulfilled that christ when all enemies have been subjected unto him shall deliver up the kingdom to god even the father that god may be all in all 98 therefore praying without ceasing 99 with a disposition of the mind that is being deified by the word let us say to our father which is in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come 1 3 moreover

between christ and beliar 2 so the kingdom of god cannot co exist with the kingdom of evil if therefore it is our will to be under the reign of god let not sin 35 in any wise reign in our mortal body 3 neither let us obey its commandments when it urges our soul to do the works of the flesh 4 and things that are alien from god rather mortifying the members which are upon the earth 5 let us bring forth the fruits of the spirit 336 so that the lord 33 may walk in 7 us as in a spiritual garden 338 reigning alone over us with his christ sitting 33 in us at the right hand of 33 that spiritual power 339 which we pray to receive and seated until 33 all his enemies 33 within us be come the footstool of 33 his feet 3310 and all rule and authority and power 33 is abolished 35 1 1 from us for it is possible that these things should come to pass for each of us and that the last enemy 33 should be abolished even death 3312 so that in our case also it may be said by christ o death where is thy sting o hades where is thy victory 3313 even now therefore let our corruptible put on 33 sanctification in holiness and all purity and incorruption and 33 let the mortal 3 14 clothe itself when death 33 has been abolished 12 with the father's im mortality 3314 so that we may be reigned over by god and even now share in the good things of regeneration 3315 and resurrection thy will be done as dst heaven so on earth chapter xxvi xxvi i thy will be done as in heaven so on earth 16 luke passes over these words in silence and after thy kingdom come 33 places give us day by day our daily bread 3317 there fore let us examine the words cited above as found in matthew alone agreeably with preceding context let us who pray being still on earth 3 and understanding that the will 33 of god is done in heaven 33 by all those who dwell 18 in heaven pray that the will 33 of god may be done 37 in all things by us 2 ii cor 6 14 15 3 rom 6 12 4 gal 5 19 5 col 3 5 6 gal 5 22 7 ii cor 6 16 8 cf gen 3 8 gf

heaven inasmuch as we bear as they do the image of the heavenly 19 and shall inherit the kingdom of heaven 20 while those who come after us on earth will pray to be made like unto us who are in heaven 2 but the words as in heaven so on earth to be found in matthew alone can be taken with all three clauses with the result that we are commanded thus to say in the prayer hal lowed be thy name as in heaven so on earth thy kingdom come as in heaven so on earth thy will be done as in heaven so on earth for the name of god has been hallowed by those in heaven and the kingdom of god has come for them and the will of god has been done in them all these things are lacking to us who are on earth yet they can become ours as we make ourselves worthy to gain the hearing of god concerning them all 3 but with reference to thy will be done as in heaven so on earth some one may ask as follows how has the will of god been done in heaven where there are the spiritual hosts of wickedness 21 whence it comes to pass that the sword of god shall be filled with blood even in heaven 22 if we pray that the will of god be done on earth as it is done in heaven perhaps we may without knowing it pray that these opposing forces may remain on earth to which they came from heaven for there are many evil things on earth be cause of the victorious spiritual hosts of wickedness 21 which are in the heavenly places anyone however will easily re solve the question by allegorizing heaven and saying that it is christ and that the church is earth for who is so worthy to be the throne of god as christ and what is the footstool of his feet 23 equally with the church and that every member of the church ought to pray that he may so achieve 24 the father's will as christ achieved 24 it who came to do the will 25 of his father and accomplished 25 it in its entirety for it is possible by being joined unto him to become one spirit 26 with him in this way achieving 24 the will in order that as it has been accomplished in heaven so it may also i cor 15 49 20 gf matt 25 34 21 eph 6 12 22 isa 34 5 23 matt 5 34 35 24 see note 25 john 4 34 25 gf john 174 26 i cor 6 17 on prayer 293 be accomplished on earth for according to paul he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit 26 and i think that this interpretation will not be lightly dismissed by anyone who pays careful attention to it 4 but an objector to it will quote the saying of the lord after the resurrection to the eleven disciples to be found at the close of this gospel all authority hath been given to me as in heaven so also on earth 27 for having authority over the things in heaven he says that there has been added authority on earth the things in heaven having been formerly en lightened by the word but at the end of the world 28 the things on earth also will imitate the perfect state of the things in heaven over which the saviour received authority therefore as it were by means of prayer he wishes to take as his fellow workers before the father those who are being made disciples by him in order that he may bring the things on earth in like manner as the things in heaven which have been subjected to truth and the word when they are emended by the authority which he received as in heaven so also on earth to the blessed end that awaits whatsoever has been placed under his authority but he who maintains that the saviour is heaven and the church earth alleging that the firstborn of all creation 29 on whom the father rests as on a throne is heaven would find that the man whom he put on when he had fitted him for that power by having humbled himself and becoming obedient unto death 30 said after the resurrection all authority hath been given unto me as in heaven so also on earth 31 the man as saviour having re ceived authority over the things in heaven as things that appertain to the only begotten 32 in order that he may share them with him being mingled with his deity and united with him 5 it still remains to resolve the second difficulty put forward namely how the will of god is in heaven when there are the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places 33 wrestling against those on earth the question may be re solved in this way it is not because of place but of choice that he who is still on earth has his citizenship in heaven 34 lays up treasure in heaven 35 has his heart in heaven bears the image of the heavenly 36 and is no longer of the 27 matt 28 16 18 28 matt 28 20 col 1 15 3 phil 2 8 3i matt 28 18 32 john 1 14 etc 33 eph 6 12 34 phil 3 20 35 matt 6 20 cf luke 12 33 3 i i

heavenly places 39a having their citizenship 3513 on earth and by the evil designs wherewith they wrestle against men laying up treasure on earth 40 bearing the image of the earthy 40a such as he who was first formed by the lord having been made for the angels to play with 41 are not heavenly nor do they dwell in heaven because of their evil disposition when therefore it is said thy will be done as in heaven so on earth 42 it is not to be reckoned that they are in heaven since they have fallen in mind with him who fell from heaven after the man ner of hghtning 43 6 and perhaps when our saviour says that we ought to pray that the will of the father be done as in heaven so in like manner on earth he is not in any way bidding prayers to be made for those who are in a place on earth in order that they are to be made like unto those who are in a heavenly place but his command to pray arises from his desire that all the things on earth that is to say inferior things suited to those of the earth should be made like unto better things that have their citizenship in heaven 44 that is to all things that have become heaven for he who sins wheresoever he may be is earth 45 and unless he repent will be returning somehow to his kindred earth 46 but he that doeth the will of god 47 and does not disobey the saving spiritual laws is heaven if therefore we are still earth because of sin let us pray that the will of god may extend to us also for our correction in like manner as it reached those before us who became heaven or were heaven and if we are reckoned by god not as earth but as already heaven let us make our request that the will of god may be fulfilled on earth i mean persons of bad char acter in like manner as it is in heaven for the heaven making if i may use the expression of earth so that there may no longer be any earth but all things may become heaven for if according to this interpretation the will of god is so done on earth as in heaven the earth will not remain earth to take a clearer example if the will of god were to be 37 john 3 31 38 john 15 19 39 gf heb 11 16 39 eph 6 2 39b phn 3 20 40 matt 6 19 4 i cor 15 49 4i job 40 19 lxx 42 matt 6 10 43

heaven for the flesh which does not profit 4 and blood which is akin to it cannot inherit the kingdom of god 49 but they would be said to inherit it were they to change from flesh and earth and dust 50 and blood to the heavenly substance give us this day our daily bread chapter xxvii xxvii i give us this day our daily bread 51 or as luke has it give us day by day our daily bread 52 since some sup pose that we are told to pray concerning material 53 bread it is right to refute here their false opinion and to establish the truth concerning the daily bread we must therefore say this to them how can he who tells us that we ought to ask for heavenly things and great things 54 forget as it were in their case his own teaching and command them to address to the father an intercession concerning an earthly and small thing seeing that the bread that is distributed for our flesh is not heavenly neither is it a great request to pray con cerning it 2 but we following him as teacher will quote at some length the teaching he gives us concerning bread he says in the gospel according to john to them who had come to caper naum to seek him 55 verily verily i say unto you ye seek me not because ye saw signs but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled 56 for he who eats of the loaves that were blessed by jesus and is filled with them seeks rather to comprehend more perfectly 57 the son of god and hastens unto him therefore well does he command them saying work not for the meat which perisheth but for the meat which abideth unto eternal life which the son of man shall give unto you 58 whereupon when those who heard him inquired say ing what must we do that we may work the works of god jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god 48 john 6 63 49 i cor 15 50 gf gen 2 7

healed them 3 60 as it is written in psalms that is to say those who had been sick they who believe on that word work the works of god which are meat abiding unto eternal life 61 and my father says he giveth you the true bread out of heaven for the bread of god is that which cometh down out of heaven and giveth life unto the world 62 now true bread is that which nourishes the true man who has been made in the image of god 63 and he who is nour ished with it also becomes after the likeness 64 of the creator but what is more nourishing to the soul than the word and what is more precious to the mind of him who makes room for it than the w t isdom of god and what is more appropriate to the rational soul than truth 3 but if anyone offer an objection to this and say that he would not have taught us to ask for the daily bread as if for some other bread let such a one observe 65 that in the gospel according to john also he speaks in one place of it as some other than he and in another place that he himself is the bread of some other as follows moses gave you the bread out of heaven not the true bread but my father giveth you the true bread out of heaven 66 of himself he says to those who said to him evermore give us this bread i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall not hunger and he that believ eth on me shall never thirst 67 and a little further on i am the living bread which came down out of heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever yea and the bread which i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world 68 4 since every kind of food is called bread in scripture as is evident from what is written concerning moses he did not eat bread forty days and did not drink water 69 the word which nourishes is varied and diverse for not all are able to be nourished by the solidity and vigorous force of the divine teachings therefore desiring to command a disciplined 70 diet adapted to those who are more perfect he says the bread which i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world 71 and a little further on except ye eat the flesh of the 5 john 6 28 529 60 ps 107 20 6i john 6 28 27 62 john

the flesh of christ which being the word hath become flesh as it is said the word became flesh 73 when we ate and 74 drank him he also dwelt among us but when ever he is distributed 74a then is fulfilled we beheld his glory 73 this is the bread which came down out of heaven not as the fathers did eat and died he that eateth this bread shall live for ever 75 5 paul speaking to the corinthians as to babes and walking after the manner of men says i fed you with milk not with meat for ye were not able to bear it nay not even now are ye able for ye are yet carnal 76 and in the epistle to the hebrews and ye are become such as have need of milk not of solid food for everyone that partaketh of milk is without experience of the word of righteousness for he is a babe but solid food is for full grown men even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil 77 and i think that the words one man hath faith to eat all things but he that is weak eateth herbs 78 were not said by him prin cipally concerning bodily nourishment but concerning the words of god that nourish the soul the most believing and per fect man being able to partake of all things whom he indicates in the words one man hath faith to eat all things the weaker and less perfect being content with simpler teachings which do not produce in him full vigour and this person he means to point out when he says but he that is weak eateth herbs 6 and i think that the saying of solomon in proverbs teaches us that he who cannot receive the stronger and more important points of doctrine because of his simplicity but not however holding erroneous opinions is to be preferred to him who though more skilful and quick sighted and giving greater thought to things yet fails to see clearly what concerns the peace and harmony of the whole his saying is as follows 72 john 6 53 57 73 john 1 114 74 supplied in the text by koetschau w john 6 i z 75 john 6 58 7 i cor 3 1 3 77 heb 5 12 14 78 rom 14

conscience when we were the guests of those who could not offer us more preferably to high flown words exalted against the knowledge of god 80 which with much persuasiveness pro claim a doctrine foreign to the father of our lord jesus who has given the law and the prophets 81 therefore in order that we may not be sick of soul through lack of nourishment nor die to 82 god because of a famine of the word of the lord 83 let us ask from the father the living bread 84 which is the same as the daily 85 bread obeying our saviour as teacher putting our faith in him and living more wisely 86 the word emovcrios 7 we must now consider what is the meaning of daily epiouszon and first it ought to be known that this word epiousios is not employed by any of the greeks or learned writers nor is it in common use among ordinary folk but it seems likely to have been coined by the evangelists at any rate matthew and luke are agreed about it both using it with no difference the translators of the hebrew scriptures have done the same kind of thing in other cases for example what greek ever used the words enotizou 1 or akoutieis instead of receive into the ears or shall make to hear respectively there is a word similar to epiousion in the writings of moses spoken by god and ye shall be unto me a peculiar periousios people 90 and it seems to me that each of the two words is derived from ousia the one meaning the bread that comes together into substance the other indicating the people dwelling around substance and partaking of it 8 the word substance ousid in its proper sense is com monly used of incorporeal things by those who maintain that the reality of incorporeal things is primary such things having stable existence not admitting of addition nor suffering diminu tion for this is the characteristic of bodies that they are sus ceptible of increase and wasting because they are in a state of flux and need a sustaining force to come upon them and nour ish them if at a given time they receive more than they lose 79 prov 15 17 8 ii cor 10 5 8i matt 5 17 82 rom 14 8 83 amos8 n 84j hn6 5i 85 matt 6 11 luke 11 3 86 sefr ttpw 87 cf job 33 1 31 34 16 37 14 isa i 2 8 ps 50 10 lxx see note so ex 19 6 5 on prayer 299 there is an increase but if less a decrease sometimes it may happen that because nothing at all comes upon them they are in a state of absolute decrease so to speak but those who hold that the reality of incorporeal things is secondary and that of corporeal things is primary define substance as follows sub stance is the prime matter of existents and the source of exis tents the matter of bodies and the source of bodies of things named and the source of things named or it is the first sub strate without quality or the antecedent of existents or that which receives all changes or alterations but is itself subject to no alteration according to the proper notion of the term or else that which persists through all alteration or change for such people substance is without quality or characteristic form according to the proper notion of the term and has no determined size but as a suitable place so to speak is inherent in every quality they formally define as qualities energies and actions in which it has happened that there are movements and stationary conditions they say that substance according to the proper notion of the term does not partake of any of these but that it is always inseparable from some one of them and is none the less affected by and receptive of every expression of activity according as that acts or changes for the tension that accom panies substance and permeates it in every part is the cause of every quality and of whatever adaptations of it there may be they say that substance is in every part subject to change and divisible and that any substance may be compounded with any other and still form a unity 9 since in our discussion of the word substance ousia necessary because of the terms daily epiousios bread and peculiar periousios people we have shown that the different meanings of ousia are to be distinguished and since in the pre ceding discussion we saw that the bread for which we are to ask is spiritual we must needs form a conception of the ousia which is akin to that of the bread the bodily bread which is distributed for the body of him who is nourished thereby passes into his substance similarly the living bread which has come down out of heaven 91 being distributed for the mind and the soul imparts a share of its peculiar power to him who has willingly accepted the nourishment that comes from it and thus the bread which we ask for will be epiousios and again according to the quality of the food whether it be solid and adapted to athletes or of a milky or herbal kind he who is 91 john 6 51 3oo origen nourished acquires different forces so also it follows that when the word of god is given either as milk suitably for babes or as herbs suitably for them that are weak 92 or as flesh 93 seasonably for those who are contesting each of those who are nourished in proportion as he has offered himself to the word can accomplish this or that thing or becomes such or such a person there is however so called food which is harmful an other kind which produces disease and yet another which can not be given at all and all these may be transferred by analogy to the different kinds of so called teachings regarded as nourish ing therefore epiousios bread is that which is best adapted to the reasonable nature and akin to it in its very substance it pro vides at once health and vigour and strength to the soul and imparts a share of its own immortality for the word of god is immortal to him who eats of it 10 this epiousios bread seems to me to have been called in scripture by another name the tree of life to which he who puts forth his hand and takes of it shall live for ever 94 and by a third name this tree is called the wisdom of god by solomon in these words she is a tree of life to all them that lay hold upon her and is safe for them that stay themselves as upon the lord 95 and since the angels also are nourished by the wisdom of god and from the contemplation of truth and wisdom receive strength to carry out their special tasks it is said in psalms that the angels also are nourished and that the men of god who are called hebrews share this food with the angels and so to speak feast together with them such a statement is man did eat angels food 96 our mind is not so poverty stricken as to think that the angels always partake of and are nourished by some such bodily food as we are told came down from heaven upon those who had gone forth out of egypt 97 or that this was the bread which the hebrews partook of with the angels who are the ministering spirits 98 of god n as we discuss the epiousios bread and the tree of life and the wisdom of god and the food that men and angels had in common it is not out of place to pay attention also to the three men of whom genesis writes who turned in and lodged with abraham and partook of three measures of fine flour kneaded for the making of cakes baked in the ashes 99 perhaps this is to be taken quite figuratively for the saints are able to partake 92 cf heb 5 12 14 rom 14 2 93 john 6 51 94 gen 2 9 3 22 95 prov 3 18 96 p s 78 25 97 ex 16 12 16 98 heb 1 14 99 gen 18 2 6 on prayer 3oi on occasion of spiritual and reasonable food not only in com pany with men but also with diviner powers either for their own benefit or in order to display what great nourishment they are able to procure for themselves and angels are glad and are nourished by such a display and they become the more ready to co operate in every way and in the sequel to conspire for further and greater understanding on the part of him who glad dens and so to speak nourishes them with the nutriment of teachings formerly prepared 1 and it is not to be wondered at if a man feeds angels for indeed even christ acknowledges that he stands at the door and knocks so that he may come in to him who has opened it for him and sup with him 2 of the things that he has afterwards he will share what is his own with him who has first entertained according to his ability the son of god 12 he who partakes of the epiousios bread strengthens his heart 3 and becomes a son of god but he who participates in the dragon is none other than the ethiopian 4 spiritually himself changed into a serpent because of the toils of the dragon 5 so that even when he says he wishes to be baptized 6 he hears the reproach of the word against him serpents 7 offspring of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come 8 and david says this concerning the body of the dragon that was feasted upon by the ethiopians thou brakest the heads of the dragons upon the water thou didst smite the head of the dragon in pieces 9 thou g vest him to be meat to the peoples the ethiopians 10 and if it is not incongruous since the son of god subsists substantially and the adversary 11 also subsists that either of them should be the food of this or that why should we hesitate to admit in the case of all powers greater or inferior and in the case of man that every one of us can be nourished by them all for example when peter was about to have fellow ship with the centurion cornelius and those who gathered together with him in gaesarea and afterwards to impart of the words of god to the gentiles also he saw the vessel let down by four corners from heaven in which were all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping

reason teach us that some are nourishing for us while others are the opposite until god having cleansed 12 them makes them all nourishing even those of every kind today 13 this being so and there being such a variety of meats the one that surpasses all that have been named is the epiousios bread concerning which we ought to pray that we may be deemed worthy of it and by feeding on god the word who was in the beginning with god 14 may be deified but some one will say that epiousios is formed from epienai 1 5 so that we are bidden to ask for the bread appropriate to the coming age in order that god by anticipation may give us it now with the re sult that what is to be given tomorrow so to speak should be given us today today signifying the present age and to morrow the coming age but the former interpretation 16 being in my judgment the better let us consider the meaning of the today as it is found in the passage in matthew or the day by day which is written in luke it is a frequent custom in the scriptures to call the whole age today as for example in the words he is the father of the moabites unto this day 17 and he is the father of the ammonites unto this day 18 and this saying was spread abroad among the jews until this day 19 and in the psalms today if ye shall hear his voice harden not your hearts 20 and in joshua there is a very clear instance of this manner of speech depart not from the lord this day 21 and if all this age is today perhaps the past age is yesterday this usage occurs in my opinion in psalms and in paul in the 12 acts 10 1 9 11 15 24 34 45

the apostle it is written jesus christ is the same yesterday and today yea and for ever 23 and there is nothing wonderful in the fact that with god the whole age is reckoned as the space of one of our days and in my view as even less 14 and we have to consider if the words written offcasts or solemn assemblies that take place according to days or months or seasons or years 24 are to be referred to ages for if the law has a shadow of the things to come 25 it must needs be that the many sabbaths are a shadow of so many days and that the new moons come round in intervals of time being the result of the conjunction of some moon or other with a certain sun now if the first month and the tenth day until the fourteenth and the feast of unleavened bread from the fourteenth until the one and twentieth 26 contain a shadow of things to come 25 who is wise 27 and so great a friend toward god 28 as to perceive the first of many months and the tenth day of it and so forth what ought i to say of the feast of the seven weeks 29 and of the seventh month 30 of which the new moon is a day of trumpets but on the tenth a day of atonement 31 things known to god alone who has laid down laws concerning them and who has so entered into the mind of christ 32 that he can understand the seven years of the freedom of the hebrew servants and the release of debts and the relief from tillage of the holy land 33 and there is also what is called the jubile over and above the feast of seven years 34 but what it is clearly or what are the true laws to be ful filled in it no one can even so much as imagine save he who has contemplated the father's will concerning his ordinances in all the ages in accordance with his unsearchable judgments and his ways past finding out 35 15 i have often found myself at a loss when i bring together two conflicting apostolic sayings how it is the end of the ages in which once jesus hath been manifested to put away sins 22 ps 90 4 23 heb 13 8 24 gf gal 4 10

by the sacrifice of himself 36 and in the epistle to the ephesians that in the ages to come he might shew the exceed ing riches of his grace in kindness towards us 37 if i may offer a conjecture on so great a matter i think that as the last month is the end of the year after which the beginning of another month ensues so it may be that since several ages complete as it were a year of ages the present age is the end after which certain ages to come will ensue of which the age to come is the beginning and in those coming ages god will shew the riches of his grace in kindness when the greatest sinner who has spoken ill of the holy spirit 38 and is under the power of sin throughout the present age will i know not how be under treatment from beginning to end in the ensuing age that is to come 1 6 he therefore who sees these things and perceives in his mind a week of ages that he may contemplate a holy sabbath rest 39 and a month of ages that he may see the holy new moon of god and a year of ages that he may understand the feasts of the year when all the males must appear before the lord god 40 and the years proportioned to so large a number of ages that he may comprehend the holy seventh year and the seven weeks of ages that he may sing the praises of him who has laid down laws so great such a one will go on to ask how can he regard lightly the smallest portion of an hour of a day of so great an age and shall he not rather do everything in order that after his preparation here he may be found worthy to attain to the epiousios bread in the day that is called today and re ceive it also day by day it now being clear from the foregoing what the day by day is he who prays today to god who is from infinite to infinite not only concerning today but also in some sort concerning day by day 9 will be able to re ceive from him who can bestow exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think 41 even if i speak in hyperbole what is beyond things which eye saw not and beyond things which ear heard not and beyond things which entered not into the heart of man 42 17 it has seemed to me very necessary to discuss these ques 3fi heb 9 26 37 eph 2 7 38 cf matt 12 31 39

father nevertheless if we examine the our in the latter work 43 first when it is said not give us this day our daily bread 44 but give us day by day our daily bread 45 the question must be examined how this bread is ours certainly the apostle teaches that whether life or death or things present or things to come all 46 are the saints con cerning which it is not necessary to speak at present forgive us our debts chapter xxviii xxviii i and forgive us our debts as we also have for given our debtors 47 or as luke and forgive us our sins for we ourselves also have forgiven 48 every one that is indebted to us 49 concerning debts the apostle also says render to all their debts tribute to whom tribute is due fear to whom fear custom to whom custom honour to whom honour owe no man anything save to love one another 50 we owe therefore having certain duties not only in the matter of giving but also in gentle speech and in certain particular actions and we also owe it to others to have a certain kind of disposition towards them owing these things we either repay them by fulfilling what is commanded by the divine law or by despising the wholesome word and failing to repay we remain in debt 2 a similar thing must be observed in our debts to the brethren that is to say to those who have been born again with us in christ according to the word of godliness and share with us fathers and mothers there is also a debt to citizens and another common debt to all men particularly strangers and also those who have attained the age of fathers 51 and still an other to certain whom it is reasonable to honour as sons or as brethren he therefore who omits to pay debts to the brethren remains a debtor in respect of what he has not done and so if even we fail in anything that is due from us to men as concerning the spirit of kindly wisdom our debt becomes greater moreover we are debtors in what we owe to our selves in so using the body that we do not waste its strength 43 i.e luke 44 matt 6 1 1 45 luke 1 1 3 46 i cor 3 22 47 matt 6 12 48 so the text here but see xviii 2 45 luke 1 1 14 50 rom 13 7 8 51 reading text as emended by klostermanru a.c 20 306 origen through love of pleasure and we are debtors to observe this care also for the soul and to show forethought for the acuteness of the mind and for the word that it may be without sting and helpful and in no way idle 52 in fact whenever we fail to pay what is owing to us by ourselves our debt becomes heavier 3 and above all since we are the workmanship 53 and thing formed 54 of god that surpasses all else we owe it to maintain a certain disposition towards him and that love which is with all the heart and with all the strength and with all the mind 55 which things if we do not rightly perform we remain debtors to god sinning towards the lord and who in that case will pray for us for if a man sinning sin against a man they will even pray for him but if he sin against the lord who will pray for him 56 as eli says in the first book of the king doms moreover since christ bought us with his own blood 57 we are debtors even as every servant is the debtor of him who bought him for so much a sum of money as was given for him we also incur a debt to the holy spirit which is paid when we do not grieve him in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption 58 and if we do not grieve him we bear the fruits which are demanded of us since he is present with us and quickeneth 59 our soul and even though we do not know precisely who is the angel of each of us who be holds the face of the father in heaven 60 at any rate it is mani fest to each one of us when he reflects upon it that we are debtors to him also for certain things and moreover if we are in a theatre of the world and angels and men 61 we ought to know that as he who is in a theatre is a debtor to say or do such and such things in the sight of the spectators which if he fails to do he is punished for having insulted the whole house so also we owe to the whole world and to all the angels and to the race of men those things which if we are willing we shall learn from wisdom 4 but apart from these more general considerations there is a certain debt due from a widow for whom the church pro vides and another due from a deacon and another from a presbyter but the debt due from a bishop is the heaviest since it is demanded of him by the saviour of the whole church 52 matt 12 36 53 eph 2 10 54 rom 9 20 55 cf mark 12 30 56 i sam 2 25 57 cf acts 20 28 rev 5 9 i peter i i8 9 19 58 eph 4 30 59 john 6 63 cf ii cor 3 6 j matt 18 10 si i cor

wife unto the husband 62 and he goes on to say defraud ye not one another 63 and what need is there for me to speak when the readers of this book can make up their own reckonings from what has been said previously which debts if we fail to pay we shall be kept in prison or if we pay shall be set free howbeit in life there is not an hour of the night or the day that we do not owe something 5 now in owing a debt either a man pays or else refuses payment and he can pay during his lifetime and he can also refuse payment and some indeed owe no man anything 64 while others pay the greater part and owe a little and others again pay a little and owe the greater part and there may be a man who pays up nothing and owes everything of course he who pays all so as to owe nothing achieves this result at some time or another and he needs a period of grace 65 concerning his former debts which grace can reasonably be obtained by a man who has made it his aim to be in the position at a certain date of not owing anything which has not been paid when the debt falls due but actual transgressions being engraved upon our reason become of themselves 66 the written bond against us 67 by which we shall be judged like books testified under the hand of all so to speak which shall be brought forward when we shall all stand before the judgment seat 68 of christ that each one may receive the things done in the body accord ing to what he hath done whether it be good or bad 69 as concerning these debts it is also said in proverbs do not give thyself for security thou who respectest thy person for if thou hast not whence to pay they will take thy bed from under thy ribs o 6 now if we are in debt to so many assuredly some are also in debt to us some are in debt to us as to men others as to citizens others again as to fathers and some as to sons and yet again as wives to husbands or as friends to friends when ever therefore out of our numerous debtors some show re missness about paying back what is due to us we shall act with fellow feeling and not bear malice towards them remembering 62 i cor 7 3 63 i cor 7 5 64 rom 13 8 65 see note 66 reading avrai for asrcu 67 col 2 14 68 rom 14 10 69 n

refused payment as the time went on during which we ought to have done this or that to our neighbour we shall be gentler towards those who have incurred a debt to us and have not paid what is due and especially will this be so if we do not forget our transgressions against god and the iniquity we have spoken on high 71 either in ignorance of the truth or in discontent at the misfor tunes which have fallen to our lot 7 if we are unwilling to be gentler towards those who have incurred a debt with us we shall suffer what he did who would not concede the hundred pence to his fellow servant 5 72 this man who had himself previously received a concession according to the parable in the gospel 73 his master re proached 74 and exacted from him what had been previously conceded saying to him c c thou wicked and slothful servant 75 shouldest not thou have had mercy on thy fellow servant even as i had mercy on thee 76 cast ye him into prison till he pay all that is due 5 and then the lord went on to say so shall also my heavenly father do unto you if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts 5 77 certainly those who say that they repent of the sins they have committed against us must be forgiven even though the debtor does this frequently for if 55 he says thy brother sin against thee seven times in a day and seven times turn saying i repent thou shalt forgive him 5578 it is not we who are harsh towards those who do not repent rather such persons are wicked to their own hurt for he that refuseth correction hateth himself 79 and even in the case of such persons every means must be sought to care for him who is so completely perverted that he does not even perceive his own wicked deeds but is drunk with a drunkenness more deadly than that of wine that which comes from the darkening power of wickedness 8 when luke says forgive us our sins 80 since the sins arise from our being in debt and not paying he says the same thing as matthew but luke seems not to give room

known by the fruits 81 as one who has received the holy spirit and has be come spiritual 82 by being led by the spirit as a son of god 83 to do everything in accordance with reason such a one forgives whatever god forgives and retains 84 such sins as are incurable and even as the prophets serve god in speaking not the things of their own but of the divine will so also he serves him who alone hath power to forgive 85 even god 9 in the gospel according to john the following is said con cerning the forgiveness of sins by the apostles receive ye the holy ghost whose soever sins ye forgive they are forgiven unto them whose soever sins ye retain they are retained 84 if one were to take these words without due consideration one might lay a charge against the apostles for not forgiving all in order that sins might be forgiven to all but retaining the sins of some so that they are retained on their account and with god but it is useful to take an illustration from the law so as to understand the forgiveness of sins that comes from god to men through men the priests according to the law are pro hibited in the case of certain sins from offering a sacrifice that the faults may be forgiven those for whom the sacrifices are made and though the priest has power to offer as concerning certain involuntary or voluntary faults 86 he actually does not offer burnt offering and sin offering 87 for adultery or volun tary murder or any other more grievous transgression in like manner therefore the apostles also and those likened to the apostles being priests of the great high priest 88 having re ceived knowledge of the healing that comes from god know being taught by the holy spirit concerning what sins they ought to offer sacrifices and when and in what manner and they understand concerning what sins they ought not to do this eh the priest for example learning that his sons hophni and phinehas were sinning since he was unable to help them to secure forgiveness of their sins acknowledged

office perhaps because they have no accurate grasp of the knowledge that a priest should possess boast that they are able to pardon even idolatry and to forgive adultery and fornication on the ground that by means of the prayer offered for those who have committed these deeds even the sin unto death is absolved for they do not read the words there is a sin unto death not concerning this do i say that he should make request 90 and we must not pass over in silence that bravest of men job who said as he was offering sacrifice for his sons it may be that my sons have thought evil of god in their

xxix xxix i and bring us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one 92 but the words but deliver us from the evil one are not found in luke 93 it is i think a question that deserves discussion unless the saviour commands us to pray for the impossible how we can be bidden when the whole of men's life on earth is a temptation 94 to pray that we enter not into temptation for inasmuch as we are on earth com passed about with 95 the flesh 96 that warreth 97 against the spirit 96 the mind of which is enmity against god and cannot in any wise be subject to the law of god 98 we are in temptation 2 that the whole of human life upon earth is a tempta tion we learn from job as follows is not the life of men upon earth a temptation 94 and from the seventeenth psalm the same thing is indicated in the words in thee i shall be delivered from temptation 99 and paul also writing to the corinthians says that god grants not that they should not be 89 i sam 2 25 90 i john 5 16

then does the saviour bid us pray not to enter into temptation when in some sense god tempts all for remem ber says judith not only to the elders of that day but also to all those who read her book

brother for the lord who scourgeth them who come near unto him to admonish them doth not take vengeance on us as he tried them in the fire to search out their hearts 8 and david also shows in a general way concerning all righteous persons when he says many are the tribulations of the righteous 9 and the apostle in the acts through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of god 10 4 and if we do not understand a point which escapes many people in connection with praying not to enter into tempta tion now is the time to say that the apostles frequently failed to be heard when they prayed for they suffered countless trials in their life time in labours more abundantly in stripes more abundantly in prisons above measure 11 in deaths oft and paul on his own account of the jews

being reviled we bless being persecuted we endure being defamed we intreat 14 now if the apostles in praying have failed to be heard 3 what hope is there for anyone inferior to them of gaining the ear of god to his prayer 5 the words in the twenty fifth psalm examine me o lord and prove 15 me try as by fire my reins and my heart 16 might reasonably be supposed by some one who did not grasp accurately the meaning of the saviour's command to be opposed to what our lord taught concerning prayer but when did any one think that he was outside the range of temptations such as man can bear 17 in the knowledge that the sum total of them had been completed what season is there during which any one light heartedly thinks that he has not to struggle to avoid future sin is anyone needy let him take care lest he steal and use profanely the name of the lord 18 is he on the other hand rich let him not presume for when he is full he may become a liar and being lifted up say who seeth me 19 and certainly paul rich in all utterance and all know ledge 20 was not delivered from the danger of sinning through being on that account exalted overmuch but he needed a thorn of satan buffeting him that he should not be exalted overmuch 21 and should anyone be conscious of his own superiority and eagerly expect freedom from ills 22 let him read what is stated in the second book of chronicles concerning hezekiah who is said to have fallen from the pride of his heart 2 6 but if since we have not said more about the poor man anyone should presume that there is no temptation attached to poverty let him know that the plotter plots to cast down the poor and the needy 24 and especially since as solomon says 12 ii cor 1 1 23 25 ii cor 4 8 9 w i cor 4 1 1 13 is or tempt ps 26 2 i 7 i cor

rich man in the gospel 26 and of those who bear their penury ignobly and live in a lower and more servile fashion than is becoming for saints 27 and so have fallen from the heavenly hope 28 neither are they who are between these on either side riches and poverty entirely freed from sinning because of their moderate possessions 7 but a man healthy in body and in good condition sup poses that he is beyond all temptation because of this very health and good condition to whom else attaches the sin of destroying the temple of god 29 except it be to those who are in good condition and healthy no one will dare to say what may be said on this topic because the matter is evident to all has a sick man then escaped the incitements to destroy the temple of god 30 seeing that he has at that time full opportunity for receiving impure thoughts what need is there also to speak of the other things that trouble him unless with all watchfulness he keep the heart 31 for many when they are overcome by misfortunes and do not know how to bear sicknesses bravely have as a result of their sickness suffered damage in the soul rather than in the body and many also in fleeing ignominy have been ashamed to bear nobly the name of christ and so have fallen into eternal shame 8 a man thinks that he may safely rest free from temptation when he has been glorified among men but how can the saying they have received their reward from men 32 be anything but a hard one spoken as it was to those lifted up by the glory bestowed upon them by the multitude as for some good thing and how can they fail to be censured by the words how can ye believe which receive glory one of another and the glory that cometh from the only god ye seek not 33 and what need is there for me to recount the falls through pride of those reckoned highborn and the fawning submission due to lack of savoir faire towards their supposed superiors on the part of those who are accounted lowborn a submission which separates from god

beautiful thing to be found among men namely charity 9 the whole life therefore of man upon earth is temptation 34 as we have said before 35 accordingly let us pray to be delivered 36 from temptation not in the sense of not being tempted for that is impossible especially for those on earth 37 but in the sense of not being overcome when we are tempted in my opinion he who is overcome in being tempted enters into temptation 38 being held fast in its meshes these meshes because of those who were caught in them aforetime the saviour entered glancing through the meshes as it is said in the song of songs he replies to those who were caught by them aforetime and who entered into temptation and he says to her who is his bride rise up come my near one my fair one my dove 39 and i will add the following to show that every time is a time of temptation for men not even he who meditates on the law of god day and night 40 and exercises himself to fulfil the saying the mouth of the righteous will meditate wisdom 41 is delivered from being tempted 10 what need is there also to speak of those who though giving themselves up to the study of the divine scriptures have misinterpreted the statements of the law and the prophets and have given themselves up to godless and impious or else to stupid and ridiculous doctrines for it would seem that very many who cannot rightly be charged with neglect of these writ ings have nevertheless fallen into this kind of error and the same thing has happened to many in the case also of the apostolic and evangelical writings when in their own folly they invent a son or a father other than him whom the saints speak of as god and conceive of in accordance with the truth for he who fails to think truly concerning god or his christ has fallen away from the true god 42 and his only begotten 43 but him whom his folly has invented supposing him to be father and son he does not truly worship this happens to him because he has failed to recognize the temptation that lurks in reading the holy scriptures neither has he armed himself for a contest which was at that very time upon him nor stood firm 11 we ought therefore to pray not that

315 tempted for that cannot be but that we may not be encom passed by temptation a thing that happens to those who are held fast by it and overcome since then outside the prayer it is written not to enter into temptation 44 the meaning of which is clear enough from what has been said but in the prayer we are to pray to god the father bring us not into temptation 45 it is worth while to see how we may conceive of god leading into temptation him who did not pray or him whose prayer was not heard for inasmuch as he who is con quered enters into temptation it is incongruous to think that god leads anyone into temptation in the sense of giving him up to be conquered and the same incongruity remains however we interpret the words pray not to enter into temptation for if it is an evil to fall into temptation a thing we pray that we may not suffer it must needs be absurd to think that the good god who cannot bring forth evil fruit 46 encom passes anyone with evil 12 in this connection then it is useful to quote what is said by paul in the epistle to the romans as follows professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the incorruptible god for the likeness of an image of corrupt ible man and of birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things wherefore god gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness that their bodies should be dishonoured among themselves 47 and a little further on for this cause god gave them up unto vile passions for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned 48 and so forth and again a little further on and even as they re fused to have god in their knowledge god gave them up unto a reprobate mind to do those things which are not fitting 49 all these things however must be put to those who divide the godhead and it must be said to them since they suppose that the good father of our lord is other than the god of the law if the good god leads into temptation him whose prayer is not answered and if the father of the lord gives up in the lusts of their hearts those who had previously sinned unto unclean ness that their bodies should be dishonoured among them selves 5 and if as they say having done with judgment and punishment he gives them up unto vile passions and unto a 44 luke 22 40 matt 26 41 mark 14 38 45 matt

been in the lusts of their hearts and would not those who were not given up to them by god have fallen into vile passions and would not those who came under this condemna tion fall into a reprobate mind apart from being given up unto it by god so 13 i know well that these observations will trouble the per sons in question exceedingly in that they have imagined a god other than the creator of heaven and earth because they find many such things in the law and the prophets and have taken offence against him as not good who utters such sentiments confronted however with the difficulties arising out of the words bring us not into temptation because of which we quoted the text from the apostle let us now consider if we can find an adequate solution of these contradictions i verily be lieve that god orders every rational soul with a view to its eternal life and that it always maintains its free will and of its own motion either mounts ever higher and higher until it reaches the pinnacle of virtue or on the contrary descends through carelessness to this or that excess of wickedness when a rapid and brief cure causes some to regard lightly as easily cured the diseases into which they have fallen so that after being restored to health they fall the second time into the same condition in such cases god will with good reason disregard their increasing wickedness to a certain point and even over look it when it has developed in them to such an extent as to be incurable in order that continuance in the evil may cause them to take their fill and be glutted with the sin they desire thus they may become conscious of their harmful condition and hate w r hat they formerly welcomed and so when they are healed they can possess more securely the health that comes to their souls by being healed so it was once upon a time with the mixed multitude that was among the children of israel they fell a lusting and the children of israel also sat down and said who shall give us flesh to eat we remember the fish that we did eat in egypt for nought and the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic but now our soul is dried away we have nought save this manna to look to 51 then a little further on it is said and moses heard them weeping throughout their families every man at his door 52 and again a little further on the lord says to moses 50 rom 1 26 28 5i num 11 4 6 52 num 11 10 on prayer 317 and thou shalt say unto this people sanctify yourselves against tomorrow and ye shall eat flesh ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days nor ten days nor twenty days for a month of days ye shall eat until it come out at your nos trils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye have rejected the lord which is among you and have wept before him saying why came we forth out of egypt 53 14 let us therefore look at this account to see if it serves you with a useful parallel in resolving the difficulty that lies in the words bring us not into temptation and in the texts from the apostle the mixed multitude that was among the children of israel having fallen a lusting wept and the children of israel 54 with them and it is clear that so long as they had not the things that they desired they could not be satiated with them nor cease from their evil state but the kind and good god in giving them that which they desired did not wish so to give it as to leave in them desire therefore it says that they did not eat the flesh one day 55 for their evil state would have re mained in a soul inflamed and set on fire by the meat if they had partaken of it for only a little while indeed he did not give them that which they desired for two days alone but in his wish to satiate them with it he does not give a promise as it were but rather threatened with his intended gifts him who is able to understand saying ye shall spend not five days only eating the flesh not even twee that number nor even twice that number again but ye shall eat for so long a time eating meat for a whole month until that which ye deemed good and your blameworthy and shameful desire concerning it come out at your nostrils with a loathsome effect 56 and this i will do that ye may have desire no longer when i rid you of life and thus corning forth as men purified from desire and remem bering through what afflictions you were freed from it you may be able either to fall into it no more or else if this should at any time come to pass only after a long lapse of time when you have forgotten what you suffered because of your desire in which case if you do not take heed to yourselves and receive the word that rids you perfectly of every kind of mishap and so fall into evil and afterwards desire earthly things and again ask to receive for the second time your desires you may then having come to hate that which you did desire be able to re trace the path towards beauty and that heavenly food which you once despised when you yearned after evil things 53 num 1 1 18 20 54 num 1 1 14 55 num 1 1 18 19 56 num 1 1 2o 318 origen 15 like sufferings will befall those who having changed the glory of the incorruptible god for the likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things are given up 55 through abandoning him in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness that their bodies should be dishonoured 57 by giving it to a lifeless and senseless body they have degraded the name of him who has bestowed upon all sensible and rational creatures not only the power of sense but also that of reasonable sense and in the case of some also of perfect and virtuous sense and perception and with good reason such persons are given up by the god they have abandoned being in turn abandoned by him unto vile pas sions receiving that recompense of error which was due in the itch of the pleasure they loved 58 for that recompense of error which is their due falls to their lot when they are given up unto vile passions rather than when they are purged with the wise fire 59 or made to pay in prison every debt up to the last farthing 60 for when they are given up to vile passions not only those according to nature but also many of those that are against nature they are defiled and made gross by the flesh so that we might say they no longer possess a soul or mind but become altogether flesh but in the fire and the prison they do not receive the recompense of error 5 but rather a benefaction to cleanse them from the evils committed in their error together with salutary sufferings that follow lovers of pleasure thus they are delivered from all the filth and blood with which they had been so filthied and defiled that they could not even think about being saved from their own perdi tion for god shall wash away the filth of the sons and the daughters of sion and shall purge the blood from the midst of them by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning 61 for he goes forth as the fire of a foundry and as the lye of fullers 62 washing and cleansing them who are in need of such healing remedies because they did not will determinedly to have god in their knowledge when they are willingly given over to these remedies they will hate their reprobate mind 63 for god does not wish that good should come to anyone as of necessity but of free will perhaps there are some who from their long association with evil will come to perceive its ugliness 5 7 rom i 23 24 58 rom 1 126 27 59 j povlilt irvpi see note matt 5 25 26 isa 4 4 62 mai 3 2 1 28 on prayer 319 with difficulty and turn away from it as from something that has falsely been supposed to be beautiful 1 6 it is to be noted if it was for this reason that god hardens the heart of pharaoh 64 that he might be able to say what he said when he was not hardened the lord is righteous and i and my people are wicked 65 but he needed to be hardened still further and still further to suffer certain things in order that too rapid a cessation of the hardening should not cause him to despise the hardening as an evil and should not render him many times more worthy to be hardened if then not un justly are the nets spread for birds 66 as is said in proverbs but if on the contrary with good reason god brings into the snare according to him who said thou broughtest us into the snare 67 and if without the will of the father not even the cheapest of winged creatures the sparrow 68 falls into the snare for when it falls into the snare it does so for this reason that it did not make good use of the power given by its wings to fly aloft let us pray that we may never do anything worthy of being brought into temptation by the just judgment of god for everyone is so brought who is given up unto vile passions and everyone who inasmuch as he refused to have god in himself is given up unto a reprobate mind to do those things which are not fitting 69 17 the use of temptation is as follows what our soul has received is unknown to all save god is unknown even to our selves but it is manifested by means of temptations so that it may be no longer unknown what kind of persons we are but rather that we should also know ourselves and be aware if we will of our own faults and give thanks for the good results mani fested to us of temptations that temptations when they come come to make it plain to us of what sort we are or to make known the hidden things in our heart 70 is established by the saying of the lord in job and what is written in deuter onomy as follows dost thou think that i have answered thee save that thou mayest appear righteous 7 1 and in deuteronomy thus he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna and led thee in the wilderness wherein were biting serpent and scorpion and thirst in order that the things in thy heart might be made known 72 64 gf ex 9 12 35 10 1 20 27 11 10 65 ex 9 27 5 prov 1 17 7 p s 66 11 58 matt 10 29 69 rom 1 24 26 28 70 cf deut 8 2 71

and listened to the serpent but rather it was proved to be so beforehand the ser pent approaching her for this very reason that his own insight perceived her weakness 73 neither did wickedness first arise in cain when he slew 74 his brother for even before that god which knoweth the heart 75 had not respect unto cain and to his sacrifices 76 but his badness came to light when he killed abel again had not noah drunk of the wine which he had tilled and become drunken and had he not been uncovered neither on the one hand would the hastiness of action of ham and his impiety towards his father nor on the other the grave and respectful behaviour of his brothers to their parent have been manifested 77 and the plot of esau against jacob seemed to have as its pretext the taking away of the blessing 78 but before this his soul had the roots of being a fornicator and profane person 79 and we should not have known the splendour of joseph's self control who was pre pared against the assaults of any desire had not his mistress become enamoured of him 80 19 therefore in the times between successive temptations we ought to take a firm stand against what is impending and prepare ourselves for anything that may possibly happen so that whatever it may be we shall not be proved unready but shall be made manifest to have disciplined ourselves with the utmost care for that which is lacking through human weak ness though we do everything within our power god will supply 81 who maketh all things to work together for good to them that love him to them whom according to 82 his in fallible foreknowledge he has foreseen what they shall be in themselves deliver us from the evil one chapter xxx xxx i it seems to me that luke in the words bring us not into temptation 83 has virtually taught also deliver us from the evil one 84 probably to the disciple 85 inasmuch as 73 cf gen 3 1 5 74 gen 4 8 75 acts 15 8 76 gen 4 5 77 gen 9 20 23 78 gen 27 41 79 heb 12 15 16 o gen 39 7 ffl si phil 4 19

plainer but god delivers us from the evil one not when the enemy that wrestles against us 87 in no way attacks us by any of his methods whatsoever or by the ministers of his will but when we conquer bravely taking a firm stand against cir cumstances it is thus that we understand also the saying many are the afflictions of the righteous and he delivereth them out of them all for god delivereth 5 from afflic tions not where there are no longer afflictions 5 seeing that paul says afflicted on every side 89 as never not afflicted but when afflicted by the help of god we are not strait ened 89 to be afflicted according to a customary hebrew usage indicates a critical happening which occurs inde pendently of choice while to be straitened is a matter of choice when a man is conquered by affliction and gives in to it therefore paul well says afflicted on every side yet not straitened 89 and i think that the saying in psalms is similar to this in affliction thou didst set me at large 90 for by the co operation and presence of the word of god who encourages and saves us the gladness and cheerfulness of our mind that comes to us from god in the season of critical circumstances is termed enlargement 2 similarly is to be understood the deliverance of anyone from the evil one for god delivered job not by the devil not receiving authority to involve him with this or that tempta tion for he did receive it 91 but by the fact that in all these happenings job sinned not before the lord 91a but was shown to be righteous he who said doth job fear god for nought hast thou not fortified what is outside and what is within his house and what is outside all that he hath round about his works thou hast blessed and his cattle thou hast made abundant upon the earth but put forth thine hand and touch all that he hath verily he will curse thee to thy face 92 he who said this was put to shame as having thereby uttered a falsehood against job who after so many sufferings does not as the adversary says curse god to his face but even when given up to the tempter continues blessing god and rebukes his wife when she says speak a word to the lord and die 93 chiding her 86 sc by our lord's teaching cf eph 6 1 1 12 88 p s 34 19 89 ii cor 4 8 ps 4 1 9i job 1 12 9ia xjob 1 22 92 job 1 9 11 3 job 2 9 a.c 21 322 origen and saying thou hast spoken as one of the foolish women if we have

put forth thine hand and touch his bones and his flesh verily he will curse thee to the face 3 95 howbeit conquered by this champion of virtue he was shown to be a liar for though undergoing the most severe sufferings job remained not sinning with his lips before god 96 and having undergone two wrestlings and conquered job did not sustain a third contest of this sort for it must needs be that the threefold wrestling was reserved for the saviour such as is re corded in the three gospels 97 our saviour as man being seen to have conquered the enemy three times 3 having carefully examined these words and given them our personal scrutiny in order that we may intelligently ask god that we enter not into temptation 98 and that we be delivered from the evil one 33 and having become worthy through hearing god of being heard by him let us when tempted beseech him that we be not put to death and when attacked by the fiery darts of the evil one 33 1 that we be not set on fire by them all they are set on fire by them whose hearts according to one of the twelve prophets have become like an oven 532 but they are not set on fire who with the shield of faith quench all the fiery darts 331 that are sent against them by the evil one 99 so often as they have within themselves rivers of water springing up unto eternal life 3 which do not allow the dart of the evil one to prevail but easily bring it to nought by the flood of inspired and saving thoughts which are stamped by the contemplation of the truth upon the soul of him who trains himself to be spiritual supplement to general discussion on prayer chapters xxxi to xxxiii disposition and posture in prayer chapter xxxi 1 3 xxxi i after this it does not seem to me to be out of place in order to complete our discussion of the problem of prayer to treat in an elementary manner of the disposition and the posture which he who prays ought to have and the place where he 94 job 2 10 95 job 2 4 5 96 job 2 10 97 cf matt 4 1 11

the specially suitable time for prayer and any other similar matters the matter of disposition is to be re ferred to the soul the matter of posture to the body thus paul says as we mentioned above 4 in describing the disposition that prayer should be made without wrath and disputing in describing the posture lifting up holy hands 5 this it seems to me has been taken from the psalms as follows the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice 6 concerning the place i desire therefore that the men pray in every place 7 con cerning the direction in the wisdom of solomon that it might be known that we must rise before the sun to give thee thanks and must plead with thee before the dawning of the light 2 it seems to me therefore that he who is about to come to prayer if he withdraws and prepares himself for a little while will be more earnest and attentive in regard to his prayer as a whole he should put aside every kind of distraction 9 and dis turbance of mind and recollect as far as possible the greatness of him to whom he comes and that it is a sacrilege to approach him lightly and carelessly and with a kind of disdain and he should cast off all alien thoughts thus ought he to come to prayer as it were stretching out the soul before the hands and directing the mind to god before the eyes and before he stands raising up from the ground the reason and making it to stand towards the lord of all all malice towards anyone who appears to have wronged him he should cast aside in so far as he wishes god to bear no malice towards himself since he has injured and sinned against many a neighbour or else is conscious of deeds of various kinds that he has committed contrary to right reason neither ought he to doubt that as there are countless attitudes of the body that attitude in which the hands are stretched out and eyes lifted up is to be preferred to all others since the body brings to prayer the image as it were of the qualities suitable to the soul we mean however that these attitudes should be given preference unless an obstacle opposes for where there is an obstacle it is permissible on an occasion to pray suitably in a sitting position on account of a disease of the feet that may not be disregarded or even lying down through fever or some such sickness and also on account of circumstances if we are sailing 4 chs ii and ix 5 i tim 2 8 ps 141 2 7 i

pray without even seeming to do so 3 and as for kneeling that it is necessary when one is about to accuse oneself of his sins before god supplicating him for healing therefrom and for forgiveness thereof it ought to be known that it is a symbol of the man who is abject and sub missive paul says for this cause i bow my knees unto the father from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named 10 spiritual kneeling so named because every creature falls down before god in the name of jesus and humbles him self before him appears to me to be indicated in the words that in the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth 11 it is not by any means to be supposed that the bodies of heavenly beings are so fashioned as to possess bodily knees for it has been shown by those who have treated of these matters carefully that their bodies are spherical 12 he who does not wish to admit this will admit at any rate that each limb has its uses so that nothing they possess has been fashioned to no purpose by god unless indeed he shamelessly contradicts reason such a one will blunder in either case either he will affirm that the limbs of their body have been made by god to no purpose and not for their proper function or else he will say that even in the case of heavenly bodies the viscera and the intestinum rectum per form their special uses it would lead to a very absurd conclu sion to suppose that these organs had merely a surface like man's after the manner of a statue but no longer any depth as well so much for my examination of the subject of kneeling and my recognition that in the name of jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth 13 moreover what is written in the prophet unto me every knee shall bow 14 has the same significance the place of prayer chapter xxxi 4 7 4 and concerning the place it should be known that every place is suitable for prayer by him who prays well for in every place offer incense to me saith the lord 15 and i de sire therefore that the men pray in every place 16 but in order that he may perform the act of prayer in quiet without distrac 10 eptu 3 14 15 11 phil 2 10 12 see note 13 phil 2 10 14 isa 45 23 i 5 mai 1 11 is i tim 2 8 on prayer 325 tion each one can select in his own house if possible a place set apart of a sacred character if i may so express it and thus pray in addition to his general inquiry concerning it he will take care that in this place where he prays no crime has at any time been committed or anything done contrary to right reason it is as if he had made not only himself but also the place of his prayer such that the visitation of god will not rest upon it and as i look into this matter still further concerning the place of prayer i must mention an opinion which may seem rather severe but which perhaps a careful examination will show to be not negligible it is a question whether it is a holy and pure thing to intercede with god in the place where sexual inter course occurs i do not mean unlawful intercourse but that which is allowed by the apostolic word by way of permission not of commandment 17 for if it is not possible to give one self unto prayer as one ought unless given over to it by consent for a season 18 perhaps the same consideration should be applied if possible to the place 5 there is a place of prayer which has charm as well as usefulness the spot where believers come together in one place 19 and it may be angelic powers also stand by the gatherings of believers and the power of the lord and saviour himself and holy spirits as well those who have fallen asleep before us as i think and clearly also those who are still in this life although how it is not easy to say as concerning angels we must reckon the matter in this way if the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and will deliver them 20 and if jacob tells the truth not only about himself but also about all who are devoted to god when he says to him who understands it the angel who delivers me from all evil 21 it is probable that when numbers are come together genuinely for the praise of christ each one's angel who is round about each of them that fear god encamps 20 with thatman whom he is charged to guard and keep so that when the saints are gathered together there is a double church the one of men the other of angels and if raphael says of tobit by himself that he had offered up his prayer for a memorial and after him the prayer of sarah who later on became his daughter in law through her marriage to tobias 22 what is to be said of that occasion when numbers journey together and come to gether as a body in christ in the same mind and in the same i i cor 7 6 is i cor 7 5 u gf acts 2 1 44 20 p s 34 7 21 gen 48 16 22 tobit 12 12 3 16 17 3 6 origen judgment 23 as concerning the power of the lord being pre sent with the church paul says ye being gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus the power of the lord jesus 24 being associated not only with the ephesians 25 but also with the corinthians and if paul while still clothed with a body held that it co operated with his spirit in corinth 26 we must not give up the belief that so also the blessed ones who have departed come in the spirit more quickly than he who is in the body to the assemblies of the church therefore we must not despise the prayers that are made there since they have a singular value for him who joins genuinely in common worship 6 even as the power of jesus the spirit of paul and of such as he and the angels of the lord encamping round about 27 each of the saints joins in meeting and assembly with those who are genuinely gathered together so also one must venture to conjecture if there be someone unworthy of a holy angel who gives himself up to an angel of the devil 28 through his sins and wicked disregard of god such a one if there be a few like him will not for long escape the notice of the angels who serve the divine will and watch over 29 the church and they will bring the faults of such a one to the knowledge of the majority but if such persons are numerous and assemble together after the manner of human associations for the carrying out of worldly business they will not be watched over 30 this is indicated in isaiah when the lord says not even if ye come to appear before me 31 for he says i will turn away mine eyes from you yea when ye make many prayers i will not hear you 32 for perhaps instead of the aforesaid company of holy men and blessed angels again a double gathering comes together of wicked men and bad angels and of an assembly composed of such it might be said by holy angels and devoted men i have not sat with a vain council and with transgressors i will not enter i hate the congregation of evil doers and with the wicked i will not sit 33 7 it is for this reason i think that those who in jerusalem and all judaea have multiplied sins have become subject to their enemies because the peoples in abandoning the law have been abandoned by god and the angels who were their shield 23 i

prayer 327 and the holy men who were their saviours thus even whole assemblies were at times left to encounter trials so that even that which they seem to have was taken away from 34 them like the fig tree which had been cursed which was taken away even from the roots because it had not given fruit to jesus when he was hungry so also they were withered 35 losing any little vital power of faith that they had so much it seems to me i must say in discussing the place of prayer and in showing the superiority of the place wiiere the saints meet when they assemble devoutly together in church the superiority of prayer towards the east chapter xxxii xxxii a few words also must now be said about the direc tion towards which he who prays should look there are four cardinal points north south west and east who would not at once agree that the east clearly shows the direction we ought to face when praying symbolically of the soul looking to the rising 36 of the true light 37 but if someone should prefer to offer his intercessions towards the opening of his house in whatever direction the doors of the dwelling face on the plea that the heaven ward aspect is more compelling than looking towards the wall should it happen that the openings of the building are not towards the east we may reply to him that it is by convention that the doors of men's dwelling places face in this or that direction but that by nature the east has been given a preference over the other points of the compass and nature ought to be placed before convention further suppose that a man wishes to pray on a plain why on that reasoning should he pray towards the east rather than towards the west but if reason dictates that the east is to be preferred in that case why should this not be done everywhere so much for this matter the subjects of prayer chapter xxxiii xxxiii i before bringing this treatise to an end i think i ought to say something about the subjects of prayer it seems to me that four subjects which i have found here and there throughout the scriptures may be outlined and that every one should form his prayer accordingly the subjects are these at the beginning and preamble of the prayer so far as possible god is to be glorified through christ glorified together with him 34 luke 8 18 35 mark 11 12 14 21 luke 1 78 37 john 1 9 328 origen in the holy spirit hymned together with him and next in order after this each one must offer general thanksgiving including blessings bestowed on many besides himself together with those he has personally obtained from god after thanks giving it seems to me that he ought to accuse himself bitterly before god of his own sins and then ask god first for healing that he may be delivered from the habit that causes him to sin and secondly for forgiveness of the past after confession it seems to me that in the fourth place he should add his request for great and heavenly things 8 his own and general and also for his family and his dearest and finally he should bring his prayer to a close glorifying god through christ in the holy spirit 2 these subjects of prayer as we said before we found in one place or another of the scriptures the subject concerned with giving glory to god is thus expressed in the one hundred and third psalm o lord my god how greatly art thou mag nified thou art clothed with praise and majesty who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters who maketh the clouds a place for his feet who walketh upon the wings of the winds who maketh winds his messengers his ministers a flame of fire who layeth the founda tions of the earth to remain stedfast it shall not be removed for ever and ever the deep is his covering as a vesture the waters shall stand upon the mountains at thy rebuke they shall flee at the voice of thy thunder they shall be afraid 39 and the greater part of this psalm contains a glorification of the father and each one can collect many other passages for himself and he will thus see how widely the subject of glorification is dispersed 3 as for thanksgiving this example may be cited from the second book of the kingdoms after the promises made to david through nathan 40 david was astonished at the gifts of god and is reported to have given thanks for them in these words who am i o lord my lord and what is my house that thou lovedst me thus far and i was made little in thy sight my lord and thou hast spoken concerning the house of thy servant for a long time to come but this is the law of man o lord my lord and what can david say more unto thee and now thou knowest thy servant o lord for thy servant's sake thou hast done it and according to thine heart hast thou 38 see ii 2 39 ps 104 1 7 40 ii sam 7 1 17 on prayer 339 wrought all this thy greatness to make it known unto thy ser vant that he may magnify thee o lord my lord 41 4 an example of confession from all my transgressions deliver me 5 42 and elsewhere my wounds stink and are cor rupt because of my foolishness i am pained and bowed down to the uttermost i go mourning all the day long 43 5 of requests in the twenty seventh psalm draw me not away with sinners and with workers of iniquity destroy me not 44 and like words 6 and having begun by glorifying god it is fitting to con clude and bring the prayer to an end by glorifying him hymn ing and glorifying the father of the universe through jesus christ in the holy spirit to whom be the glory for ever 45 conclusion chapter xxxiv xxxiv thus according to my ability i have wrestled with the problem of prayer and the prayer that is found in the gospels 46 and the preceding context in matthew 47 on your behalf 48 my very studious and true brethren in godliness am brose and tatiana and i do not despair that if you stretch forward to the things which are before and forget the things which are behind 49 and pray for us as we are engaged in these studies i can obtain from god the giver greater and diviner gifts for these tasks and receiving them i shall be able to treat again of these same matters with greater breadth and elevation and clarity for the present however you will read this book with indulgence 4i ii sam 7 18 22 42 p s 39 8 43 ps 38 5 6 44 ps 28 3 45 rom 16 27 46 matt 6 9 13 luke 11 2 4 47 matt 6 5 8 48 reading vplv 49 phil 3 13 on prayer notes title on prayer a title is wanting in codex t there can however be little or no doubt that on prayer is correct in the course of the work origen himself speaks of its subject as ircpl zvxfjs h i and in his apologia pro origene as translated by rufinus pamphilus writes ch viii denique in tarn multis et tarn diversis eius libris nusquam omnino invenitur ab eo liber proprie de anima conscriptus sicut habet vel de martyrio vel de oratione vel de resurrectione p.g xvii 603 cf also the title of the fragments in codex col see introduc tion p 234 containing the last part of the treatise rov csplyefous to rfjs ev s a cporeaeuttby i i a corruptible body weigheth down the soul etc thus at the outset of his treatise origen states in the words of the wisdom of solomon his philosophical position akin to that of plato phaedo xxx 8ic concerning the relation of the soul to the body this was fundamental in all origen 3 s thinking i i the things that are in the heavens who ever yet traced out the impossibility of knowing god 5 apart from revelation is yet another fundamental conviction de faye iii 31 32 origene eleve son dieu audessus de toute pensee ii le relegue dans une insondable abstraction see introduction p 189 i i god bestows through christ who says etc i have included in this case in the text the conjectural filling up of the lacuna by koetschau since a quotation from john 15 14 15 is obvious being demanded by the words that follow the sentence they who hear the gospel of whom he was formerly lord fol lows an emendation by f leo in hautsch t.c7 xxxiv 155 accepted by koetschau in his translation ii i ambrose further details concerning this man may be 330 on prayer 331 found in d.c.b i 90 91 and lawlor and oulton eusebius ii 2 13 f it is sufficient here to note that his association with origen had a profound effect upon them both origen reclaimed turn from heresy ambrose on his part encouraged origen in his literary labours and generously out of his own means which were abundant supplied him with equipment for them the epithet most laborious which origen here applies to am brose is by no means otiose his zeal and industry were so in tense that even the indefatigable origen called him playfully his task master or slave driver epyosiajkrrjs ex 3 7 5 6 14 ambrose communicated in writing to origen the questions about prayer v 6 which gave rise to this treatise see introduction p 182 ii i tatiana nothing is known about this woman am brose associated her with himself apparently in the questions about prayer some have supposed her to be ambrose's sister the name of his wife was marcella see origen ep ad africanum sub fn she was evidently a person of somewhat mature age the epithet very brave may suggest constancy in time of persecution ii 2 ask for the great things and the little things shall be added untoyou an agraphon or extra canonical saying attributed by some writers in the early church to our lord origen goes on and ask for the heavenly things and the earthly things shall be added unto you but it is not clear whether he intends both parts to be regarded as one or two separate sayings the latter part has echoes of john 3 12 combined with matt 6 33 and luke 12 31 clement of alexandria strom i 24 158 2 refers to the earlier part only of the kingly office one portion is divine that which appertains to god and his holy son by whom are supplied both the good things of the earth and besides per fect felicity as well for ask he says tor the great things and the little things shall be added unto you cf eusebius in psalm 16 2 this also the saviour taught saying ask for the great things and the little things shall be added unto you 5 on the interpretation of the great and the little things clement and origen are at one clem strom iv 6 34 6 says seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and the righteousness these are great things the small things appertaining to this life shall be added unto you origen contra celsum vii 44 declares that the christian prays for no trivial blessings for he has learnt from jesus to seek for nothing little that is an object of the senses but to seek only the great and truly divine things such 332 origen as are given by god to help to lead us on to that blessedness that is to be found with him through his son the word who is god and he develops this thought in xiv i of this treatise see p 266 some modern scholars have also reckoned this agraphon as an indubitable saying of the lord e.g resch agrapha 230 es ist ein sehr gut beglaubigtes herrenwort and ropes spruche jesu 140 dieser spruch kann gewiss als eine treue wiedergabe eines lehrspruches jesu gelten see h.d.b article agrapha in extra volume b jackson twenty jive

notes this variant but it seems to have escaped the attention of english scholars that it is not a scribal error in t is plain from the words of origen that follow the joy that satan takes in

hearkening as it were to it reading with bentley e7n cda for vtrrjkoa which usually means obeying although it can also mean hearkening ii 4 him whose deep things etc an emendation of bentley is followed ii 4 so far as he is able o s e erj cre the words taken in their literal meaning would indicate that the spirit cannot fully fathom the deep things of god if so they must be added to those expressions used by origen which indicate a doctrine of the holy spirit that falls short of the catholic faith on the other hand in de princ i 3 4 as translated by rufinus in which the reference to i cor 2 10 again occurs origen says as the son who alone knows the father reveals him to whom he will so the holy spirit who alone searches the deep things of god reveals god to whom he will the knowledge and power of revelation possessed by the holy spirit is parallel to on prayer 333 that possessed by the son and he has it in virtue of his own being it may be however that origen draws a subtle distinc tion between knowing the father the peculiar property of the son and searching the deep things of god the peculiar property of the spirit and suggests that the latter involves a less complete understanding than does the former and we can not be sure that rufinus has not doctored this passage in the interests of orthodoxy certainly injoh ii 10 1 1 ed brooke is on different lines there origen raises the question whether since it is said that all things were made through the son the holy spirit is one of them and after some hesitation in the course of which however he affirms his belief in three hypo stases he slips into an affirmative answer and comes to the conclusion that the holy spirit is one of the all things inferior vttoseeardpaiv to him through whom all things were made ii 4 not to all those who were being baptized it is a favourite thought of origen that there are two classes of believers a higher and a lower and that the former alone are capable of receiving esoteric teaching here he suggests that the same dis tinction was to be found in john's as it was afterwards in christian disciples ii 6 i pray as a man the punctuation and construction of the rest of this sentence is not self evident but i have followed koetschau as giving the clearest sense ii 6 the prayers recorded in the gospels origen held xviii 2 3 that the versions of the lord's prayer in matthew and luke represent two different prayers iii i occurs for the first time so far as my observation goes for another statement involving a similar but even greater amount of search see xxii i such investigation must under the literary conditions of the time have been very laborious but we now know that christians of origen's day had several books of the bible combined in codex or book form as for example in the chester beatty biblical papyri and this must have made the task of such an examination of the scriptures much lighter than if separate rolls had to be handled ill 2 is also employed in its customary usage i.e simply as prayer with no suggestion of vow ill 2 in addition to the sense previously mentioned i.e the sense of vow as at the beginning of this section ill 3 will go out from thee etc in this quotation two similar verses of the lxx ex 8 25 28 are combined in a manner that suggests that origen was relying on his memory 334 origen iii 4 is often used not in the accustomed manner i.e it is used in the sense of vow 55 as in gen 28 20 22 and not simply as prayer iii 4 there are with us four men which are under a vow of their own act the reading followed by the revised version in acts 21 123 is we have four men which have a vow on them the reading of their own act lit by themselves appears to be alexandrian being read by codices h and b and by the two egyptian versions as well as by origen it makes good sense showing that the men in question had taken upon them their vow independently of paul's intervention iv i to distinguish etc trench synonyms of the new testa ment 1 88 justly points out that this long discussion of origen on euche and proseuche has no great value it amounts to no more than this the customary meaning of both words is prayer iii 2 euche iv 2 proseuche but in both cases the meaning vow is sometimes found although of euche many more in stances of this sense are given than there are of proseuche indeed only one passage i sam i g i i is cited forproseucke vow and in it the verb proseuxato not the noun is used v i the plausible arguments first of those etc origen's friends placed before him two arguments against prayer see section 6 of this chapter i that god has foreseen the future and it must come to pass 2 man has no free will since god's will cannot be changed the conclusion on both suppositions is that prayer is in vain before he deals with these objections origen mentions in passing section i a third class of objectors who reject prayer altogether because they are atheists or do not believe in providence he then proceeds to deal with argument i in sections 2 5 in ch vi he begins a discussion of objec tion 2 a clearer arrangement would have been to place v 6 at the beginning of the chapter v i lacking in distinguished supporters origen means that there is no sect of philosophers which admits god and providence and at the same time rejects prayer altogether although it may doubt its efficacy v i deny the existence of god etc there is an echo of this aspect of origen's teaching in the panegyric of gregory ad dressed to origen ch xiii p.g x 1088 ajt.l vi 34 he origen deemed it right for us to study philosophy in such wise that we should read with utmost diligence all that has been written both by the philosophers and by the poets of old rejecting nothing and repudiating nothing except on prayer only the productions of the atheists who in their conceits lapse from the general intelligence of man and deny that there is either a god or a providence in contra celsum ii 13 origen says that the epicureans completely reject providence v i to persuade some that they ought not to pray perhaps this is a direct reference to clement of alexandria strom vii 41 who speaks of the followers of the heresy of prodicus as holding that one ought not to pray rrepl rou sezv eij odu the same phrase as origen uses here v i those who completely reject objects of sense and use neither baptism nor eucharist that such persons were to be found in the early church is clear from irenaeus haer i 14 3 harvey who speaks of a section of the gnostics called the marcosians who reject baptismal rites affirming that the mystery of the ineffable and invisible power ought not to be performed by visible and corruptible things nor the mystery of beings who are inconceivable and incorporeal by material objects of sense and tertullian de baptismo i states that the cainites rejected baptism the persons referred to by ignatius smyrn 6 who abstain from eucharist and prayer did not apparently ab stain altogether from this sacrament but established a sacra ment of their own apart from the church see lightfoot's note ad loc in contra celsum ii 13 origen says of the peripatetic philosophers that they maintain prayers to be of no avail and sacrifices offered as to a divinity v 2 abhorreth none of the things etc wisdom of solomon 1 1 124 this appears to be the source of the words in the collect of ash wednesday almighty and everlasting god who hatest nothing that thou hast made v 2 much further of from god i.e from the mind of god see introduction p 189 v 3 melancholy madness origen uses the corresponding verb in contra celsum ii 60 where he co ordinates it with being out of one's mind and delirious v 4 good or bad in this quotation from rom 9 11 origen reads f av ov for bad with k ab etc v.l 9 ca cov v 4 in vain do we pray concerning the reception of the spirit of might it is noteworthy that this form of the doctrine of pre destination gives rise to the same difficulties concerning the reception of grace as calvinism afterwards occasioned v 4 why does moses pray the title of ps 89 lxx in both hebrew and lxx is a prayer of moses the man of god v 5 m him in christ eph 1 4 either in christ is a 336 origen gloss which has subsequently got into the text or it is added by origen from the preceding verse of ephesians by way of explanation v 5 one of those chosen so bentley emends the text of t v 3 5 conformed to the image of the glory of his son origen apparently quotes from memory the words of the glory are not in rom 8 29 but in phil 3 21 conformed to being in both texts has given rise to the confusion v 5 many generations previously it was prophesied of him by name the passage in i kings 13 2 is without analogy in hebrew pro phecy in that 350 years before its fulfilment it gives a specific and detailed prediction of what a person named josiah would do v 5 why should judas pray etc this passage throws light upon the manner of interpreting the old testament in the time of origen psalm 109 is regarded not as indicating a set of cir cumstances which afterwards were seen to be applicable to the case of judas but as referring in the first instance to judas so much so that the actions of judas historically considered are predestined by the prophecy origen indicates in contra celsum ii n that he himself took a similar view of the psalm although he rejected the predestinarian views founded upon it cf also de orat vi 5 xxiv 5 v 6 you addressed you 55 is singular ambrose wrote the letter although tatiana was associated with it v 6 the future must come to pass what is willed by him is fixed it is not clear if ambrose and tatiana put forward these difficulties as their own or as suggested to them by others it is significant however that ambrose was formerly a gnostic eusebius vi 18 1 says he was a follower of valentinus jerome v.i 5 6 that he was a marcionite for the gnostics denied moral freedom and held predestinarian views see de faye iii 179 ft bigg 243 ff probably therefore even if the difficulties about prayer that ambrose puts forward were not held by him at the time of writing they had been difficulties for him once and it is more than likely that he still had friends in gnostic circles who would press him for an answer to these questions v 6 insensibility greek atrovap cav lit to be numb the effect it was supposed of being touched by the vap ci the electric rayfish vi i of things that are moved etc as in de princ ill i 2 origen bases the reality of free will on the faculty of motion in on prayer 337 order to demonstrate this he arranges objects into three or four classes as follows 1 a things without life held together merely by their form e.g stones cut out of the quarry wood that has lost the power of growing b bodies of living creatures and growing plants when moved not qua living creatures or plants but by an external force or when moved in virtue of the fact that they are in a state of decay and consequently of flux 2 inanimate things afaxa de princ ill i q moved by their own inherent nature or soul i.e out of themselves e lavt v y e.g a growing plant 3 animate things uptfwxa living creatures da moved from within themselves a avr v the impulse of the spider to weave a web or of a bee to produce wax are examples of this de princ in de principiis origen while maintaining the distinction between classes 2 and 3 also groups them together as objects which are moved in themselves c ev eavrols j 4 rational creatures which are moved through them selves st aurojv in this case the movement and the mover are inseparably connected in the de oratione origen does not distinguish formally be tween classes 3 and 4 perhaps because he is anxious to point out as he does that to deny free will to us would be to deny that we are even living creatures class 3 much less creatures of reason class 4 this argument from the power of self motion is clearly de rived ultimately from plato cf phaedrus 2450 et seq and laws x 8936 et seq who regards it as constituting the essen tial character of the soul on this point plato was criticized by aristotle de anima i ch iii vi i held together merely by their form cf marcus aurelius meditations vi 14 and sextus empiricus adv math viii 2 for a very similar phrase vi i moved by their own inherent nature and soul cf proclus inst 20 vi 2 that we have no free will lit that nothing is in our power we have translated the phrase to l f r w that which is in our power as free will in this section in vi 3 4 and in ch vii it is found frequently also in contra celsum i 66 ii 20 iv 3 67 bis 70 v 21 the plural to j rjjjitv occurs in contra celsum v 21 and de oral vi 3 338 origen by the phrase the stoics meant the inner court of judgment that in a man which has the power to accept or reject certain impressions and origen took it over from them in the sense of the power of judgment or choice as for example the power to resist evil passions and refrain from evil actions the possession of this power was held to be open to question in origen's day by the sceptics cf sextus empiricus outline of pyrrhonism iii 70 and if anyone should seek refuge in the notions of im pulse and purpose we must remind him of the controversy about what is in our power and how it is still unsettled since hitherto we have failed to find a criterion of truth this quota tion suggests which is indeed a fact that by this time the phrase had become through usage a recognized term so much so in deed that it signified generally the power of choice and could be used of a third person in which case the our had no sig nificance thus we have in ch vii beginning rov yxiov f tumv the free will of the sun and later on in the chapter the free will of the sun and moon and stars and in contra celsum i 66 to e lv hpwsov the free will of herod see de faye iii 182 ff 9 who translates the phrase ce qui depend de nous vi 2 let a man pay particular attention etc so in almost the same words

the method of putting his own con ception of the mind of god into words as if spoken by god him self or christ cf xiv i xv 4 xxix 14 vi 4 some inferior power will now deservedly come upon him reading qf j for ijse 17 with koetschau in his translation vi 5 power for godliness power is literally tension 5 on prayer 339 origen borrowed this term from the stoics see xxvii 8 and especially the reference of plutarch to cleanthes in note there p 367 according to them tension when imparted to the soul was the cause of virtues and vices origen points out that in paul it was an enablement towards virtue vii i even the sun has a certain free will etc this passage must be read in the context of origen's belief that the sun and moon and the host of heaven were rational beings and possessed of souls justinian ep ad mennam p.g lxxxvi 971 cf c xxii 91 criticized origen for saying that the heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars and the waters that are above the heavens are living creatures eju i fuxa and are rational powers of a sort cf de princ i 7 4 as restored from jerome see c 5 xxii 90 the sun too and moon and the other stars are living creatures animantia indeed just as we men be cause of certain sins are encompassed with bodies which are gross and fat so also the luminaries have received such and such bodies so that they shine more or less brilliantly and demons because of graver transgressions are clothed with a transitory body cf also contra celsum v n being per suaded that the sun himself and the moon and the stars pray to the god of the universe through his only begotten son we judge it improper to pray to those beings who themselves offer up prayers see also danielou origene iii i origen was not alone among the fathers in holding this opinion see bigg 242 vii i certain impressions f wramai here translated im pressions also occurs in this treatise in vi 2 viii 2 bis ix 2 xx 2 ter xxi i it is not an easy word to translate in every

impressions as they presented themselves to him and either accept or reject them see de faye iii 183 ff vii i the worse course this emendation in place of the better course seems necessary since origen is contrasting 34 origen beings on earth with heavenly beings who cannot be diverted from the right course viii i vain repetitions see note on xxi i viii i nor ought we to come to prayer in wrath five times in this treatise cf also ii 2 ix i bis xxxi i origen makes this point with a reference to i tim 2 8 perhaps the bitter experience he had recently gone through at alexandria caused him to emphasize it see introduction p 176 viii 2 god who is present three times in this section origen lays stress upon the need of remembering the presence of god when praying the fact throws light upon the mystical side of his nature though for him god is transcendent philo sophically speaking it is of the essence of his religion to realize god's nearness viii 2 spies out and anticipates every

quotes from memory there is nothing about bearing no mance in the passage of jeremiah 7 22 23 to which he refers the words let no one bear malice against his neighbour in his heart 55 are a loose reference to zech 7 10 let no one bear malice in your hearts as concerning the evil done by his brother 55 another explana tion of the confusion is that the shorthand writer may himself have been confused and have failed to reproduce origen's dicta tion accurately but there are other indications see xxviii 7 xxx 3 xxxi 7 that origen relied too much on his recol lection of scripture passages ix

church than did the apostles and he refers to contra celsum viii 34 and in joh xxxii 17 xi 3 do not they even more than the apostles work together this passage does not fully express origen's thought concerning the relationship of angels to churches not only do angels help the apostles to carry out the work of evangelization but they are the heads in the invisible order of the churches as the apostles and the bishops are in the visible sphere when the apocalypse speaks of angels of churches invisible rulers are indicated thus each church possesses at one and the same time a visible bishop and an invisible angel one might almost say if we follow scripture that there are two bishops for each church the one perceptible and visible and the other invisible 1 0777 0 and just as a man if he

what they obtained in figure 1 follow the emendation of the anonymous t has so that we may ask them sc the prayers which is obviously corrupt the prayers of the saints here mentioned are clearly the prayers of the old testament saints which origen refers to in xiii 2 they prayed for and obtained material blessings but christians can command spiritual blessings of which the former are but a symbol

obelized the obelus was one of the critical signs used from the third or second century b.c by the grammarians of alexandria and said to have been first employed by aristarchus in connection with his edition of homer the word means a spit and it was usually represented by a straight line with or without accompanying dot or dots it was on prayer 345 originally used to mark passages which the critic wished to cen sure in the hexapla origen prefixed the obelus to words or lines which were wanting in the hebrew and this is precisely the meaning of the verb obelize here see h b swete introduc tion

gss as implying origen's belief that the son and the holy spirit were created beings but he failed to prove his assertion see the note of the anonymous in the edition of w reading pp 73 74 this note incidentally indicates how clearly the anonymous perceived the untrustworthiness of rufinus's translations si qua omnino fides interpret rufino sit habenda xiv 4 an excellent illustration of the definition of prayer but on his own definition prayer for origen includes a request to god for certain things there is however no such request in hab ch 3 which is an example of the wider use of the term prayer in the old testament as an elevation of the mind to god which does not necessarily include petition xiv 5 intercession though i have retained this translation of evtevgis the greek word does not necessarily involve what the english does namely prayer in relation to others but it im plies as origen correctly observes a free confident approach to god see trench synonyms of the new testament 189 f xiv 5 intercedes exceedingly see footnote in text of ii 3 xiv 5 if we use the terms in their proper sense it is essential to bear in mind if we are to follow origen's argument how he defines prayer in section 2 of this chapter xiv 6 supplication addressed to holy men also the text of t reads simply men but some alteration is required in view 346 origen of the words if these may be addressed to holy men lower down in this section xiv 6 other men here also t reads men koetschau following klostermann inserts other the anonymous suggests all men xiv 6 supplication is addressed to the saints only the reference is obviously to living saints note the words if for example a paul or a peter can be found elns wptqeiri uavxog tf tlerpo not paul or peter the interpretation of g dix the shape of the liturgy 346 appears to be incorrect xiv 6 making us worthy to receive the authority light is thrown upon this passage by xxviii 9 the apostles received through the holy spirit the authority to forgive sins others like them a paul or a peter who are led by the spirit as sons of god have a similar authority like the prophets they are speaking not the things of their own but of the divine will see w h frere in the early history of the church and ministry ch v p 292 xiv 6 stephen acts 7 60 but in the previous verse we read of him calling upon the lord saying lord jesus receive my spirit clearly a prayer xv i but only to the god and father of all for this limitation concerning prayer in the proper sense of the term according to origen see introduction pp 187 f 231 gf contra celsum v 4 every supplication and prayer and intercession and thanksgiving is to be offered to god who is over all through the high priest who is above all the angels the living word and god but we shall supplicate the word himself and intercede with him and give thanks yes and pray also if we are able to pay attention to the correct use and the abuse of terms concerning prayer the concluding words if they are to be brought into line with de orat xv i must mean that prayer in the looser but not in the stricter sense may be addressed to christ on similar lines is contra celsum viii 13 we worship the one god and his one son and word and image with entreaties and requests according to our ability bringing our prayers to the god of the universe through his only begotten to whom first we offer them counting him worthy who is the propitiation for our sins to bring as a high priest our prayers and sacrifices and intercessions to the god who is over all a less decisive passage is contra celsum v n end and although one may not be so great as the sun nevertheless let on prayer 347 such a one pray to the word of god as able to heal him and much more to his father who sent his word to them of old time and healed them and delivered them from their afflictions on the other hand a different point of view is indicated in in rom viii 5 if therefore enoch and moses and aaron and samuel called upon the lord and he heard them doubtless they called upon christ jesus as lord and if to call upon the name of the lord and to pray to the lord are one and the same thing as god is called upon christ is to be called upon and as god is prayed to so also christ is to be prayed to and as we offer prayers to god the father first of all so also to the lord jesus christ and as we offer requests to the father so we offer requests to the son also and as we offer thanksgiving to god so also we offer thanks to the saviour p.g xiv iigsf but as this passage is found only in the latin translation of rufinus it may have been altered in the interests of orthodoxy the anonymous however in a learned and able note read ing 78 f confining himself to a consideration of those passages in which the greek is extant endeavours to make origen con sistent with himself he maintains that in the passage of the de oratione origen is speaking of christ only under the aspect of high priest and advocate see xv 4 and therefore insists that christ qua mediator is not to be prayed to but that when origen is referring to christ as word or son of god e.g in contra celsum v 4 and v n he says something different the anonymous also draws attention to the limited connotation of the word prayer as used in the de oratione here xv i teach us to pray our father etc origen here confuses matthew and luke the words teach us to pray come from luke 11 2 but our father etc from matt 6 9 indeed in xviii 2 origen gives the text of the prayer in luke as father hallowed be thy name etc xv i the son is different from the father in person and subject erepos car ovcriav kal vttok i vov 09 r zarw o vies rov 7rarpo apparently origen uses ovo ia here in the sense of per son that which distinguishes the son from the father as he also does in in joh ii 23 where he argues that because the son is called light and the father is called light it does not follow that the son is not in ovvia i.e person different from the father cf also in joh i 28 fin and contra celsum vi 64 vtrokeifaevos is similarly used in in jerem hom viii 2 c.b vi 57 a similar use of the term ovaia appears in eusebius h.e vi 33 in describing the heresy of beryllus of bostra 348 origen whom origen converted to orthodoxy on the other hand ovcria and virokelyizvos are distinguished in in jo a x 37 ovcrla meaning essence and vtrokeifjwos person or subject see bigg 203 note bethune baker 149 f prat origene 172 xv i in accordance with the words he sware the anony mous would read the lord sware following ps 109 4 lxx and heb 7 21 xv 2 it is not fitting that a man should pray to him who prays cf contra celsum v 1 1 xv 2 had given this teaching an emendation of the anony mous followed by koetschau t

49 14 xv 4 he who said might also say this emendation by delarue makes it clear that the words put into the mouth of the son which follow are merely hypothetical xv 4 why callest thou me good this quotation from mark 10 18 is a favourite one with origen when he touches on the subordination of the son to the father cf contra celsum v n in joh i 35 ii 13 xiii 36 also vi 47 xiii 25 exhort 7 see h

xvi 2 the shadow of the bodily object the illustration may be found puzzling if it is not perceived that in the case of a human giver the bodily object is the important thing the shadow which it casts is unimportant but in the case of the divine giver the heavenly spiritual gifts are what really matter the on prayer 349 earthly blessings are the shadows of the heavenly things and are quite inferior it is the will of god to give us heavenly things the bodily blessings which are added matt 6 33 are merely their natural accompaniments xvi 3 material dew see note on xiii 2 xvi 3 does it not follow etc a free translation is given of this sentence following an emendation of bentley in any case origen's meaning is clear jonah and his physical deliverance is typical of the spiritual deliverance of those who look to jesus as saviour xvi 3 the great fish i.e allegorically the devil with refer ence to job 3 8 as is apparent from in joh i 17 and de prim iv 5 cjb xxii 300 xvii i this chapter is an example of the imperfect arrange ment due no doubt to its hasty composition that is to be found here and there in the de oratione obviously it ought to follow xvi 2 immediately in that section q.v origen speaks of the shadows i.e earthly blessings which accompany as a natural consequence spiritual blessings he now qualifies this statement just as in some latitudes and at some times the gnomon of the sun dial gives no shadow or a greater or less shadow so god's spiritual gifts are sometimes accompanied by no earthly blessings or only to a more or less degree this will cause the spiritually minded man no real concern he who re joices in the sunlight will pay no attention to the presence or absence of a shadow on the dial neither should we in the pre sence of god's spiritual gifts take thought concerning material blessings whether they be given or not xvii i problems connected with sun dials cf pliny nat.hist 9 ii 72 74 76 78 where the variations according to latitude of shadows on

model or example of prayer the verb is used for tracing letters for 35o origen children to write over cf i pet 2 21 leaving us an example xviii i with what power it has been filed origen examines the text of the lord's prayer from no merely critical or intel lectual standpoint for him its inspiration in the sense of power to inspire is paramount cf john 20 31 these are written that believing ye may have life in his name see also h de lubac histoire et esprit 125 ff xviii 2 the text of matthew luke's text see intro duction pp 213 f xviii 3 it is better to take the view that the prayers are different origen forms this judgment simply from the prayers as they lay before him in the gospels and from this point of view his con clusions are reasonable and sound we should today approach the problem rather from the findings of source criticism of the gospels the jewish antecedents of the prayer and its liturgical use in the primitive church laying less stress than origen does upon its context in the gospels it is easier therefore for us to hold the view that an original nucleus transmitted from the lord has resulted in two different forms one of which has be come almost universal under the influence of liturgical tradition xviii 3 we searched also for a similar kind of search see xxii i xix i must first be settled and disposed etc cf viii 2 x 2 it is not surprising that origen as a master of the spiritual life lays stress on this but it is characteristic of him that he seeks for and cites scriptural support for his view xix 2 his accustomed oath a heightened description of the formula verily i say unto you 5 which occurs some seventy times in the gospels xix 2 they have received their reward the verb used in matt 6 2 5 is atrexoucrt which means in the light of its usage in papyri they have given their receipt and therefore cannot claim anything further in that respect xix 2 he did not sow unto the spirit the passage in gal 6 6 1 o has much in it about doing good to others and its re ward and this suggests to origen its co ordination with the passage in matt ch 6 referred to in the previous note xix 3 stands in it etc the text followed is that as emended by koetschau if any alteration is necessary except that he takes through love of pleasure with the preceding clause t has stands in it not well praying in the corners of the streets through love of pleasure frequenting not one but several on prayer 351 streets bentley conjectured stands in it praying not other wise in the corners of the streets than through love of pleasure frequenting etc the anonymous conjectured in which he stands not well who prays in the corners of the streets through love of pleasure etc at the background of these references to twists and corners and not one but several streets is the greek idea to which origen gives expression in xxi 2 that virtue is one vice is many xix 3 fallen from their deity in contra celsum iii 37 origen says that christians through the only begotten god the word partake of deity and in de orat xxiii 5 he speaks of those to whom appertains a certain divine glory and power and so to speak an effluence of his deity again in xxiv 4 we read when a man partaking of an effluence of deity exalts that very power of god of which he has partaken see also ix 2 and xxv 2 xx i a difference between the church and the synagogue the point of this strange and rambling argument is that according to the scriptures from the church the ecclesia of the lxx of deut 23 2 the type of person there mentioned and strangers were excluded because it was holy and without blemish but the synagogue could be built by a gentile luke 7 5 this indicates the inferiority of the synagogue and so to the synagogue is given that moral connotation which in the pre vious section is given to the corners of the streets historically considered the basis of this distinction is that christians took over as the name of their society the word ecclesia from the jews leaving almost entirely to their use the word synagogue xx i love has a deep concern there is clearly a distinc tion here between the meaning of t i el and aya7ra t whether or not such a distinction holds generally f i i has in this pas sage a definite suggestion of natural desire and of self pleasing a meaning that is helped out by the wider context in which xix 3 we read of love of pleasure f i rfiovia and lovers of pleasure ta sovot aywnq on the other hand describes the desire of a person whose thoughts are centred not on self or his fellow men but on god and who seeks to tread the narrow way of self discipline xx i that he may appear before the lord god i.e as a true israelite who belongs to the ecclesia which is now the christian church xx i he is a male person the christian corresponds to the male under the old covenant who was required to appear 352 origen before the lord since in prayer he appears not unto men to pray but unto god xx 2 nothing that is seen is good a textual quotation from ignatius romans 3 koetschau refers to several passages in origen contra celsum iv 93 vii 13 viii 13 36 exhort 12 in which he detects echoes of ignatius but strangely enough he fails to note this direct quotation xx 2 the actors of a drama in a theatre the illustration is doubtless suggested by the fact that the word wro cpmys which occurs in matt 6 5 in the sense of hypocrite also means actor 55 cf xxviii 3 xx 2 he shuts every door of the faculties of sense cf ix 2 xxi i do not let us use vain repetitions we have kept the authorized version and revised version rendering of matt 6 7 although it is doubtful if it is correct and still more doubt ful if it expresses the meaning that origen took out of batto logia both here and in viii i q.v he connects the word at any rate in part with the practice of asking god for bodily or outward or earthly things on the contrary in prayer we are to speak to god that is to him as we are taught in the lord's prayer who is our father which art in heaven and since he is in heaven we shall ask him for heavenly things battologia therefore includes a asking for the wrong things and b forgetfulness of the true character of him to whom we pray possibly origen would not disagree with hesychius who defined it as argologia idle speech xxi i examine for blemishes imopoakotrovvres in the lxx fi os is a flaw or blemish which vitiates a person or thing for holy purposes the use of the verb is confined to jewish e.g philo and christian writers it is suitable in this context because origen goes on to speak of the words of prayer offered up avatte tro xei ous and this verb is used in the martyrdom of polycarp in justin martyr and in the greek liturgies as well as in clement of alexandria and origen of offering up prayer to the throne of grace lightfoot on mart polyc a vi xxi 2 he who speaks muck with a reference to much speaking in matt 6 7 it is clear from this section that much speaking is ill speaking and indeed in a fragment from his commentary on john brooke ii 230 ptelocdia ed j robinson 45 origen says that he who utters anything what ever that is foreign to godliness speaks much the moral con notation which he places upon much speaking is obviously on prayer 353 connected with the conception in his mind see the note following that vice is many xxi 2 virtue is one vice is many a characteristically platonic doctrine cf rep iv 4450 while there is only one form of virtue there are infinite varieties of vice similar statements about the unity of virtue may be found in e.g prot 32gcd meno 72c any virtue we attempt to explain must according to plato be defined as the knowledge of what is good so that every virtue seems on examination to cover the whole field of the conduct of life and none can be in principle distinguished from any other a e taylor plato the man and his work 64 cf xenophon mem ill 9 5 socrates said that justice and every other virtue is wisdom 33 the pythagoreans had also held the unity of virtue but aristotle who criticized on this point platonic doctrine pol i 13 praises them at the expense of the platonists in that they sc the pythagoreans made the one good instead of the good one eth me i 4 1096 thus in constructing after the fashion of the time a double column of good and bad things respectively see lightfoot on gal 4 25 they would place the one and the good in the same column and the many and the bad opposite them in the other aristotle met i 5 g86a platonists on the contrary as origen does here would head one column the one and the other the many and place underneath good things and bad things respectively in other words origen follows the platonists in making the good an abstract unity possibly paul had this idea of the one and the many in his mind when he spoke pace the english litany of the fruit of the spirit and the works of the flesh gal 5 19 22 xxi 2 after the likeness of the serpent the reference is to the lxx of ps 57 4 5 sinners were estranged from the womb they went astray from the belly they spoke falsehood their mind is after the likeness of the serpent the words false hood and estranged which occur earlier in this section seem to have suggested to origen's too susceptible mind their use in this psalm and so led him to refer to the serpent which otherwise appears inconsequential xxii i the old testament as it is called the phrase may suggest that old testament was not yet an absolutely settled title for the first portion of the bible in the previous century however c 170 melito of sardis had spoken of the books of the old testament ap eusebius h.e iv 26 14 and by origen's time old testament must have been well on the a.c 23 354 origen way to general acceptance as a description of the writings embodying the covenant that god had made with his ancient people israel tertullian testifies for latin christianity to the title e.g in ado marc iv 22 p.l ii 414 oportebat in eo suggestu consignari novum testamentum in quo conscrip tum vetus fuerat xxii i a prayer in which someone calls god father cf in joh xix 5 though there are countless prayers to be found written in the psalms and the prophets and also in the law we did not find a single one in which god is addressed as father for another passage emphasizing the distinctive fatherhood of god under the christian dispensation see in matt xvii 36 c.b xl 702 xxii i we searched to the best of our ability cf also xviii 3 we searched the gospel of mark and iii i the word prayer occurs for the first time so far as my observation goes this searching of the scriptures must have been a laborious task under the conditions of origen 3 s time and affords eloquent testimony to the pains he took to ensure that his theology was formed on the usage of the bible xxii 2 those called sons are blameworthy sections i and 2 of this chapter if read by themselves might suggest the view that christian sonship involves complete freedom from sin for on the one hand origen contrasts it with what is implied in passages of the old testament where god rebukes his sons and on the other he quotes the words of john whosoever is be gotten of god doeth no sin other passages from his writings however modify or even oppose this inference in in matt xix 23 c 5 xl 416 ff origen contrasts the washing of regeneration by water and spirit with the eschatological re

to most impious opinions both here and elsewhere origen vehemently rejects the notion that god has a body he deals with this opinion in the first chapter of the de principiis and also in in joh xiii 21 25 contra celsum iii 75 vi 70 71 viii 49 in gen i 13 as well as in this passage it is not hard to understand how such a notion was absolutely opposed to origen's philosophy but the vigour with which he attacks it suggests what is indeed a fact that he is opposing actual persons who held it these were of two classes there were the simple minded matter of fact christians who interpreted everything in the scriptures literally and when they read in them that god was in a place or that he had hands or 356 origen arms or that he was a consuming fire they pictured him as corporeal in his nature the origenistic conception of god was one of the chief causes of conflict between the greek and the literalistic coptic monks in egypt in the fourth century see o chadwick john cassian 15 ff on the other hand there were the stoics who were in part materialists and conceived of a material force inherent in things the followers of zeno and chrysippus for example and their idea that god has a body are explicitly refuted in contra celsum viii 49 see de faye iii 27 ff see also introduction pp 193 f xxiii 3 what they suppose is a bodily garden origen similarly allegorizes the garden of eden

eusebius h.e vi 24 2 says that the first eight books were written at alexandria it follows therefore that the later books were written after the removal to caesarea 231 or 232 and the composition of the de oratione must be placed subsequently to that date xxiii 4 deuteronomy a slip on the part of origen i will dwell in them and walk in them is from ii cor 6 16 where paul seems to be referring confusedly to several old testament passages i will walk in you occurs in lev 26 12 the lord thy god will walk in thy camp in deut 23 14 origen again quotes i will dwell and walk in them but this time

xxiv 3 therefore when a man perceives i read sta rovro for ravra as suggested by the anonymous scholar xxiv 3 remembers rather than learns them this is perhaps the only passage in origen's works where he hints at the platonic doctrine of anamnesis namely that learning is noth ing but reminiscence phaedo yse cf meno 8id if origen lays little emphasis upon this doctrine clement of alexandria expressly denies it in eel proph 17 c 5 xvii 141 god made us not pre existing for if we had pre existed we should also of necessity know whence we are and how and for what purpose we have come hither xxiv 4 partaking of an effluence of deity cf ix 2 xxiii 5 xxiv 4 and xix 3 note xxiv 5 the translators i.e the septuagint xxiv 5 tatian an assyrian by birth a disciple of justin martyr who having been converted to christianity composed c 165 an oratio ad graecos in which he ridiculed polytheism 358 origen and greek philosophy his diatessaron or harmony of the four gospels dates from c 170 returning to the east after many travels he founded the school and sect of the encratites whose tenets included a rejection of the use of wine and flesh and matrimony they celebrated the eucharist in water only hence they were called aquarii the date of his death is uncertain origen contra celsum i 16 refers to the very great learning 5 that tatian displayed in his oratio ad graecos and there is an other reference though not by name to this treatise in contra celsum iv 67 but in contra celsum vi 51 the idea that let there be light is to be taken as if it were a wish and in the optative mood is associated with a pestilent heresy 53 although tatian is not mentioned as he is here in the same connection tatian is also mentioned with disapprobation for this inter pretation of gen 1 13 by clement of alexandria in the eel proph 38 1 cj9 xvii 148 xxiv 5 his godless thought god was in darkness we are not told why tatian held this idea it may be however that believing with other gnostics that the supreme god was in scrutable he interpreted the creation story in such a way as to assign the creation of light whereby god was revealed to a subordinate aeon god therefore expressed a wish let there be light 53 and until his wish was carried out by another he him self was in darkness 55 xxv i but the kingdom of god is within us the variations from the text of luke 17 21 but 55 instead of for behold 53 and us 55 instead of you 55 are not to be regarded as variant read ings it is evident that origen does not here quote exactly he changes the order of the greek in the preceding verse the significant point of the quotation for him is within you us 55 evros vfjiwv as is clear from the exposition that follows in this section origen therefore does not agree with those modern commentators who in defiance of what seems to be the plain meaning of evros interpret it with the margin of the revised version as in the midst of 53 or among 55 for origen the kingdom is first and foremost immanent and spiritual cf in our hearts all sovereign reign 55 in archbishop whately's hymn thou to whom all power is given 35 a paraphrase of the lord 3 s prayer xxv i the saying which i mentioned a

best textual authorities in ii cor 6 15 and origen so spells the name here and also in contra celsum vi 43 in joh xix 21 xrx7 vrtt jtj j y y xxxii 24 30 xxv 3 the fruits of the spirit paul speaks of the fruit sing of the spirit origen falls into the same inaccuracy as the english litany xxv 3 3 the good things of regeneration i.e the regeneration referred to in matt 19 28 xxvi i luke passes over these words in silence it is noteworthy that origen seems to be unaware of the existence of mss con taining thy will be done as in heaven so on earth in the text of luke 11 3 inasmuch as these words are found in the codex 8 of egyptian origin and the bohairic version xxvi 2 can be taken with all three clauses f h chase the lord's prayer in the early church texts and studies vol i no 3 pp 40 41 gives reasons for holding that the words as in heaven so on earth may appropriately be construed with hallowed be thy name and thy kingdom come as well as with thy will be done it is natural that the thought of god as father and in heaven should exercise a continuous influence on the petitions which immediately follow rather 360 origen than it should at once fall into the background to re appear at a later part of the prayer further many passages of scripture which speak of the coming of the kingdom are in harmony with this interpretation as for example i chron 29 11 dan 2 44 7 14 matt 3 2 16 28 luke 11 20 17 20 22 29 rev 11 15 chase however does not notice that origen had sug gested it bengel on matt 6 10 quotes from the cateckismus romanus put forth by the council of trent pas tons erunt partes monere fidelem populum verba ilia sicut in coelo et in terra ad singulas referri posse singularum trium primarum postulationum ut e sanctificetur nomen tuum sicut in coelo et in terra item adveniat regnum tuum sicut in coelo et in terra 3 similiter tiat voluntas tua sicut in coelo et in terra 55 xxvi 3 achieve the father's will as christ achieved it the verb is xcopetv which when used transitively usually means to contain to have room for and hence to be capable of and as apparently here to fulfil but the expression is somewhat strange xxvi 4 an objector urges that if you allegorize heaven as christ and earth as the church how can christ say after the resurrection all authority hath been given to me as in heaven so also in earth origen replies 3 in effect that it was christ as man who said this as man he co ordinates himself with his disciples for the work of bringing things on earth under the subjection of god and as man united with the word he has received authority over the things in heaven xxvi 4 being mingled with his deity a similar passage is in joh i 32 the man of the son of god who has been mingled with his deity xxvi 5 the second difficulty see section 3 of this chapter xxvi 5 he who was first formed by the lord having been made for the angels to play with job 40 19 lxx the reference is to the behemoth v 15 according to the hebrew the lxx has wild beasts behemoth is the intensive plural ofbehemah cattle the idea that it was the first animal formed is an inference from gen i 24 where cattle is the first living creature named it is usually identified with the hippopotamus the latter half of job 40 19 is corrupt that behemoth was made for the angels to play with according to lxx is an idea paralleled in 41 5 wilt thou play with him i.e leviathan the crocodile as with a bird cf also ps 104 26 which may be rendered there is leviathan whom thou hast formed to play with him it is clear from in joh xx 22 that origen allegorizes the on prayer 361 beast referred to in job 40 19 as the devil who is the prototype of those who are of the earth earthy xxvi 5 have fallen in mind cf milton paradise lost 1 1254 the mind is its own place and in itself can make a heav'n of hell a hell of heav'n a similar line of thought is found in in jerem horn viii 2 cj vi 57,58 xxvi 6 he who sins wheresoever he may be is earth a con vincing emendation of bentley cf he that doeth the will of god is heaven t has wheresoever there is earth xxvii 2 to comprehend more perfectly the line of thought here indicated is characteristic as those who had been fed with material food by jesus were urged by him to seek for the meat which abideth unto eternal life so we when we read of bread in the lord's prayer must not rest upon the thought of a material substance but rather understand it in a higher and spiritual sense see section 5 xxvii 3 the argument that it is unwarrantable to sup pose that the daily bread is christ because the phrase seems to speak of some other bread is countered by an appeal to the language of john 6 in that chapter sometimes e.g in v 32 the bread is spoken of as other than christ yet other passages e.g v 35 make it clear that the bread is christ xxvii 3 which i wil give for the life of the world john 6 51 note that here and in the following section origen or the ms t by including the words which i will give before for the life of the world follows the reading of the textus receptus xxvii 4 every kind of food is called bread etc a very similar passage occurs in in joh x 17 xxvii 4 ate and drank him in supplying the words ate and koetschau refers to the text quoted above except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood etc xxvii 4 whenever he is distributed a reference to john 6 1 1 having given thanks he distributed to them that were set down xxvii 5 paul speaking to the corinthians and in the epistle to the hebrews the views of origen on the authorship of hebrews are sometimes misrepresented it is true that in an excerpt from his homilies on that epistle quoted by eusebius h.e vi 25 11 14 origen gives it as his own opinion that the thoughts are the apostle's but the style and composition 362 origen belong to one who called to mind the apostle's teachings and as it were made short notes of what his master said but who wrote the epistle in truth god knows it has been hastily con cluded from this that origen rejected 53 the pauline authorship of hebrews but that is not so the words who wrote the epistle mean who penned the actual words of the epistle not only in this passage of the de oratione but frequently else where in his other writings origen explicitly ascribes hebrews to paul e.g to mention only passages in which the original greek is extant in joh i 22 ii 10 11 17 x 14 xiii 33 xx 32 xxxii 28 contra celsum iii 53 de orat xxvii 5 13 exhort 44 also in in joh i 2 18 and de princ iv 13 24 where the epistle is ascribed to the apostle and by im plication also in de orat xxvii 15 where two apostolic sayings are quoted from ephesians and hebrews in this origen followed the view generally held in the eastern church of his day dionysius of alexandria took the same view in his letter to fabius bishop of antioch feltoe p 8 xxvii 6 a doctrine foreign to the father of our lord jesus who has given the law and the prophets a thinly veiled reference to the marcionites who held that the god of the old testament was other than the father of the lord jesus christ see also xxix 10 13 xxvii 7 this word epiousios etc that epiousios is not a literary greek word is undisputed as origen says strictly speaking he does not affirm that neither is it ever used collo quially but only that it is not in common use among ordinary folk the suggestion however that the evangelists coined the word and the two examples of biblical words that he gives from the lxx would appear to indicate that apart from its use in the lord's prayer he was otherwise quite unfamiliar with it but an apparent example of the use of the word in a papyrus account book came to light when flinders petrie published in 1889 a volume entitled hawara biamu and arsinoe the text of this document is also given in f preisigke sammelbuch griechischen urkunden aus agypten i 5224 an item in these accounts is obol for cmoi o c which doubtless should be completed

coined by the evangelists at any rate etc observe that origen expresses himself cautiously but the previous note would seem to show that his suggestion is incorrect if epiousios was in use as a non literary word no ex planation is required for its appearance in the forms of the lord's prayer as used by greek speaking christians of the first century the word may have been chosen by the author of q as the translation of an aramaic original and subsequently taken over by both matthew and luke on the other hand if the lord's prayer in these gospels is derived from two inde pendent forms of oral tradition as it may well be and not based upon a common written document the use of epiousios in both would strongly suggest its use also in the common speech it may be an accident that we do not happen to have dis covered another example of it in a papyrus of a non literary character in literary documents we could not expect to find it xxvii 7 enotizou the verb e om'fccr u occurs about thirty

the purpose of rendering the hiphil of the hebrew verb azan to give ear but it is also used in the lxx as the translation of other hebrew verbs some scholars have questioned the view that the translators of the lxx coined the word but until examples which are not yet forthcoming for its use elsewhere have been produced origen's statement must be allowed to stand see h st j thackeray a

here dependent upon origen xxvii 9 either as milk or as herbs or as jlesk whereas ambrose interprets the bread of the eucharist given for the faithful daily origen's treatment is definitely non sacramental to feed on the living bread of christ is to feed on his spiritual teachings and these according to origen's favourite thought must be adapted to the several capacities of the hearers see introduction p 199 xxvii 9 there is so called food which is harmful cf in joh xiii 33 there is also a kind of food which is harmful such as we hear of in the fourth book of the kingdoms when certain

scripture in this case of rev 3 20 origen points out that in the feast here mentioned christ is both guest and host he sups with the man and the man with him indeed according to the order of the words it is the man who first entertains the son of god this thought of a mutual giving and receiving as between god and man runs through this and the preceding section and emerges clearly in the entertainment that abraham provides for the angels who lodged with him xxvii 12 he who participates in the dragon etc a refer ence as is made explicit to the lxx of ps 73 13 14 which has dragon for leviathan and the peoples of the ethiopians for the people inhabiting the wilderness the dragon is interpreted in the light of rev 12 9 where it is identified with the old serpent he that is called the devil and satan or as origen says lower down the adversary a similar interpreta tion is found in theophilus alex ep pasch as translated by jerome p.z xxii 782 c 7 lv 170 the food of all the wicked is the accursed devil himself as the prediction of the prophet proclaims c thou didst give him as food to the people of ethiopia 3 xxvii 12 the ethiopian spiritually this use of vorjros is com mon in origen cf de princ iv 25 philocalia p 31 if then the prophecies concerning judaea and concerning jerusalem and israel and judah and jacob since we do not take them in a fleshly sense suggest some such mysteries it would follow that the prophecies also concerning egypt and egyptians and babylon and babylonians and tyre and tynans and sodom and gomorrah and the rest of the nations do not tell simply of these egyptians and babylonians and tyrians and sidonians in a bodily sense for if there are israelites in the spiritual sense of the term it follows that there are also egyptians and baby lonians in the spiritual sense of the term on prayer 369 xxvii 13 may be deified the text of t reads may deify which has been corrected into the passive by another hand the thought for which see also xxv 2 note is appropriate to this discussion which is based on the assumption that the epiousios bread has a kinship in substance with him who eats it cf xxvii 2 end true bread is that which nourishes the true man who has been made in the image of god and he who is nourished with it also becomes after the likeness of the creator xxvii 9 end epiousios bread is that which is best adapted to the reasonable nature and akin to it in its very substance it provides at once health and vigour and strength to the soul and imparts a share of its own immortality for the word of god is immortal to him who eats of it xxvii 13 some one will say that epiousios is formed from epienai see note on xxvii 7 p 364 xxvii 13 this is perhaps the famous period of a thousand years a reference to rev 20 4 6 the period was famous because of the controversy that centred around it in the church even from early times among holders of millenarian views prior to or contemporary with origen were papias justin martyr irenaeus tertullian and hippolytus all of whom interpreted the passage of a literal reign of christ on earth although it is to be noted that the author of revelation does not use the words on earth naturally origen spiritualized the passage after the alexandrine manner and subsequently dionysius of alex andria ap eusebius h.e vii 25 followed on the same lines but the details of origen 3 s interpretation are not clear he re gards however the thousand years as past already and to be contrasted with today possibly in some work which is now lost he had discussed the passage more fully xxvii 13 the whole age is reckoned as the space of one of our days cf in matt xv 31 p.o xiii 1344 f c.b xl 442 see if we can speak of the whole present age as in a sense a day xxvii 14 perceive the frsf the greek is simply see which apparently here means to see the inner meaning of an exceptionally spiritual man may according to origen understand the significance of the numbers mentioned in con nection with the feast of unleavened bread but no man can understand such deeper mysteries as underlie the feast of the seven weeks and so forth the same thought is found in the passage from in matt quoted in the last note xxvii 14 save he who has contemplated the father's will i.e a.c 24 370 orig en the logos cf in joh ii 2 he would not have remained god did he not remain in the unceasing contemplation dea of the father's abyss injoh xxxii 28 for in my opinion no one except his son can grasp xa pfjcrai the full effulgence of the whole glory of god as regards the former of these quota tions origen explains elsewhere in matt xv 31 p.g xiii 134.5 c 5 xl 444 that by abyss he means profundity of thought xxvii 15 two conflicting apostolic sayings note that origen believed the author of hebrews and the author of ephesians to be the same person see on xxvii 5 a similar juxtaposition of these two sayings is to be found in in matt xv 31 p.g xiii i 34 6f c.b xl 445 xxvii 15 to put away sins all textual authorities read sin in heb 9 26 except the codex claromontanus ds which supports origen here but in the passage in in matt referred to in the last note origen has the singular this is also read in the latin of de princ ii 35 ad refellendum peccatum xxvii 15 be under treatment it is implied that this dis ciplinary process will be successful in delivering even the great est sinner from his sin cf in joh xix 14 contra celsum v 16 and in matt xv 31 xxvii 1 6 it now being clear what the day by day is the present age is today and of this it is possible to form some conception just as we can also of single days under the mosaic dispensation see note on section 14 and how they are a shadow of the good things to come it follows therefore that day by day refers to the succeeding ages when this age is over when the riches of god's grace at present uncompre hended will be manifest these wonders were symbolized in the old law by the larger measures of time the weeks and months and holy seventh year and so forth and he who can contem plate such mysteries may in some sort enter into the secrets of the day by day that is of the super abundance of the bless ings that god will bestow in those far stretching ages of grace xxvii 17 how this bread is ours i.e how the bread of the succeeding ages can be ours origen points out that things to come as well as things present belong to the saints xxviii i have forgiven wfrfkapev probably from matt 6 12 for in xviii 2 where he gives the whole prayer from luke he reads d wr iev xxviii i in gentle speech etc origen's emphasis upon the law of love in this treatise is noteworthy in view of the bitter on prayer 371 experiences he had recently passed through in the fracas with demetrius of alexandria see introduction p 176 xxviii 2 those who have been born again cf xv 4 christ speaks having received the spirit of adoption through the being born again in me xxviii 3 the whole house i.e the whole body of spectators xxviii 4 debt due from a widow cf i tim 5 3 16 xxviii 5 so as to owe nothing cf in jerem horn xiv 4 xxviii 5 period of grace this seems to be the sense re quired from the greek a eo eco which signifies rather remission xxviii 5 being engraved upon the reason cf in jerem horn xvi 10 having committed the sin i have its stamp tvttov and the stamp of the sin which has been sinned is written in my soul xxviii 5 the written bond the same expression is used of the debt incurred by sinners in in jerem hom y xv 5 xxviii 7 reproached t reads a eiatjcra which according to the unsupported statement of hesychius may mean fined or punished the anonymous prefers o treta cras threat ened neither of these gives the required sense i suggest ovetstaas 1 reproached xxviii 7 thou wicked and slothful servant a slip on the part of origen these words occur in the parable of the talents matt 25 26 not in the parable of the unmerciful servant xxviii 8 he says the same thing as matthew i.e forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors matt 6 12 xxviii 8 but luke seems not to give room the greek is who seems not to give room to refer the who to matthew as some commentators have done leads to confusion origen's point is that luke says we ourselves also forgive everyone that is indebted to us thereby seeming to exclude those who wish in accordance with other passages of scripture to forgive repentant sinners only xxviii 8 as the apostles were similarly in xiv 6 he speaks of saints who may be regarded as a paul or a peter xxviii 8 in speaking not the things of their own cf ii peter 1 21 xxviii 9 the priests according to the law are prohibited a distinction between voluntary and involuntary faults is a familiar feature of the law see leviticus ch 4 and numbers ch 15 for presumptuous sins ps 19 13 no sacrifice was 372 origen available the soul that doeth aught with a high hand whether he be homeborn or a stranger the same blasphemeth the lord and that soul shall be cut off from among the people because he hath despised the word of the lord and hath broken his commandment that soul shall be utterly cut off his iniquity shall be upon him num 15 130 31 xxviii 9 though the priest has power etc a difficult sen tence translated as in the text it simply outlines the distinction above but the negative may be taken with both clauses the priest having no power to offer actually does not offer this means that in certain cases of voluntary or trivial sins no offering is prescribed but in the graver transgressions the absence of a sacrifice is explicitly indicated regarding such trivial sins undealt with by the law two opinions obtained among the rabbis the majority holding that no sacrifice was required one rabbi levi barcinonensis however maintaining that there were three faults namely blasphemy neglect of circumcision and failure to observe the passover rightly which though incurred involuntarily could not be expiated by sacrifice see reading note pp 177 178 xxviii 10 certain persons etc at the general background of this passage lies the disciplinary action of the early church with its varying degrees of severity the more rigorous view which origen from temperament and training would obviously support found its scriptural warrant in such passages as i john 5 16 quoted here hebrews 6 4 6 10 26 30 and possibly also ii peter 2 20 22 but this epistle from its late date and weak attestation can scarcely have exerted much influence it is however referred to by hippolytus in philosophumena ix 7 of lapses on the part of christians it also finds expression in the shepherd of hennas which however allows one post baptismal fall but not a second and in irenaeus haer iv 42 4 tertul lian de baptismo 8 clearly the more rigorous view concerning post baptismal sin must have had regard to major offences only and so a distinction between deadly and venial 5 sins became soon apparent origen's own view on this matter is indicated in several passages in his writings e.g in lev horn xv 2 end in gravioribus enim criminibus semel tantum poenitentiae conceditur locus ista vero communia quae fre quenter incurrimus semper poenitentiam recipiunt etsineinter missione redimuntur c 5 xxix 489 contra celsum iii 51 they sc the christians lament as dead those who have been vanquished by licentiousness or some foul wickedness since on prayer 373 they are lost and dead to god and in in matt xiii 30 origen distinguishes between lesser and graver sins murder or poisoning or pederasty or anything of that sort the latter being such as those which the law in numbers 18 22 describes as death bearing but quite clearly a particular instance of disciplinary laxity is referred to in this passage certain per sons and this has been usually identified see introduction p 1 80 with the controversy that took place at the end of the second and the beginning of the third century and is associated in the first instance with the name of pope zephyrinus 197 217 but more particularly with his successor callistus 2 1 7 223 who apparently went much further in the matter of laxity than zephyrinus had done the rigorist champion at rome was hippolytus whose philosophumena or omnium haereseum refutatio refers disparagingly to zephyrinus and contains a scathing description of the career of callistus before he became pope and of his disciplinary action after it it has in fact been held that the controversy produced a schism in the roman church with hippolytus as anti pope of the opposite faction the diffi culty in holding this view is that jerome though he knew hippo lytus was bishop of some church adds the name of the city i have not been able to learn de viris illustribus 61 origen could not have been unaware of this controversy for jerome ibid also says that in one of his works on the praise of our lord and saviour hippolytus indicates that he is speaking in the church in the presence of origen the greek version has it that hippolytus was speaking in church after the manner of origen and in his presence origen paid his visit to rome about 212 see h j lawlor eusebius ii 201 and we cannot suppose that his contact with hippolytus consisted merely in hearing him preach in church zephyrinus was then pope but as we have noted hippolytus's criticism did not leave him un spared on the contrary he represents him as deceived by callistus and in close connection with him philosoph ix 6 7 further the controversy and the schism if it existed con tinued after the death of callistus for hippolytus says that his school continues preserving its customs and traditions not discerning with whom they ought to communicate but indis criminately offering communion to all this subsequent period would involve the episcopate of urban 223 230 and prob ably also that of his successor pontianus xxviii 10 perhaps because they have no accurate knowledge hippolytus says that zephyrinus was an ignorant and 374 origen unlearned man and unskilled in ecclesiastical definitions philo soph ix n the passage referring more particularly to theological definition concerning the godhead this opinion is supported by a remark of rufinus in his translation or para phrase of eusebius h.e vi 29 4 this chapter recounts a surprise election to the bishopric of rome a certain fabian had come from the country for the election no one thought of him as the future bishop but during the proceedings a dove lighted on his head and this omen secured his election by acclamation 55 rufinus adds from his own stock of knowledge to this account some tell this story of fabian others of zephyrinus and the coupling of the two in this connection suggests that zephyrinus like fabian had no great reputation for learning xxviii 10 boast that they are able to pardon tertullian de pudicitia i p.l ii g8of speaks of something much more definite than a boast audio etiam edictum esse propositum et quidem peremptorium pontifex scilicet maximus quod est episcopus episcoporum edicit c ego et moechia et formcationis delicta poenitentia functis demitto 5 o edictum cui adscribi non poterit bonum factum xxviii 10 idolatry adultery and fornication in the decian persecution which took place later idolatry on the part of christians consisted in offering incense at a pagan altar see j e b mayor on tertullian apol p 351 or in taking part in pagan sacrifices by tasting the victim's flesh or in pro ducing a certificate often procured by collusion that such an act had been performed see benson cyprian 80 81 cyprian ep 9 8 2 and dionysius of alexandria ap eusebius h.e vi 45 use the word in this sense and there is no reason to think that any other meaning should be attached to it here indeed since the time of trajan the approved form of profession of paganism was to take part in sacrifice the conditions on which such lapsed christians should be re admitted if at all to com munion was one of the major disciplinary problems with which the church of the middle of the third century had to wrestle but this was subsequent to zephyrinus or gallistus and there is no suggestion by hippolytus that they made concessions to such offenders the de pudicitia of tertullian whether directed against zephyrinus or callistus argues that adultery and fornication ought to exclude from communion equally with idolatry and murder chs 5 12 and therefore seems to imply that the pope's laxity consisted in this only that he was willing on prayer 375 to re admit to communion in peace the adulterer and the fornicator but tertullian's treatise is dated between 217 and 222 and in the interval between the date of its composition and that of the de oratione 233 234 wider concessions may have been made by subsequent popes note that origen uses the plural in this connection certain persons 55 involving those guilty of idolatry with regard to the concessions made by callistus concerning adultery and fornication g dix argues the apostolic tradition xviii with plausibility that all that the pope did was to recognize as marriage in the sight of the church something that could not be so recognized in the eyes of the law namely a permanent union between a woman and a slave xxix i bring us not into temptation temptation and tempt in the greek and english bibles are used in two senses of a a solicitation to evil and b a testing or trial in modern english sense a predominates and so in genesis 22 1 the revised version translates god did prove authorized ver sion tempt abraham in order to avoid misapprehension for in the sense of solicitation to evil god tempteth no man james 1 13 a similar aim in early times appears to underlie the gloss on this petition ne nos patiaris induci tertullian and cyprian in expounding it origen takes temptation in its most inclusive sense as is evident from the opening section of the chapter the whole life of man upon earth is a testing ground and he is also in his inner nature subject to the solicitations to evil that come from the flesh such being the case why are we taught to pray bring us not into tempta tion are we not praying for the impossible origen's answer is given in section 9 we pray to be delivered from tempta tion not in the sense of not being tempted but in the sense of not being overcome by temptation xxix i life upon earth is a temptation job 7 1 the hebrew has warfare hard service xxix 2 in thee i shall be delivered from temptation ps 17 30 lxx temptation ireipatripiov is the same word as in job 7 1 above the hebrew is by thee i run upon a troop i.e attack a hostile marauding army xxix 2 the soul of all flesh i.e the blood lev 17 11 the soul revised version life 3 of all flesh is the blood thereof lxx there is therefore here a metalepsis or com pound figure by which blood is used to indicate both soul which resides in it and heart the fount of both soul and 376 origen blood origen means that our wrestling is with the soul the guiding principle of the animated body called the heart because out of it come the evil passions see mark 7 21 against which the spirit of man wars xxix 2 the guiding principle to riy ovikov cf in joh ii 35 in the heart is the guiding principle the idea is borrowed from the stoics who held that the dominant part of the soul the guiding principle or reason as well as other parts had their centre in die heart zeller stoics and epicureans 214 xxix 3 bid us pray not to enter into temptation although ostensibly origen is commenting upon the petition in the lord's prayer bid us pray his mind seems to have travelled on to matt 26 41 and parallels watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation xxix 3 judith t reads judaea this quotation from judith 8 26 27 varies somewhat from the text as given by rahlfs origen for the lord who scourgeth them who come near unto him to admonish them doth not take vengeance on us rahlfs because the lord hath not taken vengeance on us but scourgeth them who draw near unto him to admonish them xxix 4 in stripes more abundantly in prisons above measure the text of origen here agrees with that of the first hand of codex h the revised version in accordance with codex b reads in prisons more abundantly in stripes above measure xxix 5 outside the range of temptations such as man can bear 7rt pacrp a v avdpo 7rwa v i read this in place of tt avdpa 7rov when did anyone think that men were outside the range of temptations which gives a poor sense xxix 5 eagerly expect freedom from ills t reads by ills which koetschau emends as above xxix 5 in the sense of not being overcome when we are tempted this is the explanation also of dionysius of alexandria feltoe 247 who appears to be dependent upon origen in this point and also in the meaning of enter into temptation xxix 9 glancing through the meshes the revised version of s of sol 2 9 has he sheweth himself glanceth margin through the lattice this description of the beloved in the song of songs easily lent itself to a mystical interpre tation the midrash applies the words to the shechinah peering through the outstretched hand of the priest when blessing the people the hebrew word for glanceth signifying to on prayer 377 sparkle origan's explanation is suggested to him by the lxx for lattice namely rw siktvojv which while found in the sense of lattice work more usually means meshes or toils of a net hence it is but a step in origen's mind to apply the phrase to the meshes of temptation into which the saviour willingly entered for our sakes an amplified though similar interpretation is found in his commentary on the song of songs book iii xxiii 199 200 203 and especially 222 the retia are there the laquei tentationum et decipulae insidiarum diaboli which man cannot overcome by himself but needs a greater and stronger than he to break them down and open up the way therefore the saviour before he was united with his bride the church was tempted by the devil that he might overcome the retia tentationum and passing through them call to his bride to rise up and come xxix 9 the mouth of the righteous will meditate zvisdom revised version bringeth forth margin buddeth with the hebrew verb elsewhere meaning to sprout to grow xxix 10 they invent a son or a father the marcionites are no doubt intended a similar passage is contra celsum viii 16 in which origen speaks of those who deny the creator and make to themselves another god under a new form having merely the name of god to whom they give themselves as being superior to the creator and with them are to be classed any one there may be who says that the son and lord is mightier than god who rules all things for further reference to mar cionites see xxix 12 13 xxix ii the meaning of which is clear enough from what has been said see section 9 above he who is overcome in being tempted enters into temptation and also below in section 11 he who is conquered enters into temptation xxix 12 divide the godhead origen again reverts to the marcionites who supposed that there were two gods the one the just god of the law the other the good god of the gospel the same phrase occurs in in jerem horn ix i there will be those who divide the godhead which is prior to the coming of the saviour as they suppose from the godhead proclaimed by jesus christ but we know one god both then and now the same division into just and good is discussed in de princ ii 5 1 cf irenaeus haer ill 40 2 marcion igitur ipse dividens deum in duo alterum quidem bonum et alterum iudicialem dicens ex utrisque interimit deum xxix 13 these observations will trouble the persons in question 378 origen exceedingly because origen's quotations here are taken from the new testament and from paul whom the marcionites held in special honour see e c blackman marcion and his influence ch 6 they could not therefore be attributed to the just god of the old testament xxix 13 an adequate solution of these contradictions in section 1 1 origen has said that it is incongruous to think that god leads anyone into temptation in the sense of giving him up trapasovra to be conquered how then can paul say section 12 in regard to certain persons that god gave them up rrapescdkev in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness that god gave them up unto vile passions 3 that god gave them up unto a reprobate mind a partial answer to this difficulty is given at the end of section 12 namely that such people even if god had not given them up would still have been in the lust of their hearts and have fallen into vile passions and into a reprobate mind but in sections 13 15 origen's real solution is disclosed which incidentally involves several of his fundamental convictions these are i god orders every rational soul with a view to its eternal life 2 the soul always maintains its free will 3 probation continues after death 4 god's punishment is always remedial not penal a quickly cured sin might lead the sinner into further carelessness so god may give up the sinner unto his vile passions so that continuance in the evil may cause him to take his fill of wickedness and be so glutted with it that when this life is over he may desire his sin no longer and retrace the path to heavenly things an illustration is chosen from the book of numbers where god sent the israelites who had lusted for flesh such a glut of food as should eventually become loathsome to them xxix 13 have taken offence against him as not good of in jerem hom i 16 had the wretched heretics understood this they would not be continually saying to us you see the god of the law that he is fierce and inhuman 3 in jerem horn xii 5 the heretics say do you see what kind of a person the creator is the god of the prophets who says i will not spare and i will not pity them in their destruction how can he be good 5 xxix 13 a rapid and brief cure origen employs the same thought to god's treatment of his people israel in contra celsum v 31 xxix 14 afterwards desire earthly things the anonymous scholar quoted by reading ad loc 196 shows that on prayer 379 here means terrena ilia quae ad victus delicias pertinet quales erant carnes quarum cupiditate flagarbat populus israeli ticus giving several examples of this usage e.g contra celsum viii 60 bis 62 xxix 14 you may then having come to hate etc some emendation seems necessary to clarify the conclusion of this very lengthy and difficult and complicated sentence accordingly i have adopted the addition of you may be able in this place suggested by the anonymous and also his alteration of they yearned into you yearned xxix 15 the wise fire this phrase occurs several times in clement of alexandria paed ill 8 44 of the sodomites god pouring forth a little of his wise fire upon their wanton ness strom vii 6 34 4 we say that the fire purifies not the flesh but sinful souls not an all devouring and vulgar fire but the wise fire as we call it the fire that c pierceth the soul 3 which passes through it ecl proph xxv 4 fire is conceived of as a beneficent and strong power destroying what is base pre serving what is good therefore this fire is called wise by the prophets isa 4 4 mai 3 2 cf also origen in ezech horn 1 3 quis est ignis sic sapiens and minucius felix xxxv 3 who speaks of the fire of hell as sapiens ignis xxix 15 in the fire and the prison they do not receive the recom pense of error the real punishment of sin according to origen is to be enslaved by sin god's punishments spoken of under the symbols of fire see previous note and prison are re medial see next note xxix 15 a benefaction so origen also describes god's disciplinary action in contra celsum iv 12 13 21 v 15 in jerem horn ii 2 3 xvi 6 as for the benefit of the sinner xxix 15 god does not wish etc cf in jerem hom xx 2 god does not rule as a tyrant but as a king and when so doing he does not compel j8er u but persuades and desires that those under him should willingly yield themselves to his direc tion so that the good of no one should come by necessity but of his free will clement of alexandria strom vii 42 4 for neither is god good involuntarily as the fire is warming but in him the imparting of good things is voluntary nor on the other hand shall he who is saved be saved involuntarily ep ad diognetum vii 3 5 especially the words compulsion ijgta is not an attribute of god irenaeus haer iv 59 vis a deo non fit and v 1 1 deum suadentem et non vim inferentem 380

spread for birds the greek for nets is s crva recalling the meshes of temptation spoken of in section 9 xxix 1 6 the sparrow falls into the snare so also in contra celsum viii 70 apparently under the influence of ps 66 11 but matt 10 29 has fall to the ground xxix 19 who maketh all things to work together for good in the usual form which this passage takes authorized version and revised version work together owepyci is intransitive and its nominative is all things but frequently though not always as here origen cites a text which has rrdvra avvpyl 6 6e6 god maketh all things to work together 53 so margin of revised version this reading is supported by a and b and some of the egyptian versions see sanday and headlam on rom 8 28 xxx i luke has virtually taught also deliver us from the evil one because as origen has maintained xxix n the prayer bring us not into temptation 3 really means may we not be encompassed or overcome by temptation it is un necessary to labour the point that origen takes rov irovr pov as masculine not neuter since the whole chapter and especially the quotations from job and eph ch 6 imply belief in a personal devil xxx i by a customary hebrew usage the root of the hebrew word translated afflictions in ps 34 19 means evil dis tress or calamity xxx i as never not afflicted the phrase translated afflicted on every side in ii cor 4 8 is literally afflicted in every thing xxx i to be straitened is a matter of choice this is questionable the word in ii cor 4 8 means not in hopeless straits not in a situation from which there is no way out here the question of choice does not seem to be involved al though paul's courage in adverse circumstances is manifest but in ii cor 6 12 ye are straitened in your own affections paul clearly attributes to the corinthians something that they might have avoided xxx i is termed enlargement a good illustration of origen's words is to be found in ps 18 18 19 they came upon me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my stay he brought on prayer 381 me forth also into a large place lxx e into enlargement 5 cf also ps 118 5 i c 9 45 xxx 2 cursf god to his face job 2 9 but the word translated curse revised version renounce is in the lxx and the hebrew bless it must be supposed that the word curse stood originally in the hebrew text and was altered subsequently from motives of reverence but in defiance of the sense of the passage to bless xxx 2 recorded in the three gospels a slip on the part of origen mark does not record three temptations l i before the dawning of the light wisdom of solomon 16 28 this is the reading of a corrector of codex j but the sense demands the usual reading towards the dawning of the light i.e the east xxxi 2 every kind of distraction this is the emendation by bentley of t which has every kind of temptation trepunra apov for mipwpov koetschau goes as far as to acknowledge that the conjecture is nicht ohne wahrscheinlichkeit xxxi 2 before the hands before the eyes before is best taken as temporal as it must certainly so be taken in before he stands etc the preferable attitude of the body in prayer is indicated lower down in this section standing with hands outstretched and eyes uplifted and inasmuch as the soul takes precedence over the body so also the soul the mind and the reason should symbolically anticipate the move ments of the body see the article orant orante with numerous illustrations of this attitude in prayer by h leclercq in d.a.c.l xxxi 2 the hands are stretched out so also tertullian apol 30 speaks of christians in prayer manibus expansis j e b mayor ad loc gives many references to this practice xxxi 3 bow my knees unto the father after these words the received text adds of our lord jesus christ which origen omits with h a b c p boh aeth jerome expressly and other authorities the corrector of 8 inserts them xxxi 3 it has been shown that their bodies are spherical many of the greek philosophers from early times held that the cosmos and celestial bodies were spherical xenophanes sixth century b.c affirmed that god and parrnenides born c 510 b.c that the whole was of this shape see hippolytus philosophy i n 14 plato timaeus 336 trans r g bury says now for that living creature which is designed to em brace within itself all living creatures the fitting shape will be 382 origen that which comprises within itself all the shapes that are wherefore he wrought it into a round cu caote w in the shape of a sphere cr atpoetse equidistant in all directions from the centre to the extremities which of all shapes is the most perfect and the most self similar since he deemed that the similar is infinitely fairer than the dissimilar the same view was taken by aristotle e.g de anima i 2 and also theophras tus c 37i c 287 b.c who attached a spherical shape to the first principle another holder of this opinion used to be cited in timaeus locrus concerning the world soul and nature printed in teubner texts after the timaeus in vol iv of plato's dialogues ii 94 but this work is now held to be spurious and to be probably dated not earlier than first century a.d j burnet early greek philosophy 280 h chadwick however has pointed out the harvard theological review vol xli no 2 that there is no specific reference in this passage of the de oratione to the resurrection or the resurrection body and

other on prayer 385 early references to the custom are clement of alexandria strom vii 7 43 tertullian adv valenl 3 apol 16 where t says that because they turned to the east in prayer christians were suspected of worshipping the sun nevertheless while the origin of the custom must be sought in times before christ christian writers were unable to resist the temptation to find support for it in a mystical interpretation of certain passages of scripture thus origen in levit horn ix 10 c.b xxix 438 says ab oriente tibi propitiatio venit inde est enim vir cui oriens nomen est zech 6 12 imitaris ergo per hoc ut ad orientem semper adspicias unde tibi oritur soliustitiae 33 mai 4 2 another text is adduced in support of the practice in didascalia apostolorum ch xii ed r h connolly 1 19 120 for it is required that you pray toward the east as knowing that which is written give ye glory to god who rideth upon the heaven of heavens towards the east ps 67 68 33 5s yet another passage of scripture is laid hold of by gregory of nyssa in oratione dominica v p.g xliv 1184 where the argument is that since paradise was in the east gen 2 8 therefore when we turn to the east in prayer we ask the second adam to restore to us what the first adam lost at a much later date c 743 john of damascus de fide orthodoxy iv 12 p.g xciv 1133 1136 repeats the texts from zechariah malachi and genesis and adds other reasons for the custom namely that when christ was on the cross his face was turned to the west hence when we adore him we turn to the east and that when he ascended into heaven he was borne towards the east and so will come in like manner quoting matt 24 27 candidates for baptism faced west when they were renounc ing satan in professing the creed they faced east the region of light

is speaking of private prayer it seems almost certain that he has in mind a liturgical formula corresponding to the gloria patri at a later date basil de spiritu sancto in discussing different forms of this formula seems to imply section 71 that in the holy spirit was the most usual ending he refers however to two forms of doxology both of which he used in public worship sometimes glorifying god the father in fellowship with ju era the son together with ow the spirit and at others using the prepositions as origen here through the son and in the holy spirit basil's preference is for the former of these two forms since he wrote subsequently to the arian heresy and it was desirable not to give a loophole to those who denied that the son and the holy spirit are co essential with the father he proceeds to cite many authorities in the past who used the phrase together with the holy spirit among them origen in many of his expositions of the psalms i have failed to find an example of this in the extant fragments of this work basil then goes on to say of origen ch 73 that the opinions he held concerning the holy spirit were not always and everywhere sound never theless in many passages even he reverently recognizes the force of established usage and expresses himself concerning the spirit in terms consistent with true relirion n.p.n.f viii 46 xxxiii 2 how greatly art thou magnified

particularly to origen's answer to the problem of prayer which had been posed to him by his two friends v 6 that origen however gave the subject a much wider treatment than the problem demanded may suggest that he felt his friends needed to be brought on much further on the whole subject and practice of prayer this may also be suggested in the quotation from phil 3 13 which follows xxxiv very studious lit very fond of learning an epithet that was certainly deserved by ambrose see intro duction p 182 xxxiv pray for us with a christian tactfulness worthy of paul origen gives the impression that it is he who needs his friends prayers xxxiv to treat again of these matters we have no reason to think that origen ever wrote again specifically on the subject of prayer the de oratione was in fact no mean contribution to it and was much fuller than the treatises of tertullian and of cyprian which preceded and followed it in point of time the apologetic tone of the concluding words you will read this book with indulgence if not merely a conventional phrase may point to the haste and consequent defects in arrangement of which origen was conscious as he surveyed his completed task exhortation to martyrdom introduction early in a.d 235 the soldier maximin led a successful revolt against the regime of severus alexander last of the syrian emperors who was killed on the rhine frontier severus alexander had been friendly to the church his wife mamaea when on one occasion she was staying at antioch had sent for origen and asked him theological ques tions 1 according to the historia augusta there was a private chapel in the imperial household containing statues of past emperors and great men of history including apollonius of tyana orpheus abraham and christ 2 it was in reaction against this policy of friendliness to the church that maximin began to persecute the christians only the clergy were attacked the church historian eusebius of caesarea says that maximin through ill will towards the house of alexander since it con sisted for the most part of believers raised a persecution order ing the leaders of the church alone to be put to death as being responsible for the teaching of the gospel 3 at rome bishop pontianus and hippolytus were deported to sardinia 4 at the threat of persecution origen wrote his exhortation to martyrdom for his rich patron ambrose who was in deacon's orders and for protoctetus a presbyter of the church at caesarea in palestine the exhortation shows signs of having been written in haste and origen shows little concern for style or ordered arrangement the style is in places verbose and for a modern reader origen's characteristic habit of quoting a text eusebius h.k vi 21 3 4 2 s h a lampridius vita severi 29 s eusebius h.e vi 28 chronic 216 ed helm 4 liber pontificalis i p 4 ed duchesne exhortation to martyrdom 389 from the synoptic gospels in all its possible forms must seem pedantic and irritating nevertheless the work is of high interest because of the insight it gives us into the spirit of the early church under the immediate stress of persecution chapters 1 5 are an introduction in the form of an exposition of isa 28 9 11 this is followed by a warning against idolatry and apostasy chapters 6 10 and an exhortation to stand firm chapters 11 21 the example of the maccabean martyrs which exercised great influence on early christian ideas of true martyrdom is held up in chapters 22 27 origen then writes of the value of death by martyrdom and of baptism of blood as conferring remission of all sins chapters 28 ff he emphasizes the absolute dividing line between the christian and the world 34 ff which means that there can be no compromise chapters 45 46 cf 5 deal with the lax views of those who sought to rationalize the attitude of compromise with the state saying that a mere name is nothing and that to swear by the tyche of the emperor is not a significant act this tendency appears in many gnostic sects such as the simonians origen contra celsum vi 1 1 3 and the followers of prodicus tertullian scorpiace 15 the view that apostasy is a matter of moral indifference is also attributed to basilides 5 the school of valentine was partic ularly exercised by the question clement of alexandria pre serves heracleon's interpretation of luke 12 11 12 confession before the authorities he says is to be made only if necessary and if reason demand 5 origen s closing section chapters 47 to end consists of a final exhortation to courage origen's exhortation is an outstanding witness to the dignity which the early church attributed to martyrdom 7 it was the highest ambition of ignatius of antioch to be torn to pieces by wild beasts at rome no higher reward could be reserved for the christian than the martyr's crown no epithet was too ex alted for him thus for tertullian the glory of the church at rome consisted precisely in the fact that peter and paul had 5 agrippa castor in eusebius h.e iv 7 7 origen horn in ezech ill 4 comm ser in matt 38 possibly this represents the view of the later fol lowers of basilides rather than basilides himself at any rate it is difficult to see how this can be reconciled with the statements of basilides cited by clement strom iv 83 6 strom iv 71 7 for the following cf h delehaye les origiws du culte des martyrs and edition 1933 e lucius die anfdnge des heiligenkults 1904 remains of high value 390 origen died there during the neronian persecution naturally there fore a martyr's death was accepted with joy deo gratias said cyprian of carthage as the proconsul pronounced the death sentence above all the gospel saying luke 12 11 12 was a guaran tee that the martyr before his judges was possessed by the holy spirit it is scarcely surprising that exaggerated claims were made by those who had boldly confessed their faith as vehicles of the spirit they surely had power to remit sins to the lapsed an attitude of mind which caused cyprian much trouble zealots would do all in their power to provoke the authorities and measures had to be taken by church authorities to deny the title of martyr to the provocative such men were regarded as suicides the confessor in prison could be sure of the assiduous visits of the faithful who would bring him food and kiss his chains lucian's satire on the death of peregrinus is a vivid con temporary caricature of these attentions and the abuse to which they could easily lead by death the martyr was assured of an absolute remission of all his sins even a catechumen not yet baptized in water could have all stain of sin washed away by the baptism of blood 8 and could enter paradise in white robes there he joined with all other martyrs and confessors in interceding for the church on earth 9 on the anniversary of his birthday i.e the day when he entered the life of the world to come the faithful would gather at his tomb outside the city and a sermon would be preached on the theme of his noble witness to christ local churches carefully preserved records of the date of each martyr's birth day and the lists they made were the first church calendars the earliest surviving calendar is that used by the church at rome in the middle of the fourth century it is only natural that sometimes the instinct for revenge took hold of the martyrs although this is usually sublimated to the next world with the threat of worse punishment for the per secutors there this psychological reaction seems to have con tributed substantially to the lurid nature of some christian language about hell and that this is a vera causa in tertullian's cf origen exh mart 30 39 9 cf origen exh mart 37 38 tertullian held that while all other christians remained in hades till the last judgment martyrs were at once admitted to paradise see j h waszink's commentary on tertul lian de anima 55 exhortation to martyrdom 391 mind is obvious from the well known last chapter of his de spectaculis the idea is implied in the common notion that at the last day the martyr will sit in judgment on those who were his judges on earth cf origen exh mart 28 the particular value of martyrdom consisted in that the martyr knew himself to be in mystical union with his lord in his passion origen when seventeen years of age had lost his father in the persecution of septimius severus and was only prevented from going out to martyrdom himself by the fact that his mother concealed his clothes eusebius h.e vi 2 5 this experience he never forgot origen always prized per secution because it revealed who in the church were true believers writing in the period of peace before the decian per secution broke out he looks wistfully back to the days of conflict with the government that was the time when christians really were faithful when the noble martyrdoms were taking place when after conducting the martyrs bodies to the cemeteries we returned thence to meet together and the entire church was present without being afraid and the catechumens were being catechized during the very time of the martyrdoms and while men were dying who had confessed the truth unto death then we knew and saw wonderful and miraculous signs then there were true believers few in number but truly faithful treading the strait and narrow way which leads to life but now when we have become many out of the multitude who profess piety there are extremely few who are attaining to the election of god and to blessedness 10 only the martyr felt origen truly followed christ and was in union with him the disciple who takes up his cross and follows jesus attains he says to an immediate knowledge of god whom he sees face to face 11 this is a belief fundamental to origen's ideas about the nature of the church and of the spiritual life it is for this reason that origen's exhortation to martyrdom is so moving a document and tells us so much of the spirit of the early church the exhortation to martyrdom is preserved in two greek manu scripts at paris and venice codex paris suppl gr 616 dated 1339 of this there are also two copies and codex venet 10 horn in jerem iv 3 11 exh mart 13 the importance of this background for understanding origen's mystical language is admirably brought out by j lebreton la source et le caractere de la mystique d'orig ne in analecta bollandiana lxvii

remarkable note in his hand expressing the fervour of his admiration for origen vhich had led him to seek everywhere for copies of his works see koetschau's edition p xvii exhortation to martyrdom the text i you who have been weaned from milk who have been drawn away from the breast expect tribulation upon tribula tion expect hope upon hope a little longer a little longer be cause of the scorn of lips by another tongue 1 and you most reverend ambrose and most religious pro toctetus as being no longer carnal nor being babes in christ 2 who have advanced in your spiritual age 3 and have no more need of milk but of solid food 4 are according to isaiah's words as those who have been weaned from milk and drawn away from the breast hear how the prophet foretells for athletes who have been weaned not merely tribulation but a tribula tion upon tribulation but he who does not refuse tribulation upon tribulation but accepts it like a noble athlete immedi ately receives also hope upon hope which he will enjoy after but a short time of the tribulation upon tribulation for that is the meaning of a little longer a little longer 2 even if we are scorned and despised by those who treat us as blasphemers and fools and who are strangers to the language of the holy scriptures let us remember that the hope upon hope which after a little while will be given to us is to be given be cause of the scorn of lips by another tongue and who would not gladly receive tribulation upon tribulation if he is at once to receive also hope upon hope reckoning with paul that the sufferings of this present time by which as it were we buy our salvation are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us 5 by god so much the more in fact since our light affliction which is but for a moment light not i isa 28 9 11 2 cf i cor 3 1 3 qf luke 2 52 4 heb 5 12 5 rom 8 18 393 394 origen merely in words but also in fact for those who are not depressed by the difficulties works in us a weight of eternal glory 6 which is greater in proportion to the severity of the affliction this is true if at the very moment when we are attacked by those who afflict us and desire so to speak to press down our souls we turn our mind away from the troubles and fix our gaze not on the tribulations that are upon us but on the re wards which by god's grace are laid up for those who have striven lawfully 7 in christ because they have borne affliction patiently for god multiplies the benefits and grants far greater favours than are deserved by the distress experienced by the man who fights through it this is in character for him who makes his gifts not in any miserly fashion but with generosity and understanding to those who to the best of their ability have shown by their scorn for their earthen vessel 8 that they love him with all their soul 3 i think that they love god with all their soul who with a great desire to be in union with god withdraw and separate their soul not only from the earthly body but also from every thing material such men accept the putting away of the body of humiliation 9 without distress or emotion when the time come for them to put off the body of death by what is commonly regarded as death then they may be heard to pray with the apostle saying o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from this body of death 10 who among those who groan in this tabernacle because they are weighed down by the cor ruptible body 11 will not also first give thanks saying who shall deliver me from this body of death he sees that by his con fession 12 he has been delivered from the body of death and with holy lips will cry thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord 13 if this seems difficult to anyone it is because he has not been athirst for the living god the strong god nor has he longed for god like as the hart desires the water springs nor has he said when shall i come and appear in the presence of god nor has he considered in his mind as the prophet did when it was said to him every day where is thy god and he poured out his heart upon himself and rebuked it because it was still weak overcome by sadness and distressed saying e ii cor

place of the wonderful taber nacle as far as the house of god with a voice of rejoicing and of confession of a festal sound 14 4 i beseech you therefore throughout the present conflict to remember the great reward laid up in the heavens for those who are persecuted and reviled for righteousness sake and for the son of man's sake 15 and that you rejoice and be glad and exult just as the apostles rejoiced when on one occasion they were counted worthy to suffer insults for his name 16 and if sometimes you feel anguish in your soul may the mind of christ within us speak to the soul even though desire does everything possible to confuse even this mind of christ saying why art thou sad o my soul and why do you disquiet me put thy trust in god for i will make confession of him 17 and again i pray that our souls may never be troubled but that even before the tribunals and before the swords unsheathed to behead us they may be kept by the peace of god which passes all understanding 18 and may enjoy tranquillity reckoning that those who are absent from the body are present with the lord 19 of the universe himself but if we have not such courage as to re main always without anxiety at least let the distress of our soul be not displayed nor apparent to the pagan onlookers that we may be able to defend ourselves to god saying to him o god my soul is vexed within me 20 the word exhorts us to remember also the words of isaiah as follows fear not the reproach of men and be not cast down by their contempt 21 moreover since god manifestly watches over the movement of the heaven and the stars in it and over that which takes place by his divine arrangement in earth and sea in the birth and nourishment of all kinds of animals and in the origin and growth of all plants it would be absurd for us to shut our eyes and not to look to god but in fear to turn our eyes upon men who will shortly die and be handed over to the punishment they deserve 5 god once said to abraham get out of thy land 22 perhaps it will shortly be said to us get out of the earth altogether and it will be good to obey the command so that god may quickly show us the heavens in which is the kingdom of heaven as it is called we can readily perceive that life is full of conflicts and of men engaged in a struggle concerning the n ps 42 4i 2 3 ii is 15 cf matt 5 10 12 luke 6 23 16 acts 5 41 i ps 42 41

control and some have died a heroic death because of their loyalty to the common master of all men men eminent in philosophical in quiry have been anxious to be prudent men who have made it their purpose to live rightly have devoted themselves to right eousness indeed each virtue is opposed either by the carnal mind or by many attacks from external sources but the only people to fight for religion are the elect race the royal priest hood the holy nation a people for god's possession 24 the rest of mankind do not even try to make it appear that if there is persecution of religious people they intend to die for religion and to prefer death rather than deny their religion and live and each one of those who wish to be members of the elect race is convinced that at all times even when he is attacked by those who are supposed to be polytheists but are really atheists he must listen to god who says thou shalt have none other gods but me 25 and the name of other gods ye shall not remember in your hearts nor mention with your mouth 26 accordingly such people believe in god with the heart unto righteousness and with the mouth make confession unto salvation 27 they are aware that they are not granted righteousness until they so believe in god that their heart remains unmoved and that they will not be saved unless their word corresponds to their inner conviction they deceive themselves who suppose that it is sufficient for the attainment of the end in christ if with the heart they believe unto righteousness omitting the words but with the mouth confession is made unto salvation indeed i would go so far as to say that it is better to honour god with hps when one's heart is far from god 28 than to honour him with the heart and not to make confession with the mouth unto salvation 6 god who commands thou shalt not make for thyself an idol nor any image of anything 29 and so on appears to dis tinguish between thou shalt not bow down to them and thou shalt not worship them accordingly perhaps he who believes in idols may worship them but he who does not believe in them moved by cowardice to make a pretence which he calls accommodating himself 30 so as to seem to be religious like the 23 cf deut 32 9 24 ex ig 6 i p e t 2 9 25 ex 20 3 26 ex 23 13 27 rom 10 10 28 i s a 2 q iq 29 ex 20 4 5 y 3q cf origen contra celstm vii 66 with my note thereon for the attitude of the gnostic sects in time of persecution see above introduction p 389 exhortation to martyrdom 397 multitude does not worship the idols but only bows down to them and i would say that those who abjure christianity at the tribunal or even before arriving there do not worship the idols but only bow down to them taking the name of the lord and applying the word god to vain and lifeless matter in their matter also the people defiled with the daughters of moab 31 bowed down to idols but did not worship them at any rate scripture says in these very words they called them to the sacrifices of their idols and the people ate of their sacrifices and bowed down to their idols and were initiated into beelphegor 32 notice that it does not say and they worshipped their idols for it was impossible that after such remarkable signs and wonders they should be persuaded in an instant by the women with whom they committed fornication to believe that the idols were gods perhaps in the same way also at the making of the calf in exodus they bowed down but did not worship the calf which they had watched being made 33 we must therefore regard the present temptation as a trial and test of our love for god for the lord tempts you as it is written in deuteronomy to know whether you love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul 34 but you when you are tempted will follow the lord your god and will fear him and keep his commandments especially noting the precept thou shalt have none other gods but me and you will hear his voice and obey him who takes you from this earthly region and attaches you to himself for the increase of god 35 in him to use the apostle's language 7 but if every evil word is an abomination to the lord thy god 36 what abomination must be the evil word of denial and the evil word that calls upon another god and the evil oath by the fortune of men a word that corresponds to no reality 37 when this oath is required of us let us remember him who taught us but i say unto you swear not at all 38 for if he who swears by heaven insults the throne of god and if he who swears by earth utters blasphemy by making a god of what is called god's footstool and if he who swears by jerusalem sins even though it is a city of a great king and if he who swears by his own head 39 is doing wrong how great a sin must we think it 3i num 25

the enemy wishes to use every argu ment in his power to make us worship the sun or the moon or all the host of heaven 41 but we will reply that the word of god has not commanded this 53 we ought on no account to worship the creatures in the presence of the creator 42 who is sufficient for and anticipates the prayer of all nor indeed would the sun himself wish to be worshipped by those who belong to the por tion of god 43 and probably not even by anyone else but he might imitate him who said why do you call me good there is none good but the one god the father 44 and as it were say to him who desires to worship him why do you call me god there is one true god and why do you bow down to me thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve 45 1 also am a created being why do

concerned to help his bride to live chastely to bring all her affection towards her husband and to take every precaution to avoid another man if he is wise will show some jealousy and will adopt this attitude to his bride as a precautionary remedy so also the lawgiver especially if it be clear that he is the firstborn of all creation 5 i says to the soul betrothed to god that he is jealous his purpose is to separate the hearers from all fornication with daemons and with the sup posed gods it is as a jealous god that he says of those who have in any way gone a whoring after other gods they provoked me to jealousy against that which is not god they made me wrathful against their idols and i will provoke them to jealousy with people who are not a nation i will make them wrathful against a foolish nation for the fire is kindled from my anger and it shall burn to the bottom of hades 52 10 if it is not for his own sake that the husband wise and without passion seeks to turn his betrothed from all defilement it is for her sake because he sees her defilement and impurity he will do all in his power to cure and convert her to her free will he will speak words to dissuade her from fornication what worse pollution for the soul can one imagine than to call upon another god and not to confess the one true and only lord i believe that just as he who is joined to a harlot is one body 53 so also he who confesses faith in any god especially at a time of persecution and trial of faith is mingled and united with the god whom he confesses he who denies is separated by the very act of denial like a cutting sword from him whom he denies he suffers alienation and is severed from him whom he has denied consider therefore the scripture whosoever confesses me be fore men him shall i confess before my father in heaven and whosoever denies me before men him shall i deny before my father in heaven 54 this implies that it necessarily and in evitably follows that he who confesses is confessed and he who denies is denied the very logos and very truth might say both to him who confesses and him who denies the measure you apply to others is the measure that shall be applied to you 55 you therefore who have measured with the measure of confession of faith in me and have fulfilled 56 the measure of the confession will receive the measure of my confession shaken 5i col 1 15 52

corresponding to the denial you have made of me 11 let us in this way consider how the measure of confession may be filled up or how it may be not filled but left deficient if throughout the time of trial and temptation we give no place in our hearts to the devil 58 who wishes to defile us with evil thoughts of denial or hesitancy or some plausible argument which may tempt us to the very opposite of martyrdom and perfection and if furthermore we pollute ourselves by not a word contrary to our profession and if we bear all the ad versaries 5 reproach and mockery and laughter and slander and the pity which they think they have for us imagining us dupes and fools and calling us deluded if moreover we are not dis tracted or held even by affection for our children or for their mother or for one of those whom we regard as our dearest friends in this life so as to value their possession and to prize our earthly life but turn away from these ties and become wholly dedicated to god and to living in his company and presence that we may share communion with his only begotten son and those who participate in him 59 then i would affirm that we have fulfilled the measure of the confession but if we fall short even in any one point we have not fulfilled it but have defiled the measure of our confession and have adulterated it with something foreign in that case we shall be lacking in the same way as those who have built upon the foundation wood or hay or stubble 60 12 we must also realize that we have received the so called covenants of god on conditions set forth in the agreements which we made with him when we first took upon us to live the christian life and among the terms of our agreement with god was the entire way of life set forth in the gospel which says if any man will follow me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever wishes to save his life shall lose it and whosoever loses his life for my sake he will save it 61 and often we have been filled with enthusiasm on hearing the words for what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul for when the son of

lose his life for my sake he shall save it for what will it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose or forfeit himself 63 mark says and calling the crowd with his dis ciples he said to them if any man wishes to follow me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever wishes to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose it for the gospel's sake shall save

longer i who live 65 now it is revealed whether or not we have taken up our cross and followed jesus this will have happened if christ is living in us if we wish to save our soul so that we may receive it back as better than a soul 66 let us lose it even by martyrdom for if we lose it for christ's sake throwing it at his feet in dying for him we acquire its true salvation but if we do the opposite then we shall hear that it does not profit one who gains the whole material world at the price of losing or for feiting himself once a man has lost his own soul or forfeited it even if he gain the whole world it will not be possible for him to pay anything in exchange for the soul he has lost for the soul created in the image of god 67 is more precious than any thing material one

and hasten towards him who has called you then as never before you will comprehend face to face 3 70 as friends of the heavenly father who is your teacher friends know not by obscure hints or by mere knowledge of sounds and words symbols and types but by a real awareness through which they attain to the nature of the intelligible world and to the beauty of the truth if you believe that paul was caught up to the third heaven and was caught up to paradise and heard unspeakable words which man cannot utter 71 you will accordingly realize that you will have immediate know ledge of more and greater matters than the unspeakable words revealed to paul for after receiving them he descended from the third heaven whereas after you have acquired this know ledge you will not descend again if you take up your cross and follow jesus whom we have as a great high priest who has passed through the heavens 3 72 and if you do not fall away from those who follow him you yourselves shall pass through the heavens passing not merely above earth and the mysteries of earth but even above the heavens and their mysteries for in god there are treasured up much greater visions than these which no being with a material body can perceive before it is separated from every contact with matter for i am persuaded that god is keeping and storing in himself far greater wonders than are seen by sun moon and the choir of stars and even by the holy angels whom god made spirit and flame of fire 73 so that he may reveal them when the whole creation is liberated from the bondage of the enemy to the liberty of the glory of the children of god 74 14 and to those exalted heights 75 the ascent will be quickly made by one of those first martyrs who have a christian love of learning surpassing many

manifold 78 or as mark says a hundredfold 7 which is far more than the little we leave behind which if we are called to martyrdom is multiplied a hundred times therefore if i am to be a martyr i would wish to leave chil dren and lands and houses that with the god and father of our lord jesus christ from whom all fatherhood in heaven and earth is named 80 1 may be called father of children many times more numerous and holy or to give an exact figure of a hundred times more children if there are fathers such as are mentioned in the words spoken to abraham but thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace having lived to a good old age 81 someone might say whether the suggestion is right or wrong i do not know perhaps there are fathers who once bore witness and left children and in exchange for these they have become the fathers of the patriarch abraham and of other patriarchs for it is probable that those who have left children by bearing their witness become fathers not of infants but of fathers 15 if anyone who as it were desires the greatest gifts and blesses the martyrs as rich men and fathers who will beget a hundred times more children and will receive a hundred times more lands and houses asks if it is reasonable that they should obtain a far larger inheritance in the spiritual world than those who were poor in this life my reply to him is this just as those who have endured torments and agony have shown a more dis tinguished virtue by their martyrdom than those who have not been tried in this way so also those who besides their normal attachment to the material world and for this life have cut free from very strong worldly ties because of their profound love for 76 ve expect the son elsewhere origen quotes this text in the usual form 77 matt 19 27 29 78 matt 19 29 79

1 6 notice at the same time the gravity of the scripture which promises multiplication even to a hundred times of brothers children parents lands and homes but a wife is not included in this list for scripture does not say everyone who has left brothers or sisters or parents or children or lands or houses or a wife for my sake will receive manifold reward for at the resurrection of the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels in heaven 84 1 7 the scripture might say to us now what joshua said to the people when bringing them to settle in the holy land the text reads as follows now fear the lord and serve in truth and righteousness 85 if we are being pressed to idolatry the next words also would be applicable destroy the foreign gods whom your fathers worshipped on the far side of the river and in egypt and worship the lord 86 at the beginning when you were to be instructed in the christian faith it would have been reasonable to say to you if you do not wish to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods of your fathers on the far side of the river or the gods of the amorites among whom you inhabit the land and the

made and who is alien to salvation what are we to say of those who by denial abrogate the agreements they have made with god and return to satan whom they renounced at their baptism to this we should

alive until now 8 who could more justi fiably be praised for his death than he who of his own free choice chooses to die for the sake of religion such a man was eleazar who welcomed death with honour rather than life with pollu tion and of his own free choice went forward to the instrument of torture he with a noble resolution worthy of his ninety years and the eminence of his age and the grey hairs marking the distinction to which he had attained and his noble up bringing since childhood and even more of the holy laws appointed by god 9 said it does not become my age to make a pretence so that many of the young men will suppose that eleazar at the age of ninety has gone over to a foreign religion they would be led astray by my pretence and for the sake of a short and brief period of life and i should win for my old age pollution and disgrace even if at the present time i escape the punishment of men yet i shall not escape the hands of the al mighty whether alive or dead therefore

known that though i could have been freed from death i am enduring cruel bodily pains by scourging and in my soul i suffer this gladly for fear of him such indeed was the death of eleazar that it was said of him he left his death as an example of nobility and a memorial of virtue not only to the young but also to the nation as a whole 11 23 the seven brothers described in the books of macca bees 12 whom antiochus tortured with whips and scourges 5 because of their loyal adherence to their religion constitute a magnificent example of courageous martyrdom to everyone who considers whether he will be inferior to children who not only endured tortures one by one but also showed how stedfastly they adhered to their religion by witnessing the sufferings of their brothers one of them who is called in scripture their spokesman said to the tyrant why question us what will you learn for we are ready to die rather than to transgress the laws of our fathers i need not mention what they suffered from heated pans and cauldrons by which they were tortured after each had endured some different torment for first he who was called their spokesman had his tongue cut out then his head was scorched and he endured the scorching as others undergo the circumcision appointed by god's law believing that even in this way he was fulfilling the intention of the covenant of god 13 not content with this antiochus had his hands and feet cut off while his other brothers and his mother looked on wanting to punish his brothers and mother by the sight and supposing that he would move them from their resolve by these terrible torments indeed not content with crippling his body by the first tortures antiochus ordered him to be put on the fire while still alive and fried in the pans and cauldrons and as the vapour of the flesh of the noble athlete of piety roasting by the cruelty of the tyrant spread abroad the others 10 ii maccabees 6 24 28 11 ii maccabees 6 30 31 12 ii maccabees 7 13 origen seems to be thinking of the maccabean martyr's death as the jewish equivalent of the christian baptism by blood baptism being the equivalent under the new covenant of circumcision under the old exhortation to martyrdom 4.09 exhorted one another with their mother to die nobly comforting each other with the thought that god was seeing it all sufficient to steel them to endurance was the conviction that the eye of god was upon them in their suffering and the leader of the athletes of piety exhorted them being himself encouraged and so to speak filled with rejoicing by the heroism of their resist ance to such fearful agonies if we were in such a situation we might well repeat the words they said to each other which read as follows the lord god beholds us and in reality is having compassion on us 24 after the first had been tested in this manner as gold is proved in the crucible the second was brought to the torture after the ministers of the tyrant's cruelty had torn off his skin with the hair they called upon him to change his mind asking their victim if he would eat meat offered to idols before his body was punished limb by limb when he refused to change his mind he was led to the next torture and remained stedfast to his last gasp he in no way broke down or yielded to the tor ments but said to the blasphemer you criminal you remove us from this present life but the king of the world shall raise us up to everlasting life because we have died for his laws 25 the third also counting his sufferings as nothing and for his love to god trampling upon them when told to put out his tongue did so forthwith and valiantly stretched out his hands saying because of god's laws i leave these behind me but i hope to regain from god the rewards he grants to those who have fought for their religion likewise the fourth was tortured and endured the blows saying when we die at the hands of men it is better to look to the hopes we have of god that we shall be raised up by him in a resurrection the tyrant will not know for he will rise not to life but to reproach and everlasting shame next the fifth was tormented looking at antiochus he re viled him for that his corruptibility had not lessened his pride and that he supposed tyrannical power held for a few days was great authority while being tortured he said that his race had not been deserted by god who would inflict far worse torments on antiochus and his seed after him the sixth at the point of dying said do not deceive yourself we are paying the penalty of our sins and are enduring these sufferings willingly in order that by them we may be purified and he said to the king that he must not imagine that he would go unpunished for daring to fight against god 410 origen for he who fights against those made divine by the word is fighting god 26 lastly antiochus took the youngest in his hands and being persuaded that he was a brother of those who counted such terrible agonies for nothing and that he had the same resolve as they used other methods he thought he might be won over by exhortations and swore oaths promising to make him rich and happy if he would abandon his ancestral laws and to enrol him among the friends 14 and to entrust him with imperial offices but as he had no success whatever and the young man did not even listen to his words as being alien to his resolve he appealed to his mother exhorting her to advise the boy to save himself but she while agreeing to persuade her son to do what he wanted mocked the tyrant by giving her son many exhortations to endurance so that the boy did not wait for the punishment to be brought to him but took the initiative and called to the torturers saying what are you waiting for why are you so slow for we obey the law given by god we must not accept a command contrary to god's words more over like a king pronouncing sentence on those subject to his judgment he pronounced sentence against the tyrant being judge of him rather than being judged by him and he told him that for having raised his hands against the children of heaven he would not escape the judgment of almighty god who sees everything 27 at that moment one could have seen how the mother of these heroes for her hope in god bravely bore the torments and deaths of her sons for the dew of piety and the cool breath of holiness did not allow to be kindled within her her maternal instinct which in most mothers faced with such severe pains would have been a burning fire i believe that this story which i have quoted from the scripture in abbreviated form is most valuable for our purpose it enables us to see how piety and love for god in face of the most painful agonies and the severest torments is far more powerful than any other bond of affection this love for god and human weakness cannot dwell together in us weakness is exiled and altogether driven out of our soul and is rendered entirely impotent where a man can say the lord is my strength and my song and i can do all things through christ jesus our lord who strengthens me 15 28 the value of martyrdom and the boldness it gives us n a title of honour given to the highest royal officials is ps 118 117 114 phil 4 13 exhortation to martyrdom 411 before god we can also learn from this consideration the saint who possesses a certain ambition and desires to offer something in return for the benefits that come to him from god asks what he can do to the lord for all that he has received from him and he finds that a man with a grateful heart can render to god nothing else capable of being as it were a counterweight to his benefits except a martyr's death for in the 1151 1 psalm there is first the question what shall i render to the lord for all the benefits he has done to me the answer to him who asks what he should render to the lord for all the benefits he has received from him reads as follows i will take the cup of salvation and will call upon the name of the lord 16 the cup of salvation is the usual name for martyrdom as we find in the gospel for when those who are ambitious for greater honour desire to sit on the right and left of jesus in his kingdom the lord says to them can you drink of the cup that i drink n by cup he means martyrdom this is clear from the saying father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done i we learn besides that he who drinks of that cup that jesus drank will sit and rule and judge with the king of kings 19 this then is the cup of salvation and he who receives it will call upon the name of the lord and everyone that calls upon the name of the lord shall be saved 20 29 but perhaps on account of the words father if it be possible let this cup pass from me someone who did not ex amine the meaning of scripture closely might think that as it were even the saviour was afraid in the hour of the passion 21 but if he was afraid one might say who ever was courageous in the first place we will ask those who hold this view of the saviour if he was inferior to him who said the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the pro tector of my life of whom shall i be afraid when evil men approached me to eat up my flesh those who persecuted me and my enemies were struck with weakness and fell if a host should be drawn up against me my heart shall not be afraid if war should rise up against me then will i be full of hope 22 but 16 ps 116 115 3 4 17 matt 20 22 mark 10 38 is mark 14 36 is gf i cor 6 2 hippolytus 72 dan ii 37 cyprian ep 6 dionysius of alexandria in eusebius h.e vi 42 5 20 joel 2 32 21 cf celsius in origen contra celsum ii 24 why then does he utter loud laments and waitings and pray that he may avoid the fear of death saying something like this o father if this cup could pass by me 22 p st 27 26 1 3 412 origen perhaps these words reported by the prophet are spoken by none other than the saviour since by reason of the light and salva tion given to him by the father he fears no man and because of the protection granted by god he is afraid of none his heart was in no way fearful when the entire host of satan was drawn up against him when war rose up against him his heart hoped in god being filled with his holy doctrines it would not be in character for the same person to say in a cowardly spirit father if it be possible let this cup pass from me and to say courageously if a host be drawn up against me my heart shall not be afraid lest we miss some point in the passage notice the express designation of the cup in the three evangelists according to matthew the lord said father if it be possible let this cup pass from me luke has father if it be thy will take this cup away from me mark has abba father all things are pos sible to thee take this cup away from me 23 consider then seeing that any martyrdom by death suffered for any cause whatever is called a cup whether you could affirm that it is not martyrdom in general that he is putting from him when he says let this cup pass from me otherwise he would have said let the cup pass from me but perhaps only this particular kind consider also the possibility that the saviour had in mind the various kinds of cup so to speak and the possible results of each one and because by a certain very profound wisdom he under stood the differences asked that this kind of martyr's death might be avoided while secretly he made request for another which would have been even more of an ordeal so that by a different cup he might achieve an even wider diffusion of bene fits which would reach more people this however was not the will of the father who with a wisdom greater than the will of his son and a vision wider than the saviour's was controlling events to follow an ordered path it is at any rate clear that in the psalms the cup of salvation is the death of the martyrs that is why i will take the cup of salvation and will call upon the name of the lord is followed by the words precious in the lord's sight is the death of his saints 24 to us then as god's saints who are not unworthy there comes a precious death in that our death is of some special significance if it is endured for the sake of christianity and piety and holiness 30 let us also remember the sins we have committed that remission of sins cannot be obtained without baptism that 23 matt 26 39 luke 22 42 mark 14 36 24 p s n6 ii5 is 15 exhortation to martyrdom 413 according to the laws of the gospel it is not possible again to be baptized with water and the spirit for remission of sins and that a baptism of martyrdom has been given to us that this name is given to it is clear from the fact that after the saying can you drink of the cup that i drink there follow the words or be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with 25 and elsewhere it is said i have a baptism to be baptized with and how am i straitened until it be accomplished 26 consider whether just as the saviour's death brought purification to the world the baptism of martyrdom may also by the service of those who undergo it bring purification to many just as those who attend at the altar according to the law of moses thought they obtained remissions of sins for the jews by the blood of bulls and goats 27 so the souls of those who have been beheaded for the testimony of jesus 28 do not attend in vain at the heavenly altar but mediate remission of sins to those who pray at the same time we know that just as the high priest jesus christ offered himself in sacrifice 29 so the priests whose high priest he is offer themselves in sacrifice and therefore appear by the altar in their proper place those priests who are blameless and offer blameless sacrifices used to serve the worship of god but those who were at fault as moses set out in leviticus 30 were ban ished from the altar who then is the blameless priest who offers a blameless offering other than he who holds fast the confession and fulfils every requirement made by the doctrine of martyr dom this point we have discussed above 31 31 let us not be surprised that the wonderful blessedness of the martyrs who enjoy deep peace and calm and rest has to be begun in apparently dark and so to speak wintry weather it is by journeying in this life on the strait and narrow way 32 in winter that each one of the blessed will have to show what ability he has gained for following the right road so that after this life there may be fulfilled the word in the song of songs spoken to the bride who has come through the winter my beloved she says answers and says to me arise come my friend my lovely my dove behold the winter is past the rain has dispersed and gone away 33 you also should remember that you cannot hear that the winter is past unless you have battled bravely and manfully with the present winter after the 25 mark 10 38 2 s luke 12 50 27 heb 9 13 10 4 28 rev 20 4 6 9 29 heb 5 1 7 27 8 3 10 12 30 lev 21 17 21 31 chapter n 32 matt 7 14 33 s ofsol 2 10 11 414 origen winter is past and rain has gone away and dispersed the flowers will appear planted in the house of the lord they shall flower in the halls of our god 5 34 312 and this we know that if we have been persuaded by jesus to forsake the idols and polytheistic atheism the enemy cannot persuade us to commit idolatry but he wants to compel us and on this account he brings this pressure to bear on those over whom he has power and either makes martyrs or idolaters of those who are tempted by him frequently even now he says all these things will i give you if you will fall down and wor ship me 35 let us therefore take heed lest we commit idolatry and subject ourselves to daemons for the gods of the heathen are daemons 36 what a terrible thing it is when a man forsakes christ's easy yoke and light burden 37 and again subjects himself to the yoke of daemons and bears a burden of the gravest sin after we have known that the heart of idol worshippers is ash and their life more worthless than dust 38 and after we have spoken the words how false are the idols our fathers possessed and there is none among them that can make it rain 39 33 it was not merely in ancient times that nebuchadnezzar set up the golden image nor merely then that he threatened ananias azarias and misael that if they would not bow down he would cast them into the fiery furnace 40 even now nebu chadnezzar is saying the very same thing to us the true hebrews whose home is in the next world 41 but we that we may experi ence the heavenly dew which quenches all fire in us and re freshes our mind let us imitate those holy men lest even now haman may wish you mordecais to bow down to him and you reply to him i will not place the glory of men higher than the glory of the god of israel 42 let us destroy bel by the word of god and kill the dragon with daniel 43 that when we draw near to the mouths of lions we can suffer no harm from them and that only those responsible for our present conflict may be eaten up by the lions which cannot consume us let us be encouraged by the fact that among the good deeds of job we read these words if 44 1 laid my hand on my mouth to kiss let this also be 34 ps 92 gi i3 35 matt 4 9 3 p s 96 95 15 37 matt 11 30 38 wisdom of solomon 15 10 39 jer 16 19 14 22 40 dan 3 1 ff 41 philo migr abrah 20 similarly

the greatest crime for it is probable that they will require us to put our hand on our mouth to give a kiss 34 this also let us notice that the saviour's prophecies about martyrdom do not occur in the words he addressed to the multitude but to the apostles for after scripture has first said jesus sent out these twelve commanding them do not go into the way of the gentiles 55 and so on there follow these words beware of men for they shall deliver you to the councils and shall beat you in their synagogues and you shall be led before governors and kings for my sake for a witness to them and to the gentiles but when they give you up do not be anxious how or what you should speak for it is not you that speak but the spirit of the father speaking in you brother shall betray brother to death a father his child and children shall rise up against their parents and have them killed and you shall be hated by all men for my name's sake but he who endures to the end shall be saved when they persecute you in one city flee to the next and if they chase you out of that escape to another verily i say to you you shall not complete all the cities of israel before the son of man come 46 and luke writes as follows when they bring you before synagogues and rulers and authorities do not be anxious how you should reply or what you should say for the holy spirit will teach you in that hour what you ought to say 55 and after other sayings settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to withstand or gainsay but you shall be delivered up even by parents and brethren and kinsfolk and friends and some of you they shall cause to be put to death and you shall be hated by all men for my name's sake and not a hair of your head shall perish in your patience possess your souls 5 47 this is mark's account when they lead you to judgment and deliver you up do not be anxious beforehand or meditate beforehand but speak that which is given you in that hour for it is not you that speak but the holy spirit and brother shall deliver up brother to his death and the father his child and children shall rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death and you shall be hated by all men for my name's sake but he that endures to the end shall be saved 48 45 job 31 27 28 the kiss required is an act of loyalty to the heathen god 4 matt 10 5 17 23 47 luke 12 11 12 21 14 19 48 mark 13 1 13 416 origen the following exhortations to martyrdom in matthew are not addressed to any but the twelve we too must hear them and by so doing we shall be brothers of the apostles who heard them and be numbered with the apostles the passage reads as fol lows fear not those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul fear rather him who can destroy both soul and body in gehenna and after this the lord teaches us that it is not with out divine providence that anyone comes to face the conflict of martyrdom for he says are not two sparrows sold for a farthing yet not one of them will fall to the earth without the father who is in heaven the hairs of your head are all num bered fear not therefore you are of more value than many sparrows everyone who confesses me before men will i also confess before my father who is in heaven but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father who is in heaven 49 luke's words are to the same effect this i say to you my friends fear not those who kill the body and after that have power to do nothing further i will show you whom you shall fear fear him who after killing you has power to cast you into gehenna yea i say to you fear him are not five sparrows sold for two farthings yet not one of them is forgotten before god but even the hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore you are of more value than many sparrows and i say to you everyone who confesses me before men the son of man will also confess before the angels of god but he who denies me before men shall be denied before the angels of god 50 and in another place whosoever is ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and in that of the father and the holy angels 51 in the same sense mark also wrote as follows who soever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of the father with the holy angels 52 those who destroy us kill the life of the body that is the meaning of the saying fear not those who kill the body which matthew and luke have in identical wording for after they have killed the body even if they wish they have no power to kill the soul nor have they power to do anything further for how is it possible to destroy a soul which by the very act of confession is given life witness to it is given by him who exhorts us to martyrdom in isaiah and by his son according to the 49 matt 10 28 33 50 luke 12 4 9 si luke 0 26 mark 8 38 y exhortation to martyrdom 417 scripture be my witnesses and i will be your witness saith the lord god and the son whom i have chosen 53 notice this also that it is not to jesus 5 servants but to his friends 54 that he gives this commandment fear not those who kill the body and after that have power to do nothing further we must fear therefore him who is able to destroy both soul and body in gehenna he alone after killing us has power to cast into gehenna indeed he will cast there those who are terri fied by those who kill the body and those who do not fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in gehenna and who after killing us has power to cast us into gehenna if anyone's hairs are numbered this is obviously true of those who are executed for jesus 5 sake we then will make confession in the son of god even before those who are men and not gods so that he whom we confess may reply to us by confessing us before his god and father he himself confessing in heaven the man who has confessed him on earth 35 who on considering this will not cry out with the apostle the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed to us 55 is not confession before the father much greater than confession before men and is not the confession made in heaven by him who is confessed far superior to the confession on earth of the son of god made by the martyrs let anyone who thinks of denying him before men bear in mind the words of him who does not err i also will deny him before my father who is in heaven matthew's text has i also will confess him before my father who is in heaven while luke has the son of man will also confess him before the angels of god 56 i ask therefore whether the firstborn of all creation the image of the invisible god 57 will confess the man who confesses him before his father in heaven while he who was born of the seed of david accord ing to the flesh 58 and is therefore son of man and was born of a woman 59 who was herself human and on this account is given the title of son of man whom we understand to be the humanity of jesus 60 will confess those who confess him before the angels of god we might say the corresponding thing of those who deny 53 isa 43 10 54 cl john 15 15 55 r om 8

418 origen we must further consider this point he who confesses the son before men so far as in him lies commends christianity and the founder of christianity before those to whom he makes his confession but he who is confessed by the firstborn of all creation and the son of man is commended by the confession of the son of god and the son of man to the father in heaven and the angels of god but if it is not he who commends himself who is approved but he whom the lord commends 61 must we not think him approved who is judged worthy of commenda tion to the father in heaven and the angels of god but if he is approved with those like him whom the lord has tested by tortures and examinations as gold in the crucible and has accepted as a whole burnt offering 62 what must we say of those who have been shown up in the furnace of persecution and have denied these as not being true christians are denied before the father in heaven and before the angels of god by him who denies everyone who deserves it 36 we have to strive not merely against denial but also lest we feel any shame when the enemies of god suppose that we are suffering shameful indignities this is particularly applic able to you holy ambrose honoured and respected by a vast number of cities you are now so to speak walking in the procession bearing the cross of jesus and following him who leads you before governors and kings that he himself may go with you and give a mouth and wisdom to you his companion in the fight protoctetus and to those who bear witness with you who make up that which is lacking in the sufferings of christ 63 he will be with you on the way to the paradise of god and will show you how to pass by the cherubim and the flaming sword which turns and guards the way of the tree of life 64 though both of these guard the way of the tree of life they do so to prevent anyone unworthy from passing through and reaching the tree of hfe for the flaming sword will lay hold of those who have built upon the established foundation jesus christ wood or hay or stubble 65 and the wood so to speak of denial which is quickly kindled and burns rapidly the cherubim will receive those who cannot be caught by the flam ing sword because they have built with nothing inflammable and will conduct them to the tree of life and to all that god 6i ii cor 10 18 62 wisdom of solomon 3 6 col 1 24 64 gen 3

has given you power to trample on serpents and scorpions and on every power of the enemy that nothing should harm you 5 68 37 we must not therefore deny the son of god or be ashamed of him or his servants or his words but listen to the saying whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father who is in heaven and to the saying for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and mine of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the father and the holy angels and to the words for whosoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him shall the son of man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of the father with the holy angels 69 jesus once endured the cross and despised the shame and therefore sat down at the right hand of god 70 his followers also who despise the shame will sit with him and reign in heaven with him who came to bring peace not on the earth but in the soul of his disciples and to bring on the earth a sword 71 for since the word is god is living and active and sharper than any two edged sword and penetrates to the separating of soul and spirit the joints and the marrow and is a judge of the thoughts and intents of the heart 72 he rewards our souls particularly at this present time with the peace that passes all understanding 73 which he left to his apostles 74 but he has thrust a sword between the image of the earthy and the image of the heavenly 75 so that now he takes the heavenly part of us that afterwards if we no longer deserve to be divided into two parts he may make us entirely heavenly and he came to cast not merely a sword on the earth but also fire of this he said i wish it were already kindled 76 let this fire therefore be kindled in you consuming every earthly and carnal thought show all zeal to be baptized now with the baptism concerning which jesus was straitened until it be accomplished and you ambrose since you have wife and children and brothers and sisters remember the words if any 6 gen 2 8 9 7 rom 16 20 luke 10 19 69 matt 10 33 luke 9 26 mark 8 38 70 heb 12 2 8 1 7i matt 10 34 72 heb 4 12 phil 4 7 74 john 14 27 75 i cor 15 49 76

the saying if any man comes to me and does not hate his own soul in addition to those already mentioned he cannot be my disciple 5 78 so hate your own soul that by your hatred you may preserve it to everlasting life for he says he who hates his own soul in this world shall preserve it to everlasting life 3 79 accordingly hate your soul for the sake of everlasting life in the sure conviction that it is a good and valuable hatred which jesus teaches us to have just as we have to hate our soul to pre serve it to everlasting life so also must you ambrose who have wife and children and brothers and sisters hate them you will thus help those you hate since by the very act of hating them you become a friend to god and receive the freedom to benefit them 38 but at the same time remember him who prays in spirit for the children left by the martyrs for the sake of their love for god and said redeem the children of those condemned to death 80 only realize that it is not the children of the flesh who are children of god 81 and that just as it is said to the des cendants of abraham i know that you are abraham's seed 82 and if you were abraham's children you would do the works of abraham 83 so also it will be said to your children i know that you are ambrose's seed and if you are ambrose's children you will do the works of ambrose no doubt they will do them for you will help them more after dying a martyr's death than if you had remained with them for then you will love them with greater knowledge and pray for them with deeper under standing if you find that they are your children and not merely your seed take now upon your lips the words he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me 5 and he who finds his soul shall lose it and he who loses his soul for my sake shall find it 84 39 by your readiness for martyrdom give place to the spirit of your father who speaks in those delivered up for the sake of religion 85 if you know yourselves to be hated and reviled

reproaches and many dangers for christ's sake since the time when you first believed advance by enduring to the end for he who endures to the end shall be saved 5 87 know that according to peter you will rejoice though now for a short time if need be you are grieved by various temptations that the testing of your faith which is far more valuable than perishable gold which is tried by fire may be found to deserve praise and glory and honour at the revelation of jesus christ 88 understand the word grieved to mean suffering physical pain as is clear from the words in grief shalt thou bear children 89 for a woman giving birth to a child suffers no grief whatever but physical pain to christ's disciples this word was helpful love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man loves the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passes away and its lust 90 accordingly do not love that which is transitory but by doing god's will become worthy to be one with son and father and holy spirit in accordance with the saviour's prayer that they also may be one in us as i and thou are one 91 how many days of life can one gain by loving the world or the things that are in the world while losing or destroying one's own soul and carrying a conscience bur dened by a heavy load and weighed down by the guilt of apostasy let us each remember how often we have been in danger of dying in the ordinary way and reckon that we may have been preserved in order that baptized in our own blood and washed from all sin we may dwell beside the heavenly altar with our comrades in the fight 92 40 if however any man is led to yield by a great love for this life or by lack of courage in face of the torments or by the seemingly persuasive arguments used by those who would per suade us to choose the evil course and denies the one god and his christ and confesses the daemons or fortunes 93 let him realize that when he prepares a table for the daemon and fills the cup to fortune he forsakes the lord and forgets his 86 john

himself a christian by words and deeds so that he might have the father also for those who make such a confession have the father 41 if we have passed from death to life 99 by our transition from unbelief to faith let us not be surprised if the world hates us 1 for no one who has not passed from death to life but re mains in death can love those who have passed from the dark house of death so

after the manner of men i have fought with wild beasts at ephesus 5 we could say if after the manner of men i have been executed in germany 6 42 if as the sufferings of christ overflow so through christ consolation also overflows let us gladly accept the sufferings of christ so that they overflow in us if at least we desire the abundant consolation which is received by all who mourn though probably not in equal measure for if the consolation were equal for all scripture would not have said as the suffer ings of christ overflow to us so also our consolation overflows those who share in sufferings will also share in consolation in proportion to the sufferings that they share with christ this you learn from him who with full conviction said for we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings so also do you share in the consolation 9 god says by the prophet in an acceptable time have i heard thee and in a day of salvation have i succoured thee 10 what other time is so acceptable as that when for our faith towards god in christ we are brought in procession under arrest in the world and are led away to die though the triumph is ours rather than theirs for the martyrs in christ put off with him the principalities and powers and join in his triumph 11 as they share in his sufferings so also they share in the benefits of his sufferings these include triumphing over principalities and powers which shortly you shall see vanquished and put to shame what is the day of salvation so much as the day we are delivered from this life but i beseech you give no offence in any thing 12 lest through you the presbyterate or the diaconate be found at fault but in all things commend yourselves as the ministers of god in much patience say and now what is my patience is it

and if we have commended ourselves by honour and have not been made proud by it let us now even endure dishonour and if we have behaved worthily to deserve a good reputation and if we have enjoyed such a reputation let us now tolerate the evil report of the impious moreover if as true men we have been admired by lovers of truth now let us laugh if someone says we are mistaken because we have been delivered from many dangers many have said that we were known of god but now let anyone say that we are un known when probably we are in fact even better known bearing whatever comes we are afflicted but not put to death and while rejoicing are likened to men who are grieved 18 44 paul somewhere says to those who have endured suffering at the first exhorting them to be patient under the second attack of danger for the sake of the word as they were under the first remember the former days when after you were en lightened you endured a severe struggle of suffering being partly an object of public ridicule and affliction and partly being associated with those who were being thus treated more over you sympathized with those in prison and gladly accepted the plunder of your property knowing that you have a better possession that lasts do not then abandon your confidence which carries with it great rewards for you need patience 19 is matt 7 14 is isa 40 10 62 11 ps 62 6i ia rom 2 6 rev 2 23 22 12 i prov 14 29 is the language of this as of the preceding chapter is drawn from ii cor 6 3 10 is heb 10 32 6 exhortation to martyrdom 425 let us also now endure a severe struggle of suffering being an object of public ridicule and affliction and accepting gladly the plunder of our property for we are convinced that we have a better possession not earthly nor even material but invisible and immaterial for we make our aim not the things that are seen seeing that they are transitory while the immaterial things are eternal 20 45 some do not consider the truth concerning daemons namely that if they are to remain in this gross air near the earth they need food from sacrifices and so keep where there is always smoke and blood and incense 21 accordingly they hold it a light and indifferent matter to offer sacrifice to this we would say that if those who provide food for thieves and murderers and barbarian enemies of the great king are punished as offenders against society how much more would they be most justly punished who by sacrificing to the ministers of evil give them food which maintains them in the region near the earth and particularly so if they have learnt that he who sacrifices to other gods except to the lord alone shall be destroyed 3 22 an j nevertheless sacrifice to those responsible for the evils upon earth indeed i think that because of the misdeeds committed by the daemons who work against mankind those who feed them with sacrifices are no less responsible than the daemons who commit wicked deeds for both the daemons and those who keep them on earth have injured men in like degree since without the smoke and sacrifices and the food thought to be suited to their bodies the daemons would not be able to subsist 46 some again think that names are given by an arbitrary convention and have no natural attachment to the things they describe 23 they think it is of no consequence if a man says i worship the supreme god whether his name is zeus or zen or if he says i honour and venerate the sun or apollo and the moon or artemis and the spirit in the earth or demeter 20 ii cor 4 18 21 for sacrifices as the food of daemons c my note on origen contra celsum ii 1 3 28 for the view that they cause earthly disasters such as famine drought flood and earthquake cf contra celswm viii 31 22 ex 22 20 19 23 the arguments of this chapter recur in contra celsum i 3 24 v 45 aristotle held that names were given by an arbitrary human determi nation the stoics held that names were given by nature the first utterances of the first men being imitations of the things described and so becoming their names probably the view combated by origen v advanced by gnostic sects who wished to provide a rational justificati of yielding to authority in time of persecution was ion 426 origen and whatever else the greek wise men say to them we must reply that the question of names is very profound and obscure he who understands it will see that if names were a matter of mere human convention those beings we call daemons or other powers unperceived by us would not obey those who while thinking of them in their minds use their names as if they had been given by an arbitrary convention but in fact certain sounds and syllables which are pronounced with or without aspiration with either long or short vowel sound control those who are invoked probably by some natural power imperceptible to us if this is so and names are not a matter of arbitrary convention the supreme god ought not to be invoked by any name except those used by moses and the prophets and our saviour and lord himself such as sabaoth adonai shaddai and again god of abraham god of isaac and god of jacob for this he says is an everlasting name and a memorial to generations of generations 3 24 it is not surprising if the daemons attribute their own names to the supreme god so that they may be worshipped as the supreme god but this is foreign to our moses and the prophets and to christ the law's fulfilment and to his apostles we have felt it necessary to say this lest anyone should trick us in argument or in even the least degree defile our reasoning these considerations must be carefully weighed if we are to give our opponents no opportunity for a subtle attack 47 furthermore a man may still love life even though he has attained a conviction that the essence of the rational soul has a certain kinship with god 25 for both are intellectual and invisible and as decisive reasoning proves incorporeal but why did our maker implant in us a longing for religious com munion with him so that even in the erring he preserves certain traces of the divine will 26 if it were not possible and attainable for the rational beings to apprehend that which they long for by nature and it is clear that just as each of our members has some ability for which it is naturally fitted the eyes to see visible things and the ears to hear sounds so the mind is for intelligible things and god who transcends them why then do we hesitate and doubt to put off the corruptible body that hinders us and weighs down the soul the earthly tabernacle that fills the ex 3 15

anxieties 2 and to be set free from our ties and to retire from the stormy waves that are the lot of flesh and blood for then we may enjoy with christ jesus the rest which accompanies blessedness and contemplate him in his wholeness the living word fed by him and comprehending the manifold wisdom in him and being stamped with the very truth we may have our minds enlightened by the true and unfailing light of knowledge and have the vision of those things which by that light can be seen by eyes illuminated by the commandment of the lord 2 8 48 long ago we heard jesus 3 words and it is now in the dis tant past that we were made disciples of the gospel and all built for ourselves a house where we have built whether we have dug deep and founded it on the rock or on the sand with out any foundation the present struggle will show for a storm is imminent bringing rain and rivers and winds or as luke says flood water 2 9 when these break upon the house either they will not be able to shake it and the house will not fall for the reason that it is built upon the rock on christ or they will show up the weakness of the building which will fall under the blows of the tempest may this never happen to our buildings a fall by apostasy is very great or as luke says great is the ruin of the building that lacks any foundation therefore let us pray that we may be like the wise man who built his house on the rock against such a house there may come the rain from the spiritual powers of evil in the heavens or the rivers from the world rulers of this darkness 30 or the flood water of the spirits beneath the earth let them break themselves on our building founded on the rock not only that the house may not fall but that it may not be shaken in the least and that it may be rather they than we who suffer from their onslaught let each one of us say as he strikes the hostile powers so i fight but not as a man beating the air 31 49 moreover since the sower went forth to sow let us show that our soul has received his seed not as those by the way side nor as those on rocky ground nor as the thorns but as the good soil because the word of jesus did not come by the way side or among thorns so much as in us lies let us make our boast in the lord for we have understood the message where fore the evil one has not snatched away the seed sown in our 27 wisdom of solomon 9 15 28

world nor the deceitfulness of riches nor the pleasures of this life have been able to hinder the word of god in our souls it remains for men to doubt whether god's word so far as we have received it has fallen in rocky ground or on good soil for tribulation and per secution have arisen on account of the word and there has come upon us a time of great temptation when he whose seed has been sown in rocky ground and those who have not dug deep and received jesus into the depths of their soul will be shown up but he who has understood the word bears fruit and holds the word to the end producing a hundredfold in patience 32 we hear how scripture speaks of those who stumble in time of tribulation or persecution after they have seemed to receive the holy teaching with joy they stumble because they have no root but believe only for a time according to matthew the text reads he who was sown on rocky ground this is he who hears the word and at once receives it joyfully but he has not root in himself and endures only for a time when tribulation or per secution arise because of the word immediately he stumbles 33 according to mark these are they who are sown on stony ground who when they hear the word at once receive it joy fully and they have no root in themselves but endure only for a time when tribulation and persecution arise because of the word immediately they stumble 34 according to luke but those on the rock are they who when they hear receive the word joyfully and these have no root who for a time believe and in time of temptation fall away 35 but concerning those who bring forth good fruit scripture teaches as follows he who is sown on the good soil this is he who hears the word and under stands it who bears fruit and produces it some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty 36 or and those are they who were sown upon the good soil who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold 37 or but that in the good soil these are they who in an honest and good heart hear the word and hold it fast and bring forth fruit with patience 38 since then according to the apostle you are god's planting god's building 39 planted in the good soil built on the rock as 32 see matt 13 3 ff mark 4 4 ff luke 8 5 ff 33 matt 13 20 21 34 mark 4 16 17 35 luke 8 13 36 matt 13 23 37 mark 4 20 38 luke 8 15 39 i cor 3 9 exhortation to

of the care of this world or the deceitfulness of evil or the pleasures of this life let us despise all these and take the spirit of wisdom which is free from anxiety 40 and hasten to obtain the wealth that has no deceitfulness and let us go to the pleasures so to speak of the paradise of luxury 41 in every distress let us reckon that our present light affliction which lasts but a moment results in an eternal weight of glory beyond all esti mation if we fix our eyes not on the things that are seen but on those that are unseen 42 50 let us also be aware that the word concerning abel who was killed by the wicked murderer gain applies to all whose blood is unjustly shed for the words the cry of thy brother's blood calls to me from the ground 43 we may consider to be applicable also to each of the martyrs the cry of their blood calls to god from the ground perhaps also just as we have been redeemed by the precious blood of jesus 44 jesus who has received the name that is above every name 45 so also some are redeemed by the precious blood of the martyrs and they themselves are exalted more than they would have been if they had been just men but had not been martyrs for it is with reason that a martyr's death is called exaltation as is clear from the saying if i be exalted from the earth i will draw all men to me 46 let us also therefore glorify god exalting him by our own death since by his death the martyr will glorify god we learn this from the words of john this he said signifying by what death he would glorify god 47 51 this exhortation which i have written for you is the best of which i am capable i pray it may be of assistance to you in the present conflict if expecially now when you are worthy to see more of the mysteries of god you can apprehend greater and richer truths more valuable for the present crisis so that you look down on my poor efforts as childish and simple i my self hope that this will be your experience what is important for you is that you should be helped not by me but from any source whatever god grant that you may be helped by words more divine and full of understanding surpassing all human nature and by the wisdom of god 40

some caves cleared of rubbish at tura south of cairo to make a store for ammunition this led the discovery of a small library of works written on papyrus by origen and didymus the blind the papyri appear to have been written late in the sixth century both origen and didymus were con demned as heretical at justinian's council of constantinople in 553 and it is very possible that the cache was made in conse quence of the resulting proscription of the works of origen the most important is the only one so far published the dialogue with heraclides the present translation is made from the splendid edition produced by the french papyrologist m jean scherer nothing was previously known of the existence of this work no work of origen is more obviously authentic the dialogue consists of the minutes of a discussion held at a synod of bishops summoned to discuss the opinions of a certain bishop heraclides whose orthodoxy has been called in question no indication is given of the place and date and it seems that some preliminary matter is missing at the beginning perhaps other parts of the discussion did not interest the sixth century copyist so much as the part in which origen played the leading role origen frequently took part in theological disputations he disputed with jewish rabbis on a number of occasions 1 euse bius of caesarea had before him the minutes of a discussion held some time between 238 and 244 with beryllus bishop of bostra in arabia whose monotheistic theology led him to deny the pre existence and independent kypostasis of the son origen i cf origen contra celsum i 45 with my note thereon 430 dialogue with heraclibes 431 won over beryllus to his own more pluralistic doctrine of god 2 eusebius also mentions another synod of no small dimensions in arabia to which origen was invited to debate with some who taught that the soul dies with the body at death and only comes to life with the body at the resurrection 3 similar questions are ventilated in the dialogue with heraclides but it would be risky to identify our dialogue with the debate of the arabian synod this arabian synod may with more probability be identified if at all with origen's discussion with the other heraclides and celer his predecessor mentioned in the dialogue with heraclides below p 444 origen says that at this earlier debate contro versy had become so acute that he had almost withdrawn altogether but his opponent had eventually come round to his view origen's fame brought him frequent invitations to go and explain to other churches the finer points of theology on one occasion it led to serious trouble about a.d 229 he was invited to greece to dispute with a certain valentinian named candi dus it was when he was on his way there that he was ordained presbyter at caesarea in palestine 4 candidus defended the valentinian doctrine that salvation and damnation are deter mined by nature not by will and to prove his point he observed that the devil was wholly wicked and could not be saved origen repliecuhat if the devil fell by his own free will it must at least be possible for him to choose right and to be saved 5 a garbled version of the debate was published by gandidus the imputa tion to origen of the doctrine that the devil will be saved caused no little consternation at alexandian where bishop demetrius was already vexed by his ordination at gaesarea he evidently wrote an angry letter to palestine the palestinian bishops hastily wrote to origen at athens telling him of the general consternation and asking for an authentic copy of the dispute with candidus formal censure was passed upon origen at alexandria though the bishops of palestine arabia phoenicia 2 eusebius h.e vi 33 the minutes were also known to jerome de vir inl 60 they also contained some discussion of the soul of christ but to what purpose is not clear socrates h e iii 7 6 3 eusebius h.k vi 37 eusebius vi 8 4 23 4 jerome de vir inl 54 pamphilus ap photius bibl 118 see above p 175 5 origen elsewhere expresses this view cf de princ iii 6 5 i 6 3 comm in ep ad titum v 290 lommatzsch rufinus has reshaped cotnm in ep ad rom viii 8 vii 247 lommatzsch to give explicit denial of the possibility 43 2 origen and achaea the scene of his recent visit significantly refused to agree to the sentence 6 we have substantial fragments of an im passioned letter written by origen to his friends at alexandria in which with crushing irony similar in tone to that used about demetrius at the beginning of the sixth book of the commentary on st john he observes that he would not revile the devil any more than the bishops who have condemned him 7 such un fortunate experiences explain the caution shown by origen in the conference with heraclides it is not impossible that the bishop demetrius mentioned in the dialogue with heraclides is none other than the bishop of alexandria if so the dialogue must be earlier than a.d 230 it is also possible that the beloved dionysius is the future bishop of alexandria but this is not really probable the maximus of the dialogue may be the successor of beryllus of bostra who took part in the origenist synod at antioch at 268 which con demned paul of samosata if so the dialogue must be placed later in origen's career and occurred at a synod in arabia the later date has received more support and seems to be more likely the dialogue with heraclides is concerned with three main sub jects the chief concern of the synod was the orthodoxy of bishop heraclides and the synod is evidently held in his church the bishops did not perhaps trust their own powers to deal with such advanced theological questions and called in origen 6 jerome ep 33 5 7 sources rufinus de adulterations librorum origenis p.g xvii 624 626 with the corrections of jerome apol adv rufin ii 18 19 photius bibl 1 1 8 summarizes the account of demetrius condemnation of origen given by pamphilus apology the tendency of pamphilus is to play down doctrinal issues and to make it appear that demetrius ground of com plaint was the irregularity of origen's ordination a as having been done in palestine without his consent b as being contrary to church law prohibiting the ordination of the mutilated the same tendency is clear in eusebius h.e vi 8 4 5 wno sa ys that demetrius was envious of origen's fame and so objected to the technical validity of his ordination jerome writing before he joined the anti origenist camp similarly says that the censure passed upon origen at rome was not on account of any doctrinal innovation not for any heresy as rabid dogs are now alleging against him but because they could not endure the magnificence of his eloquence and knowledge ep 33 5 the majority of modern writers have accepted the thesis of pamphilus and eusebius that demetrius con demnation was based not on a doctrinal issue but on mere matters of church discipline the evidence of rufinus and jerome's apology seems clearly to tell against it cf c g richardson the condemnation of origen in church history vi 1937 pp 50 64 dialogue with heraclides 433 to help them just as at antioch in a.d 268 the presbyter mal chion is asked to conduct the cross examination of paul of samosata so origen questions heraclides it is he who deter mines the form in which the questions are put so that heraclides finds himself arguing on origen's ground we cannot tell how he would have expressed his theology if he had been left to himself the laity are present in the church as also they were at antioch in 268 heraclides begins by assuring the synod that he too is ready to agree to the logos theology of the fourth gospel john 1 13 it seems that in the immediately preceding discussion not copied by the scribe this text has been quoted against him he follows this with a credal statement it is now time for origen to begin his cross examination which is designed to elicit from heraclides a confession of the pre existence and independent existence of the son the theology of the greek apologists is marked by a strong emphasis on the independent hypostasis of the son in relation to the father justin martyr had spoken of the son as another god from the last decade of the second century the logos theology of the apologists met with strong opposition from those who felt that it was incompatible with monotheism two courses were open to the critics either they could say that jesus was god without qualification the person of christ is the person of god if christ suffered then god suffered or they could say that jesus was a man like other men but indwelt by the spirit of god to a unique degree the former view was later known in the east as sabellianism in the west as patripassianism the latter view is usually called adoptianism by modern writers it has no ancient equivalent title origen's theology as set forth to heraclides is intended to steer a middle course between scylla and charybdis the one party he says abolishes the distinct personality of the son in relation to the father and thus vir tually does away with the father as well since if the son is not distinct the father cannot be father the other party denies the deity of christ only the doctrine that the logos is both separate from and one with the father avoids heresy it is clear that for origen the independence of the son is theologically prior to his oneness with the father he begins by thinking of two gods and then tries to explain how they are one never vice versa in other writings he does not shrink any more than in the dialogue with heraclides from affirming that there are two gods though as here he usually adds some qualifying a.c 28 434 origen phrase 8 he pursues heraclides with politely relentless question ing until he has to agree despite all his reluctance that there are two gods heraclides at once adds the power is one 9 and even origen deems it wise to take the edge off his sharply ditheistic statement so scandalous to the brethren the controversy in heraclides church seems to have centred on the prayers used at the eucharist origen appeals to the universal usage of the church to make offering to god through jesus christ this is no double offering to two gods but to god through god the theology of prayer here implied is set forth at greater length in origen's treatise on prayer 10 here he insists that the church of heraclides must show its unity with all other churches by adhering to the customary agreed formulas of prayer if it fails to do so it will give rise to fresh disputes 11 in the second section of the dialogue origen turns to deal with an objection raised it appears at some earlier stage of the conference by maximus concerning the christological implica tions of the logos doctrine if jesus christ is god in his very essence ouo ttoscds what is to be said of the reality of his body and in particular of his death could the body of god become a corpse 12 origen states his beliefs if the body of christ did not truly die and rise again it cuts at the root of the church's faith in the resurrection of believers 13 maximus is asked if he is satisfied the text is again corrupt but this seems to be required by the context maximus reply shows a fear significant for the atmosphere of the synod lest the fact of his raising a question may impugn his reputation for orthodoxy his question is only a gf origen de orations xv i contra celsum v 39 vi 61 vii 57 comm in ev jo ii 2 x 37 21 9 the language is reminiscent of hippolytus who uses the same phrase to qualify

addressed to christ not the father 11 this is the general sense of a passage which is badly corrupted and was unintelligible to the original scribe 12 the connection of thought at this point in the dialogue is not immediately obvious the view expressed above seems to be the simplest interpretation 13 similar insistence on the reality of christ's material body as necessary for human salvation in origen's commentary on galatians cited in pamphilus apology xxiv 365 ff lommatzsch dialogue with heraclides 435 a request for information i need the help of my brother and instruction on this point 53 the difficulty about origen's view as he sees it is this jesus said father into thy hands i com mend my spirit the divine nature returned to the father what power then was it which opened the tomb and raised up the flesh origen replies by appealing to the pauline trichotomy of i thess 5 23 may god sanctify your spirit and your soul and your body the spirit jesus committed to the father was not the holy spirit but his human spirit for the logos took to himself the entire constitution of man body soul and spirit the whole man would not have been saved unless he had taken upon him the whole man a sentence which anticipates the standard anti apollinarian argument of the fourth century thus christ's human body soul and spirit were separated at the passion the spirit was temporarily entrusted to the father the soul descended to hades the body remained in the tomb they were reunited shortly after the resurrection though not at the actual moment of the resurrection as is proved by the words to mary magdalene john 20 17 touch me not for i am not yet ascended to the father he did not wish her to touch him before he had reclaimed the spirit left in temporary deposit with the father he appeared to his disciples after all three elements of his humanity had been reunited origen has now said his say on all the questions of doctrine which had been the immediate subject of controversy in heraclides church after a homily on the equal importance of orthodoxy and right conduct he invites questions on any other points of theology the question is put by dionysius is the soul the blood from the text in lev 17 11 the soul of all flesh is blood supported by deut 12 23 some were evidently drawing the conclusion that the soul was material and was corrupted with the body in the grave 14 with such explicit texts of scripture to explain away origen finds himself extremely embarrassed he is most reluctant to speak especially with uninstructed laymen present lest he should be casting his pearls before swine his lengthy reply so long that some of his audience cease to pay attention in their impatience is that scripture often uses 14 similar beliefs were refuted by origen at the arabian synod mentioned by eusebius h.e vi 37 though we are not told that the leviticus text played any part in the discussion there for a comparable discussion cf tertullian de anima 53 436 origen physical terms to describe spiritual realities therefore blood in the leviticus text cannot possibly mean blood a certain bishop philip has been absent and so has missed origen's discourse as he enters the synod bishop demetrius summarizes the debate for him brother origen teaches that the soul is immortal 35 the implication which is not lost on origen is that he is suspected of being more a platonist than a truly biblical theologian in his doctrine of the soul he answers that his appeal is not to the greeks but to the scripture it is however difficult to see that his involved discussion of the various meanings of death is of any value in answering the point the argument here shows him at his weakest content merely to assert and to conceal his embarrassment with verbiage origen ends with a

said what he thought and asked questions heraclides said i also believe what the sacred scriptures say in the begin ning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god he was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him nothing was made 3 2 accord ingly we hold the same faith that is taught in these words and we believe that christ took flesh that he was born that he went up to heaven in the flesh in which he rose again that he is sitting at the right hand of the father and that thence he shall come and judge the living and the dead being god and man origen said since once an inquiry has begun it is proper to say something upon the subject of the inquiry i will speak the whole church is present and listening it is not right that there should be any difference in knowledge between one church and another for you are not the false church i charge you father heraclides god is the almighty the uncreated the supreme god who made all things do you

created all things he was distinct from him orig is it true then that there was a god the son of god the only begotten of god the firstborn of all creation 4 and that we need have no fear of saying that in one sense there are two gods while in another there is one god heracl what you say is evident but we affirm that god is the almighty god without beginning without end containing all things and not contained by anything 5 and that his word is the son of the living god god and man through whom all things were made 6 god according to the spirit man inasmuch as he was born of mary 7 orig you do not appear to have answered my question explain what you mean for perhaps i failed to follow you is the father god heracl assuredly orig is the son distinct from the father heracl of course how can he be son if he is also father 124 orig while being distinct from the father is the son him self also god heracl he himself is also god orig and do two gods become a unity heracl yes orig do we confess two gods heracl yes the power is one orig but as our brethren take offence at the statement that there are two gods we must formulate the doctrine carefully and show in what sense they are two and in what sense the two are one god also the holy scriptures have taught that several things which are two are one and not only things which are two for they have also taught that in some instances more than two or even a very much larger number of things are one our 4 col 1 15 5 a theological commonplace cf origen de pnnc i 3 3 etc 6 john 1 3 7 of rom 1 3 dialogue with heraglides 439 present task is not to broach a problematic subject only to pass it by and deal cursorily with the matter but for the sake of the simple folk to chew up so to speak the meat and little by little to instil the doctrine in the ears of our hearers accordingly there are many things which are two that are said in the scrip tures to be one what passages of scripture adam is one per son his wife another adam is distinct from his wife and his wife is distinct from her husband yet it is said in the story of the creation of the world that they two are one for the two shall be one flesh 8 therefore sometimes two beings can become one flesh notice however that in the case of adam and eve 126 it is not said that the two shall become one spirit nor that the two shall become one soul but that they shall become one flesh again the righteous man is distinct from christ but he is said by the apostle to be one with christ for he that is joined to the lord is one spirit 9 is it not true that the one is of a sub ordinate nature or of a low and inferior nature while christ's nature is divine and glorious and blessed are they therefore no longer two yes for the man and the woman are no longer two but one flesh and the righteous man and christ are one spirit so in relation to the father and god of the universe our saviour and lord is not one flesh nor one spirit but some thing higher than flesh and spirit namely one god the appropriate word when human beings are joined to one another is flesh the appropriate word when a righteous man is joined to christ is spirit but the word when christ is united to the father is not flesh nor spirit but more honourable than these god that is why we understand in this sense i and the father are one 10 when we pray because of the one party let us preserve the duality because of the other party let us hold to the unity in this way we avoid falling into the opinion of those who have been separated from the church and turned to the illusory notion of monarchy who abolish the son as distinct from the father and virtually abolish the father also nor do 128 we fall into the other blasphemous doctrine which denies the deity of christ what then do the divine scriptures mean when they say beside me there is no other god and there shall be none after me and i am and there is no god but me 11 in these utterances we are not to think that the unity applies to the god of the universe in separation from christ and s gen 2 24 matt 19 5 9 i cor 6 17 cf contra celsum ii 9 vi 47 cowm inmatt xiv 16 10 john 10 30 i 1 isa 43 10 deut 32 39 44 origen certainly not to christ in separation from god let us rather say that the sense is the same as that of jesus saying i and my father are one it is necessary to study these doctrines because there has been much disturbance in this church often people write and de mand a signature of the bishop and of those they suspect asking that they should give their signatures in the presence of all the people that there may be no further disturbance or dispute about this question accordingly with the permission of god and secondly of the bishops thirdly of the presbyters and also of the people i will again say what i think on this subject 130 offering is universally made to almighty god through jesus christ inasmuch as in respect of his deity he is akin to the father let there be no double offering but an offering to god through god i shall seem to be speaking in a daring manner when we pray let us abide by the agreements 12 if the word thou shalt not respect the person of man nor allow thyself to be impressed by the person of the mighty 13 is not realized if this is not realized these agreements it will give rise to fresh disputes if a man is a bishop or a presbyter he is not a bishop he is not a presbyter if he is a deacon he is not a deacon nor even a layman if he is a layman he is not a lay man nor is there a meeting of the congregation if you assent let these agreed usages prevail 132 some people raise the objection that with reference to the problem of deity while i have thus attributed deity to jesus christ substantially i have professed before the church my faith that at the resurrection the body which rose had been a corpse 14 but since our saviour and lord took a body let us 12 origen uses sunthekai of the promises and credal confession made in baptism e.g exl mart 12 17 cf clem strom vii 90 the terms of the baptismal confession would perhaps be a possible translation here but the general idea of this corrupt passage is an appeal to the universal sense of the church it is likely that origen means the agreed formulas of liturgical prayer lex orandi lex credendi scherer however thinks it means the agreements which are to constitute the practical conclusion of the debate 13 lev 19 15 the quotation is odd scherer is probably right in taking this to refer to interference in the affairs of the church by powerful people without authority but the precise sense of the allusion is lost and the passage the text of which is more corrupt than any other in the dialogue was not understood by the original scribe the general sense is that if unauthorized people interfere there will be chaos and the authorized ministry deprived of all meaning 14 see the introduction above p 434 dialogue with heraglides 441 examine what the body was the church alone in distinction from all the heresies that deny the resurrection confesses the resurrection of the dead body for from the fact that the first fruits were raised from the dead it follows that the dead are raised christ the firstfruits 15 on that account his body be came a corpse for if his body had not become a corpse capable of being wrapped in a grave cloth of receiving the ointment and all the other things applied to dead bodies and of being laid in a tomb 16 these are things that cannot be done to a spiritual body for it is entirely impossible for that which is spiritual to become a corpse neither can that which is spiritual become insensible for if it were possible for that which is 134 spiritual to become a corpse we would have reason to fear lest after the resurrection of the dead when our body is raised according to the apostle's saying it is sown animate it is raised spiritual 3 17 we shall all die in fact christ being raised from the dead dies no more 18 and not only christ but those who are christ's 19 when they are raised from the dead die no more if you agree to these statements they also with the solemn testimony of the people shall be made legally binding and established 20 what else is there to be said concerning the faith do you agree to this maximus say maximus may everyone hold the same doctrines as i do before god and the church i both give my signature and make my oath but the reason why i raised a certain question was in order that i might be in no doubt or uncertainty at all for the brethren know that this is what i said i need the help of my brother and instruction on this point if the spirit was truly 136 given back to the father in accordance with the saying father into thy hands i commend my spirit 21 and if without the spirit the flesh died and lay in the tomb how was the tomb opened and how are the dead to rise again orig that man is a composite being we have learnt from the sacred scriptures for the apostle says may god sanctify your spirit and your soul and your body and may he sanctify you wholly and may your entire spirit and soul and body be is i cor 15 12 ff i gf matt 27 59 mark 15 46 luke 23 53 n i cor 15 44 18 rom 6 9 i cor 15 23 20 the procedure appears to have been that at the end of the synod the doc trinal decisions would have been formally set forth and the congregation would have declared their adherence thereto 21 luke 23 46 442 origen preserved unblameable at the coming of our lord jesus christ 22 this spirit is not the holy spirit but part of the constitution of man as the same apostle teaches when he says the spirit bears witness with our spirit 23 for if it were the holy spirit he would not have said the spirit bears witness with our spirit so then our saviour and lord wishing to save man in the way in which he wished to save him for this reason desired in this way to save the body just as it was likewise his will to save also the soul he also wished to save the remaining part of man the spirit the whole man would not have been saved un less he had taken upon him the whole man they do away with the salvation of the human body when they say that the body of the saviour is spiritual they do away with the salvation of the human spirit concerning which the apostle says no man knows the things of man except the spirit of man that is in 138 him 24 because it was his will to save the spirit of man about which the apostle said this he also assumed the spirit of man at the time of the passion these three were separated at the time of the resurrection these three were united at the time of the passion they were separated how the body in the tomb the soul in hades the spirit was put in the hands of the father 25 the soul in hades thou shalt not leave my soul in hades 26 if the spirit was put into the hands of the father he gave the spirit as a deposit it is one thing to make a gift another thing to hand over and another to leave in deposit he who makes a deposit does so with the intention of receiving back that which he has deposited why then had he to give the spirit to the father as a deposit the question is beyond me and my powers and my understanding for i am not endowed with knowledge to enable me to say that just as the body was not able to go down to hades even if this is alleged by those who affirm that the body of jesus was spiritual 27 so also neither could the spirit go down 22 i thess 5 23 cf origen de princ ii 8 4 where he suggests that christ's soul was a kind of medium between the weak flesh and the willing spirit 23 rom 8 16 24 i cor 2 11 25 j crehan

descended to hades to save all who had resisted the god of the jews such as the sodomites cf contra celsum vi 53 with my note thereon dialogue with heraglides 443 to hades and therefore he gave the spirit to the father as a deposit until he should have risen from the dead after he had entrusted this deposit to the father he took it back again when not at the actual moment of the resurrection but im mediately after the resurrection my witness is the text of the gospel the lord jesus christ rose again from the dead mary met him and he said to her touch me not 28 for he wished anyone that touched him to touch him in his entirety that having touched him in his entirety he might be benefited in body from his body in soul from his soul in spirit from his 140 spirit for i am not yet ascended to the father he ascends to the father and comes to the disciples accordingly he ascends to the father why to receive back the deposit all the questions about the faith which disturbed us have been examined but we must realize that at the divine tribunal we are not judged for faith alone 29 as if our life were left un examined nor for our life alone as if our faith were not subject to scrutiny we are justified on the ground that both are cor rect we are punished for both if both are incorrect there are some however who will not be punished for both but for one of the two some for their faith because it is defective but not because their life is lacking in right conduct others again will not be punished for their faith but will be for their life on the ground that they have lived a life contrary to right reason my opinion is that in the proverbs of solomon these two kinds i mean that which concerns our belief and knowledge and that which concerns our manner of life are mentioned by solomon in the following words who shall boast that he has a pure heart or who shall present himself saying that he is free from sins 30 the difference between these we take to be this the heart means the thought the sins refer to actions who shall boast that he has a pure heart which is undefiled by the knowledge falsely so called 31 undefiled by falsehood or who shall present himself saying that he is free from sins having done nothing amiss in his practical conduct if then we wish to be saved let us not be concerned about faith to the neglect of 142 practical conduct of life nor again let us place our confidence in our life let us realize let us comprehend let us believe that it is on the ground of both that we either receive our acquittal or blessedness or receive the opposite of these the things that are liable to punishment therefore are not merely the terrible 28 john 20 1 7 29 cf james 2 24 so prov 20 9 31 i tim 6 20 444 origen and fearful sins which should not even be named 32 whether sins of life or of thought but also sins commonly thought to be of less importance that is why it seems the apostle puts side by side with acts which are abominable infamous and revolting if i may so say things which are regarded by most people as of little significance what does he say be not deceived neither fornicators nor adulterers nor effeminate men nor homo sexuals nor thieves nor drunkards nor revilers shall inherit the kingdom of god 33 you see that together with such gross sinners as the homosexual person the effeminate man the adulterer the fornicator he enumerates the drunkard the reviler sins thought by all of us to be of small account so that we may be taught that it is not for the great sins alone that we are excluded from the kingdom of god but also for these which are commonly supposed to be of minor significance therefore let us not revile nor be drunkards nor extort nor steal nor do anything wrong even if we are deceived 34 144 if there is any further point to raise concerning the rule of faith mention it we will speak still further upon the scripture dionysius said is the soul the blood orig it has come to my notice and i say this with full know ledge of the facts that some of the folk here and in the neigh bourhood suppose that after the soul has departed this life it is incapable of feeling but is in the tomb in the body and i know that on this question i was impelled to deal very severely with the other heraclides and celer his predecessor so severely in fact that i would have preferred to leave the subject and to go away 35 but for the sake of honour and for the subject under debate he summoned us to deal with it we agreed to discuss 5 3 33 i cor 6 9 10 of origen in i cor xxvi jenkins j.t.s ix 1908 367 most of us can know in our consciences that we are not guilty of these vices but with regard to those that follow even i myself fear lest i may be guilty of the other sins 34 this strange phrase is explained by horn in jerem xx 3 where qrigen says that i cor 6 9 10 might cause those who do not understand that god's punishments are purifying to lose heart for which of us is not aware in his conscience of having drunk not wisely and too well which of us is pure from theft the truth that minor sins are punished by god no less than serious vices is a mystery which providentially is not understood by the ignorant multitude of believers who if they were not deceived would abandon hope not realizing that god's punishments and harsh words are remedial and not retributive 35 cf introduction above p 431 dialogue with heraclides 445 the matter he made a statement 36 how the former cleared himself before us as though before god by his orthodox 37 statements accordingly the question posed by the beloved dionysius forces our hand i shall first set out the passages which trouble them lest any one of them be omitted and by god's permission we will answer each one of them in accordance with your re quest the disturbing passage is as follows the soul of all flesh is blood this text has terribly distressed those who have 146 not understood it also ye shall not eat the soul with the flesh pay strict heed to see that you eat no blood ye shall not eat the soul with the flesh 38 the disturbing text is this one for the other distressing texts are far less emphatic in expressing the idea suggested here for my part according to my measure of understanding and praying for assistance in reading the divine words for we are in need of help lest our minds should conceive ideas diverging from the truth 39 i have found that incorporeal things are given the same names as all the cor poreal things so that just as corporeal things apply to the outer man those which are given the same names as corporeal things apply to the inner man the bible says that man is two men for if our outward man perish yet our inward man is renewed day by day and i rejoice in the law of god after the inward man 40 these two men the apostle everywhere shows to be distinct in my judgment he would not have ventured to invent this notion out of his own head but rather said this because he had clearly understood statements in the scriptures which are obscurely expressed some people imagine that there is a mere repetition when in the story of the creation of the world after the creation of man we read god took dust of the earth and formed man 41 the corollary of this interpretation is that it is the body which is the part after the image 42 and that god is given a human form or that the form of god 43 is shaped like the human body but we are not so crazy as to say either that 36 the sense is not clear and was not understood by the scribe whether heraclides or celer cleared himself before origen is obscure 37 reading f a vals morccos op fc ms orc co trpos 1 feov 38 lev 17 11 f deut 12 23 30 origen often says that divine grace and prayer are necessary for inter preting the scripture rightly cf e.g horn in ezech ii 2 40 ii cor 4 16 rom 7 22 for the idea cf contra celsum vii 34 de princ i 1 9 the names of organs of sense are often applied to the soul very similar is horn in ezech ill 8 41 gen 2 7 42 gen 1 26 43 cf phil 2 6 446 origen 148 god is composed of a superior and an inferior element so that that which is in his image is like him in both elements which consitute god in his completeness or that that which is in his image consisted rather in the inferior part and not in the superior 44 the questions are highly delicate we need hearers who have an acute understanding i therefore charge those who listen to pay heed to themselves lest they should make me liable to the accusation of casting holy things to the dogs to shameless souls for the barkers like dogs those who think only of fornication and abuse do nothing but yelp like dogs and it is not right for me to cast holy things before such folk so also i charge my hearers that they do not make me liable to the accusation of 150 laying splendid pearls which we try to collect like good mer chants 45 before people steeped in the impurities of their bodies and who are therefore called swine 46 for i would say that a person who continually steeps himself and wallows in the filth of life and makes no attempt to live a pure life a holy life is simply a swine if then because the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls i find the goodly pearls and having bought them at the price of weariness and sleeplessness i fling them before pleasure loving souls and those who are steeped in the filth of the body and in impurity then i also will be a transgressor because i am casting pearls before swine but when the swine have got the pearls because they do not perceive their beauty nor see their excellence they tread them under foot by speaking evil of what was rightly said and not only do they trample the pearls under foot but they also turn and rend those who supplied them with the pearls i beseech you therefore be transformed resolve to learn that in you there is the capacity to be transformed and to put off the form of a swine which is in an impure soul and the shape of a dog which is that of a man who barks and reviles and pours out abuse it is also possible to be transformed from the shape of snakes for a wicked man is described as a serpent and 44 the text here is corrupt the later reviser makes corrections rejected by scherer but which seem more satisfactory than his own close adherence to the original scribe i have attempted to translate the reviser's text the idea is closely paralleled in contra celsum vi 63 4 5 read after friichtel im dw lte0a a kaxol l ropot traparibevrcs but friichtel needlessly inserts a verb origen normally constructs with a following participle as here and p 152 18 sch k matt 7 6 dialogue with heraglides 447 the offspring of vipers 3 47 if then we are willing to under stand that in us there is the power to be transformed from being serpents swine and dogs let us learn from the apostle that the transformation depends upon us for he says this we all when with unveiled face we reflect the glory of the lord are transformed into the same image 48 if you are like a barking dog and if the word has moulded and transformed you you have been transformed from being a dog to being a man if you were impure and the word came to your soul and you sub mitted yourself to the moulding of the word you changed from being a swine to being a man if you were a savage beast and 152 heard the word that tames and softens that changes you into a man by the will of the word you will no longer be called a ser pent the offspring of vipers for if it were impossible for these serpents serpents in their soul because of wickedness to be changed the saviour or john would not have said do therefore fruits worthy of repentance 3 49 after repentance you are no longer a serpent the offspring of vipers since it is our task to speak about man and to inquire whether the soul of man is not blood and since this subject re quired us to discuss in detail the doctrine of the two men and as we have come to a mysterious subject i beseech you that you do not cause me to be accused of casting pearls before swine of throwing holy things to the dogs of flinging divine things to serpents of giving the serpent a share in the tree of life that i may avoid this accusation be transformed put off evil quar relling wrath strife anger division of opinion 50 that there may not be any further schisms among you but that you may be firmly established in the same mind and the same judgment 3351 to speak makes me embarrassed and not to speak makes me embarrassed because of those who are worthy i would speak lest i be accused of depriving of the word those able to under stand it because of the unworthy i shrink from speaking for the reasons i have given lest i should be flinging holy things to dogs and casting pearls before swine it was the work of jesus only to know how to distinguish among his hearers between those without and those within so that he spoke to those with out in parables but explained the parables to those who 47 cf matt 23 33 for the idea cf clement protrept i 4 48 ii cor 3 18 49 luke 3 8 cf matt 3 8 so cf col 3 8 si i cor 1 10 448 origen entered into his house 52 to remain without and to enter into the house have a mystical meaning why should i judge those 154 that are without 5 53 every sinner is without that is why those without are addressed in parables in case they should be able to leave the things without and enter within to enter the house has a mystical meaning he who enters jesus house is his true disciple he enters by holding the doctrine of the church by living a life according to the teaching of the church within and without are spiritual terms you see how long an introduction i have given in order to prepare my hearers i shrink from speaking when i am on the point of speaking i put it off what is my purpose in doing this to shape my discourse so as to heal the souls of my hearers at the creation of man then there was first created the man that is after the image 3 in whom there was nothing material he who is in the image is not made out of matter and god said let us make man in our image and likeness and let them have dominion 54 and so on and when god made man he did not take dust of the earth as he did the second time but he made him in the image of god that that which is in the image of god is understood as immaterial and superior to all cor poreal existence not only by moses but also by the apostle is shown by his words as follows putting off the old man with his deeds and putting on the new which is renewed in the know ledge of him who created him 55 therefore in each one of us there are two men why does scripture say that the soul of all flesh is blood it is a great problem just as the outward man has the same name as the inward man so also this is true of his members so that one may say that every member of the outward man has a name corres ponding to what is true of the inward man 156 the outward man has eyes and the inward man also is said to have eyes lighten my eyes lest i sleep in death 56 this does not refer to these eyes nor to physical sleep nor to ordinary death the commandment of the lord luminous enlightens the eyes 57 by keeping the commandments of the lord we do not become more sharp sighted physically but by 52 cf mark 4 11 matt 13 36 similarly contra celsum iii 21 53 i cor 5 12 54 gen 1

of our inward man see with greater per ception open my eyes and i shall comprehend the wonders of thy law 58 it is not that his eyes were veiled but our eyes are our mind it is for jesus alone to unveil them that we may be able to understand the scriptures and comprehend what is obscurely expressed the outward man has ears and the inward man also is said to have ears he that has ears to hear let him hear 59 they all had ears as organs of physical sense but they had not all succeeded in having the inward ears which are purified to possess the latter sort of ears is not part of our natural con stitution the former are part of our nature and because the former sort of ears are part of our nature the prophet says hear ye deaf and ye blind look and see who is deaf but my servants and who is blind but those who are their lords even the servants of god are blinded 60 that to become deaf is what we bring upon ourselves let us pay attention what i am saying will affect all of us it is necessary to describe the inward man to discover what the blood is that to become deaf in respect of the inward ears is something we bring upon our selves hear the declaration of the prophet sinners are alien ated from the womb they have erred from the womb they have spoken lies wrath is upon them after the likeness of the 158 serpent like a deaf adder which stops her ears which does not hear the voice of those who enchant her and the incantation pronounced by a wise man 61 and all of you also who are aware that you are responsible if you hear the word and the incajita tion pronounced by a wise man and listen to the enchanting words so that he may check your wrath and iniquity and if then you shut your ears and do not throw them wide open to accept what is said then to you apply the words wrath is on them after the likeness of the serpent like a deaf adder which stops her ears which does not hear the voice of those who enchant her and the incantation pronounced by a wise man the outward man has nostrils with which to smell and so perceives good and bad smells and the inner man with different nostrils perceives the good smell of righteousness and the bad smell of sins of the good smell the apostle teaches us when he says we are a sweet savour of christ unto god in every place 38 p s 119 n8 i8 matt 11 15 etc w isa 42 18 6i ps 58 57 3 5 cf contra celsum iv 72 and note

songs put ting the words into the mouth of the daughters of jerusalem after thee we will run to the odour of thy perfumes 63 as then we perceive with our nostrils good and bad smells in the world of sense so also for the inward man there is a perception of the good smell of righteousness such as the apostle had and an evil smell of sins which is possessed by the person whose divine senses are in good health what is the evil smell of sins that of which the prophet says this my sores have become foul and rotten in face of my foolishness 64 the outward man has the sense of taste and the inner man also has a spiritual taste of which it is said taste and see that the lord is kindly 65 160 the outward man has physical touch the inner man also has touch that touch by which the woman with the issue of blood touched the hem of jesus garment 66 she touched it for he witnessed to the fact saying who touched me yet just before peter said to him the crowds throng you and you say who touched me he imagined that those who touched him touched by physical not spiritual contact those therefore who thronged jesus did not touch him for they did not touch him by faith only the woman who had a sort of divine touch touched jesus and by this was healed and because she touched him with a divine touch power went out from jesus at her divine touch he says therefore who touched me for i have felt power to go forth from me concerning this more divine touch john says and our hands have handled concerning the word of life 6 in this way we possess other hands concerning which it is said let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice 68 for it is not when i lift up these hands while the hands of my soul hang down instead of being lifted up by holy and good works that the lifting up of my hands becomes an evening sacrifice i also have feet of a different kind concerning which solomon commands me saying let not thy foot stumble 69 there is a curious saying in ecclesiastes to anyone

body it is that which belongs to the inner man it is that blood which is poured forth from a sinful soul for the blood of your souls shall be required 35 80 it does not say your blood 51 but the blood of your souls and i will require the blood at the hand of the watchman 81 what kind of blood does god require at the hand of the watchman but that which is poured forth from the sinner thus the heart of the fool perishes and it is said hear me ye who have lost your heart because there is poured forth the blood and the vital power of the soul if one comprehends what the soul is and that it belongs to the inner man and that it is in that part there is the element which is in the image it is clear that paul was right when he said for it were better to depart and to be with christ 82 before the resurrection the righteous man is with christ and in his soul he lives with christ that is why it is better to depart and to be with christ but according to you who say that the soul remains in the tomb with the body it has not left the body it does not rest it does not dwell in the paradise of god it does not repose in the bosom of abraham 83 according to you who 166 maintain such absurd doctrines it would not be better to depart and to be with christ for one is not with christ as soon as one departs if the soul is the blood if the soul remains in the tombs how can it be with christ but according to my view and that of the word of god the soul which has departed from the troubles the sweat and the body that which can say lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace 84 is that which departs in peace and rests with christ it is thus that the soul of abraham understood the words as for thee thou shalt go in peace to thy fathers having lived to a good old age 85 he de parted to his fathers what fathers those of whom paul says for this cause i bow my knees to the father of whom all fatherhood is derived 86 in our view it was in this sense that aaron was set free 87 also it is written in ecclesiastes concerning the just man who has fought a good fight who is departing from the fetter of the body that from the house of the prisoners he will go forth to be a king 88 thus i am persuaded to die for the 8 gen 9 5 8i ezek 33 6 82 phil 1 23 s luke 16 23 84 luke 2 29 85 gen 15 15 cf exh mart 14 above p 403 86 eph 3 14 87 num 20 29 88 eccles 4 14 dialogue with heraglides 453 truth thus i readily despise what is called death bring wild beasts bring crosses bring fire bring tortures i know that as soon as i die i come forth from the body i rest with christ therefore let us struggle therefore let us wrestle let us groan being in the body 89 not as if we shall again be in the tombs in the body because we shall be set free from it and shall change our body to one which is more spiritual destined as we are to be with christ how we groan while we are in the body bishop philip came in and demetrius another bishop said brother origen teaches that the soul is immortal orig the remark of father demetrius has given us the start ing point for another problem he asserted that we have said the soul is immortal to this remark i will say that the soul is 168 immortal and the soul is not immortal let us first define the meaning of the word death and determine all its possible senses i will try to show all its meanings not by appealing to the greeks but all its meanings as found in the divine scripture perhaps one more learned than i will point out other senses also but for the present i am aware ofjhree kinds of death what are these three kinds of death according to the apostle a man may jive unto god and die unto sia this death k a blessed thing a man dies to sin this death my lord died for in that he died he died unto sin 91 1 know also another sort of death according to which a man dies to god concerning this it w s said the soul that sins it shall die 92 and i know of a third kind of death according to which we commonly suppose that those who are separated from the body die for adam lived nine hundred and thirty years and died 93 there being then three kinds of death let us see whether the human soul is immortal in respect of the three kinds of death or if not in respect of the three yet in respect of some of them the death that is a matter of moral indifference all men die 170 it is that which we consider dissolution no soul of man dies this death for if it did so it would not be punished after death it is said men shall seek for death and shall not find it 94 in this sense every human soul is immortal but in the other mean ings the soul in one sense is mortal and blessed if it dies to sin it is of this death that balaam spoke when he prophesied pray ing by divine inspiration may my soul die among the souls of 89 ii cor 5 2 4 90 rom 6 2 9i rom 6 10 92 ezek 18 4 93 gen 5 5 94 rev 9 6 454 origen the just 95 concerning this death balaam made his astonishing prophecy and by the word of god he made for himself a splendid prayer for he prayed that he might die to sin that he might live unto god and this account he said may my soul die among the souls of the just and my posterity be like their posterity there is another death in respect of which we are not immortal although we have the power by exercising vigil ance to avoid death and perhaps that which is mortal in the soul is not for ever mortal for in so far as it gives way to sin so that the word is realized which says the soul that sins it shall die 9 the soul is mortal and dies a real death but if it is found firmly established in blessedness so that it is inaccessible to death because it has eternal life it is no longer mortal but in 172 this sense has even become immortal how is it that the apostle says of god he who alone has immortality 35 9 7 on investigation i find that christ jesus died for all apart from god 98 there you have the explanation how god alone has immortality let us therefore take up eternal life let us take up that which depends upon our decision god does not give it to us he sets it before us behold i have set life before thy face 99 it is in our power to stretch out our hand to do good works and to lay hold on life and deposit it in our soul this life is the christ who said i am the life 1 this life is that which now is present in shadow but then will be face to face 2 for the spirit before our face is christ of whom we may say in his shadow we shall live among the nations 3 if the mere shadow of life that is yours offers you so many good things that shadow which moses had when he prophesied that shadow which isaiah possessed when he saw the lord sabaoth sitting upon a throne high and lifted up which jeremiah had when he heard the words before i formed thee in the womb i knew thee and before thou didst come forth from the womb i sanctified thee which ezekiel 95 num 23 10 scherer is no doubt right in explaining the repetition here as originating from a double recension the second fuller version was in tended to replace the first it is probable that the two versions arose from two different stenographic reports and that if origen revised the final copy himself he failed to notice the mistake 96 ezek 18 4 97 1 tim 6 16 98 ii cor 5 15 heb 2 9 which origen knows in both readings a apart from god b by the grace of god comm in joann i 35 40 xxviii 1 8 14 he regarded the first as the correct text 99 deut 30 15 i john 11 25 14 6 2 i cor 13 12 3 lam 4 20 dialogue with heraglides 455 had when he saw the cherubim when he saw the wheels the 174 ineffable mysteries 4 what sort of life shall we live when we are no longer living under the shadow of life but are in life itself for now our life is hid with christ but when christ who is our life shall appear then shall we also appear with him in glory 5 5 let us haste towards this life groaning and grieving that we are in this tent that we dwell in the body so long as we are present in the body we are absent from the lord 6 let us long to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord that being present with him we may become one with the god of the universe and his only begotten son being saved in all things and becoming blessed in jesus christ to whom be the glory and the power for ever and ever amen dialogues 1 of origen with heraclides and the bishops with him concerning the father and the son and the soul 4 isa 6 1 jer 1 5 ezek 1 15 10 1 5 col 3 3 4 6 ii cor 5 6 8 7 the plural offers no reason for supposing that there was a collection of origen's discussions only one of which has been preserved in the present text the reviser used the singular in the heading he gave to the work and evidently thought that a more appropriate designation but the original scribe may have used the plural to refer to the various themes

5022 printed tn the united states of america general editors preface the christian church possesses in its literature an abundant and incomparable treasure but it is an inheritance that must be reclaimed by each generation the library of christian classics is designed to present in the english language and in twenty six volumes of convenient size a selection of the most indispensable christian treatises written prior to the end of the sixteenth century the practice of giving circulation to writings selected for superior worth or special interest was adopted at the beginning of christian history the canonical scriptures were themselves a selection from a much wider literature in the patristic era there began to appear a class of works of compilation often designed for ready reference in controversy of the opinions of well reputed predecessors and in the middle ages many such works were produced these medieval anthologies actually preserve some noteworthy materials from works otherwise lost in modern times with the increasing inability even of those trained in universities and theological colleges to read latin and greek texts with ease and familiarity the translation of selected portions of earlier christian literature into modern languages has become more necessary than ever while the wide range of distinguished books wntten in vernaculars such as english makes selection there also needful the efforts that have been made to meet this need are too numerous to be noted here but none of these collections serves the purpose of the reader who desires a library of representative treatises spanning the christian centuries as a whole most of them embrace only the age of the church fathers and some of them have long been out of print a fresh translation of a work already 9 10 general editors preface translated may shed much new light upon its meaning this is true even of bible translations despite the work of many experts through the

published in the years between 410 and 420 when augustine was in his late fifties or early sixties still at the height of his powers and not yet wholly absorbed by the pelagian controversy which forced him to imprison his doc trine of grace in a system of rigid logic the augusdnianism whose authority has weighed so heavily and so unhappily upon christian thought though it has never been accepted by the consensus fidehum the title augustine later works might more properly be applied to the writings in which this system was worked out after the condemnation of pelagianism in 418 it has been chosen as the simplest general description of a group of works nearly contemporaneous with one another and separated by an interval of some twenty five years from most of those included in the volume of his earlier writings in the present series the de trinitate though begun perhaps as early as 400 was not finished before 417 augustine’s own words in the dedi catory letter to aurelius bishop of carthage are i was young when i began it an old man when i published it which sug gests an even longer period of composition though in roman usage a man of forty was still d juvenis we may take the year 410 as an approximate terminus a quo for the writing of the second half of the treatise which begins with book viii and contains much the most original and interesting part of augustine’s thought on the subject there has been room for a complete translation only of books viii ix x xiv and xv but the introduction attempts to survey the whole work and sum maries are given of the argument of books xi xiii preface 14 the de spiritu et littera was written in 412 soon after the pelagian doctrines had gained notoriety in africa by the con demnation of caelestius but before augustine had been led to study the writings of pelagius and embark upon their refutation in detail thus it has the advantage of offering a positive state ment of the writer’s understanding of st paul rather than a controversial argument against pelagianism it is translated in fuu the tractatus in epistolam lohannis were almost certainly delivered at eastertide in the year 415 when augustine’s most pressing concern was the final elimination of donatism in his own diocese although direct references to the donatists are not more than occasional the homilies can only be appreciated against the background of the schism and tliis background is sketched in the introduction the homilies have been consider ably abbreviated in translation but it is hoped that this has been done without serious loss the selection has been made in order to provide examples of the finest works of augustine as speculative and mystical theologian as doctor gratiae and as preacher of charity the translator’s aim has been to reproduce three acknowledged masterpieces of the greatest man who ever wrote latin 1 in an english which will not be intolerably irksome to read this can only be achieved by a fairly liberal though not unscrupulous use of paraphrase and in the homilies especially by a fairly severe pruning of the preacher’s luxuriance in rhetorical ques tion and repetition reference to previous translations has been deliberately avoided there is very seldom any difficulty in see ing what augustine’s latin means in the translation of augustine’s biblical quotations his own text has been carefully followed it must be remembered that he used one or other of the old latin versions current in africa when he became bishop jerome’s revised version the vulgate became available by the year 400 in the new testament it was not conspicuously different from the old latin and augustine regularly used it for the gospels but he was most reluctant to substitute jerome’s version of the old testament made direct from the hebrew for the old latin based on the septuagint which for augustine was an inspired text thus his old testa ment quotations often differ widely from the versions with which we are familiar 1 the judgement of professor alexander souter of aberdeen in vol xi p 150 preface 15 there has not been space for more than a minimum of ex planatory notes but the separate introductions to each work are designed to make them reasonably intelligible to the ordin ary reader who must not be unduly discouraged m the case of the de tnnitate by its author’s gloomy prophecy in a letter to his brother bishop evodius ep 169 that few people would be able to understand it the text used is the benedictine in its second paris edition of 1836 8 except for the de spintu et littera which is the only work of the three to have been issued in a critical modern text in the vienna corpus scriptorum ecclesiasticorum latinorum for convenience of reference to the original the numeration of sections follows that of the benedictine edition cambridge st augustine s day j b the trinity introduction at the beginning of the fourth century the za christian religion which had for so long been regarded z jlas a menace to the unity and stability of the roman empire was adopted by a sudden volte face of its persecutor as the religion of the state to serve the very purpose which it had been deemed to threaten that purpose could only be served by a church at unity in itself possessed of a clearly defined and universally accepted system of belief the church was therefore compelled to think out and formulate the doctrine of god involved in the christian gospel this was indeed a process which had been going on in the church from the first through out the second and third centuries the apostolic tradition had had to meet the challenge of rational thought the first great essay in systematic theology had been made by origen at alexandria the intellectual centre of the empire but the speculative system of origen had not claimed the status of orthodoxy and had encouraged rather than restricted the independent activity of christian thinkers so it was an attempt to rationalize the christian doctrine of god made by heretics who could claim to be followers of the great alexandrian that demanded from the church at the critical moment of her summons to give a religion to the empire a sustained effort of her common mind the arians believed themselves to be contending for biblical and rational monotheism the church had always preached the one god against the polytheistic cults of greece and rome yet its own faith and worship had been given to three when reason faced the apparent inconsistency it was natural that some should take for their starting point the axiom of divine 17 l8 augustine latee works unity while others began with the traditional expressions of christian religious experience the former approach led in the direction of the sabellian solution representing the one god as successively revealed in three temporal forms of activity god is three tor us as we learn to know him in time but eternally one in himself the latter would try to preserve the mon archy the unitary divine rule by subordinating the son to the father and the spirit to the son while maintaining the real and eternal distinction of the three in arianism this subordina tion was carried to the point of asserting a difference not only of status but of essential nature between father and son absolute godhead was reserved to the father alone as creator son and spirit are his creatures the purpose of the momentous decision of the council of nicaea making the confession of the son’s consubstantiality with the father a test of orthodoxy for office in the church was to insist that there can be no such de grees of divinity if christ be god he must be god tn the same sense as the father but the test word itself was so ambiguous as to arouse suspicion of a sabellian intention and it took half a century of controversy to reach a common consent on the two fundamentals of trinitarian doctrine that son and spirit must be confessed as alike truly god god without reservation and yet that father son and spirit are not mere names of one divine being or person it was the work of the great cap padocian fathers basil of caesarea and the two gregories of nyssa and nazianzus to incorporate these two principles in a christian doctrine of the one god which could be held with out self contradiction they distinguished between the substance or essence of godhead one and indivisible and the three forms of existence or objective embodiments of the one divine essence which constitute the persons they were well aware that this looked like a doctrine of three gods three particular subsis tences hypostases each possessing the common essence or nature of godhead and they endeavoured to defend them selves against the charge of tntheism by maintaining a that the godhead is one in operation without any division or separa tion of functions not as a harmony but as a single agency and b that the persons are one in beings inasmuch as son and spirit are both derived both spring eternally from one divine origin which is the father this was as far as trinitarian theology had advanced at the end of the fourth century the cappadocians were constructive theologians but their writings no less than those of athanasius the trinity 19 were the product of controversy and controversial in form of augustine’s latin predecessors hilary of pictavium called his treatise de tnmtate but devoted it entirely to establishing by anti arian argument the true godhead of the son and the same may be said of the de fide of ambrose in augustine’s de trinitate there is scarcely any element of controversy he begins by taking the catholic doctrine of god for granted observing bk i 7 iv that his predecessors have taught that father son and holy ghost mean a divine unity in an inseparable equality of one and the same substance and therefore are not three gods but one god though the father has begotten the son and therefore he who is father is not son the son is be gotten from the father and therefore he who is son is not father the holy spirit is neither father nor son but only spirit of father and son himself co equal with both and be longing to the unity of the trinity and he goes on to say that not the trinity but the son alone was incarnate crucified risen and ascended not the trinity but the spirit alone des cended upon christ at the baptism and upon the apostles at pentecost and not the trinity but the father pronounced the words thou art my son at baptism and transfiguration yet father son and holy spirit are inseparable in their working as well as in their being the first half of the de trinitate deals with the problems raised by the catholic doctrines a that god is one and that the whole trinity is active in all divine operations and b that the three persons are distinct from one another not only for our appre hension but in their eternal being books i iv are concerned with the interpretation of scrip ture on the assumption of the equal godhead of all three per sons when scripture texts referring to christ imply sub ordination of the son to the father this is generally to be explained on the lines which athanasius had laid down the son as incarnate has the form of a servant as well as the form of god and when scripture speaks of him as inferior to the father the reference is to his human nature only bk i augustine allows however that in some cases the reference may be to the form of god inasmuch as the son’s godhead is itself derived from the father here augustine follows the lead of the cappadocians but scripture tells us of missions of son and spirit in temporal history these signify visible manifesta tions of the second and third persons and are not to be limited to incarnation and pentecost for the word and the 20 augustine later works spirit have been active in the world since its creation before augustine the old testament theophanies were almost univer sally interpreted by the fathers as appearances of the son on the ground that the father is essentially invisible augustine believes that we have no reason so to limit their significance the whole trinity is essentially invisible to the eye of flesh but as cjod became visible to men in the incarnate word through his human body so we may believe for the manifestations of himself recorded in the old testament whether as trinity or as one or other of the several persons he used angelic agencies whose instruments were the natural and material potentialities implanted by god himself in the world of his crea tion bks ii and iii the supreme mission of the son is of course the incarnation bk iv augustine states its purpose in three aspects i to remedy men’s pride and men’s despair by displaying at once the depth of tlicir unworthiness and the greatness of god’s love ii to win for them a restoration of life both spintual and bodily by the sacrifice of the saviour’s death iii to restore them from division and dispersion into unity through incorporation in the one mediator for this purpose the son was manifested in the temporal and visible form of a creature which is what his mission means similarly the holy spirit is manifested at pentecost and in the church’s life and it was fitting both that the first mission should be of that divine person who is eternally begotten or derived from the father and that the second should be of the person who pro ceeds eternally from both father and son but no inequahty in the trinity is thereby implied in books v vii augustine passes from the interpretation of scripture the supreme authority on which the catholic faith is based to the formulation of the faith in terms of the logical and metaphysical categories which he shares like the greek fathers with contemporary philosophy especially the neo platonism of plotinus the metaphysics of plotinus distinguished within the eternal world of spiritual reality a trinity of the one mind and soul or life in which soul forms the link between spirit and matter eternal and temporal soul is both one and many and is itself product of the activity of self conscious mind mind thinking itself whereas mind in turn derives from the ultimate and absolute unity in which there is no distinction of subject and object the one is beyond being because to say that the one is would be to give it a second attribute in addi tion to its one ness being therefore for plotinus begins with the trinity 21 mind for augustine as a christian the one eternal being or substance is god himself the god whose name is i am of this divine substance the essential marks are unity and changelessness which are but negations of the creaturely char acter that belongs to all else that exists creaturely substance as such is not simple but composite and subject to change be cause of its composite nature change in a man means the loss of some attribute physical mental or moral which he form erly possessed but the loss of which does not involve his ceasing to be a man such attributes are called accidental god can not change without ceasing to be god for the substance of god is not compounded of parts but is absolutely one or simple this dogma of the divine simplicity as the logical ground both of unity and changelessness is common to augustine and greek theology in general it is expressed in the formula god is what he has and corresponds to the assertion of the medieval scholastics that in god essence and existence coincide the being of god is not like the being of a man separate from any of his attributes in technical terms god can have no accidental attnbutes and since god’s being is absolutely simple there is no real difference between one divme attribute and another god’s power god’s wisdom god’s goodness are one and the same thing book v introduces on the background of this metaphysic of substance augustine’s important distinction between sub stantive and relative terms in the theology of the trinity in the logic of substance it is true that all accidents imply the possibility of change and cannot therefore be predicated of the divine substance arians argued from this that the terms un begotten and begotten in their application to what is divine must denote substance and being contradictory must involve a difference in the substance of father and son but augustine replies it is not true that all predicates applicable to god denote substance they may denote eternal and unchangeable relations begotten is the same as son and sonship is relative to fatherhood unbegotten simply negates the relation of son ship the third person is related to the other two as gift to giver and this relation denotes an eternal potentiality in the godhead of giveableness even before the existence of crea tures to whom the spirit might be given terms such as lord which have no meaning apart from the created world denote an accident not in god but in the creature’s relation to him books vi and vii discuss the application of substantive 22 augustine later works terms to one or other of the persons as such christ is called the wisdom of god but it cannot be maintained as some of the orthodox opponents of arianism had done that wisdom belongs to the father only by his generation of the son for wisdom is a term denoting substance and all such terms belong to godhead as godhead god is what he has m him to be is to be wise the trinity is not a triplicity an organism of parts the equality of the persons means that each possesses the whole substance of godhead the son is therefore wisdom from wis dom just as he is god from god scripture applies the term especially to the son inasmuch as his incarnation provides the pattern of the divine wisdom which men are called to follow augustine discusses at length the theological terms used to de note the distinctions withm the godhead and finds that these terms are inevitably unsatisfactory both the greek hypostasis and the latin persona in ordinary usage are terms of substance not relation in the proper sense the person of god is his essen tial being his substance we can only use the term person in its trinitarian application awfe de mieux and must always bear in mind that in the theology of the trinity it does not bear its ordinary sense its implication is negative the father is not the son etc rather than positive it is clear that in this sifting of the proper application of theological terms augustine has so far not advanced beyond the position of the cappadocian fathers he has not main tained what indeed would be meaningless that the persons of the trinity are relations for he knows that a relation is nothing but a logical term predicable of that which is or pos sesses substance he has simply pointed out that what differen tiates the divine substance as it exists in the several persons of the trinity is a specific form of relation which in no way affects the substantial equality of the persons but he has done no more than the cappadocians to make the unity of the divine substance in three persons intelhgible the substance of god head might still be conceived not as a concrete reality but as an abstract or general notion realized only in three individual beings who are in fact three gods the purpose of the second half of the de tnnitate bks viii xv is not to work out a speculative re formulation of trini tarian doctrine but to seek for an understanding of what has been believed it must be noted that faith the act of believing throughout our treatise has the meaning of acceptance of the christian gospel as proclaimed on the authority of the church the trinity 23 augustine is aware that christian faith involves the trustful commitment of the whole self to christ but it is plain to him that such personal commitment must be grounded on accept ance both of the historical facts of the gospel and of the author itative interpretation of these facts by the church and this acceptance is necessarily the acceptance of a testimony which is deemed sufficient whether it be the teaching of scripture or that of tradition at the beginning of book viii augustine announces his intention of endeavouring to present the content of faith to the grasp of the understanding by a more inward way this more inward way is that which as he tells us in the vllth book of the confessions he had been taught to follow by his reading of the books of the platonists the way of returning into himself and looking for god within it is the method of introspection of which augusdne was so great a master he believes himself fully justified in seeking in the nature of the human soul for a pointer towards the under standing of the trinity for it is a matter of faith that god is manifested in the things that are made rom.i 20 3 and that of all the things that are made it is man and man only that is made in the image of god but just because augustine is re solved whether his search for understanding prove successful or not to hold fast to the data which faith provides the search itself cannot be free or unprejudiced he knows already what he is looking for his discoveries are in large measure predetermined if there is indeed an image of god in the human soul it must be a unity in trinity it must that is disclose three realities which are consubstantial in the sense that one and the same substance is exhibited in all of them without any difference or inequality and these three must be distinct from one another solely in vir tue of their mutual relations these relations again cannot be relations of parts to a whole for in that case the one substance could not be present in each of them in its entirety it is there fore not surprising that we find a tendency in the course of the psychological discussions which occupy so much of the books with which we are concerned to leap to the desired conclusion and translate psychological into theological terms but it says much for the honesty and integrity of augustine’s introspective research that at the end of it he is careful in bk xv to em phasize and elaborate not the perfection of the image but its inadequacy at the best we see god in his image per speculum in aenigmate through a glass darkly to speak of augustine’s doctrine of the trimty as psychological and therefore umtarian 24 augustine later works in tendency is seriously to misapprehend his purpose as we have already seen he will employ the term persona of the dis tinctions within the godhead only with the reservation that it is no more than an indispensable label but that is because person in normal usage denotes an independently existing substance and therefore can properly be predicated only of god as god not of the divine being as differentiated in a system of relations how far augustine is in fact from conceiving the godhead as uni personal is shown by the way in which he dwells in bk xv upon this very point of difference between imagp and original the human trinity he says belongs to an ego to a single person the persons of the divine trinity are not one but three although the trinity of three persons is more inseparable than the imaged trinity of one xv 43 xxiii it is not necessary to suppose that here augustine has forgotten his own caveat against the application of the word person in its ordinary sense to the members of the divine trinity and has slipped into employing it univocally of the human and the divine he is insisting that whereas in the human individual the ultimate reality is one and not three this is not to be said of god in the divine being three ness and one ness are both equally ultimate in christian theology neither is unity prior to multiplicity as in neo platonism nor is multiplicity prior to unity as in any form of tritheism in the retractations augustine says that his treatise de vera religione the last work which he wrote as a layman i.e about the year 390 was designed to present true religion as the worship of the one true god that is the trinity of father son and holy spirit in the last chapter of this work of which the philosophy is still strongly neo platonist he had asserted his worship of one god the one beginning of all things the wisdom by which every wise soul is wise and the gift by which all things blessed are blessed the trinity of one substance the beginning to which we return the form or pattern we follow after the grace by which we are reconciled the one god whose creation gives us life through whose re forming we live wisely by the love and enjoyment of whom we live blessedly this is the basic trinitarian pattern which augustine re tained all through his theological development there is a brief reference to it some ten years later in the confessions xiii 12 xi where he calls his readers to contemplate the triad of being knowing and willing in themselves a triad which the trinity 25 is indeed tar other than the divine trinity but in which there is nevertheless an inseparable life one life one mind one essencd this phrase recurs in de trin x 18 xi an in separable distinction which is still a distinction he plays on the same theme with elaborate variations in book xi of the de civitate dei which is probably later in composition than most of the de trinitate the whole trinity is made known to us in its works thence has the holy city its origin its inform ing and its beatitude ask what gives it being we answer god’s creation ask what gives it wisdom we answer god’s en lightening ask what gives it happiness we answer the enjoy ment of god in existence it is controlled in contemplation it is illumined in union it has delight it is it beholds it loves in god’s eternity it is strong in god’s truth it shines in god’s goodness it rejoices xi 24 to the same pattern corresponds the traditional division of secular philosophy into physics logic and ethics xi 25 finally in our own being knowledge and love we can recognize an image of the trinity the creator to whom belongs true eternity eternal truth eternal and true charity contemplating that image in ourselves we are moved like the younger son in the gospel to return to ourselves to arise and make our way back to him from whom our sins had drawn us away there our being will meet no death our know ing no mistaking our loving no failure xi 26 28 in the de trinitate the second and third members of this triadic pattern are retained throughout the search for the image of god in the soul the first member however being existence or life ap pears only when in book x augustine is enumerating the cer tainties of self knowledge we know for certain that we exist or live that we think that we will but being existence figures in none of the psychological triads to which detailed study is given the reason for this is evidently that augustine needs three terms which imply relations whereas being is not relative and cannot serve as distinctive analogue for any one person in the trinity and it will have been partly for this reason that the first of his images of the trinity the triad of mind knowledge and love is replaced by the second triad of memory under standing and will for mind as he is obliged to admit is an absolute and not a relative term augustine tells us in the ret actations that before he had finished book xii of the de trimtate certain persons got hold of what he had already written and put it into circulation without his permission we can understand his vexation at first he was 26 augustine later works inclined to drop the whole project and publish only a statement of what had taken place against his will but he yielded as he generally did to the entreaties of his friends he revised and completed his work with its last three books and sent it to the bishop of carthage aurelius with a letter which he asked to have prefixed to any published version in this letter he ex plains that his annoyance at the premature circulation of the unfinished work was not only because it needed a thorough re vision but because it had been planned to be read as a whole because each part was linked to what preceded in an advancing enquiry this insistence upon the order and connection of the treatise has often been neglected and the various images of the trinity in the last seven books have been treated as though they had little or no logical dependence upon one another it is true that augustine’s literary method is digressive though even his digressions are often no more than longish footnotes but his work is never shapeless the last eight books of the de trinitate do present an advancing enquiry book viii prepares the way for what is to follow aber a preliminary warning against the application of ordinary quan titative ideas of number and magnitude to trinitarian theology augustine endeavours to show that our natural make up as thinking and willing beings points us to god as the truth which is the ultimate object of knowledge and the good which is the ultimate satisfaction of desire but the knowledge and the love of god are inseparable in order to know god we must love him and scripture assures us that in love itself god is known to us as a present reality the nature of love involving subject object and relation already indicates a three in one it is not however augustine’s intention to dwell on this trinity of love he passes immediately in book ix to apply what he has said of the inseparabihty of knowing and willing cognition and conation to the discovery of a trinity in the mind that knows and wills at once the enquiry is determined by its purpose if there is an image of the triune god in the human soul it must be a self contained trinity of mutually related terms the mind’s knowing and willing must therefore be regarded as re flexive directed inwards upon itself and not outwards upon other objects so the image proposed in book ix is mind its knowledge of itself and its love of itself and having shown that this human trinity is in fact like the divine trinity of one sub stance in which the three terms display both co equality and mutual relatedness augustine does not hesitate to apply to it the trinity 27 the traditional language of theology the second person of the trinity is son word and image of the first the third is not begotten but proceeding similarly the mind’s self knowledge if it is a true knowledge is an expression or vord which can be described as begotten from the mind of which it is a kind of image or likeness while the realization of this self knowledge presumes a movement of will which proceeds from the mind as capable of self knowledge and finds its satisfaction in the self knowledge realized in the word thus we are led through this reference to the divine original from a purely static account of the mental trinity to a dynamic one the whole of book x is occupied with the process by which the mind comes to know itself in its true word or expres sion the process is a kind of search of which the motive is love in the sense of desire or appetition augustine establishes at length the principle that there can be no love for what is un known from which it follows that the mind could not seek for a knowledge of itself unless it were already in some sense known to itself the solution of the problem is found in the conception which augustine has acquired from plotinus of self recollec tion all men possess a knowledge of their own real being as a spiritual activity of thought and wiu but this knowledge has been obscured by an over lay of false notions derived from the material world so we have forgotten ourselves but the memory of what we are persists in modern phrase below the level of consciousness and only needs to be recalled by re flection the human mind can be certain that it possesses memory understanding and will and this offers to our view what augustine calls a more evident trimty which like the first is understood reflexively of the mind’s remembering understanding and willing itself what makes this second trinity more evident clearer and what is its relation to the previous triad of mind its self know ledge and its self love thomas aquinas approaching the question with the aristotelian distinctions of habit and act the potential and the actual in his mind supposed that augus tine’s first tnad described the structure of the mind in potentia as capable of self knowledge and self love whereas the second presents these potencies as realized in conscious activity and a modern follower of thomas has argued that the second and 1 a gardeilj la structure de pame et p experience mystique vol i pp 21 130 the important passages in thomas are i sent dist 3 qu v and de veritate qu x a 3 augustine later works 28 third terms of the first triad knowledge and love are to be understood in a passive sense as equivalent to the mind itself in its two essential capacities for being known and being loved by itself and further that these two terms denoting capacities as yet unrealized together compose the memory which appears as first term of the second triad and thus link the two trinities to one another genetically the second emerges from the first augustine certainly gives us no hint of his having envisaged his two trinities in this way and it is very doubtful whether he can actually have done so it must be remembered that the triad of mind self knowledge and self love was suggested by a con sideration of the trinity of subject object and relation to be discerned in the nature of love in the self conscious mind sub ject and object are the same and can only form one term of the triad the other two terms are relations which are both active and passive active in the mind as subject and passive in the mind as object the mind knows and loves itself as subject is known and loved by itself as object moreover it is in book ix and still within the frame of the first trinity that augustine develops his conception of the birth of the mental word which is of course in thomist terms an act and not a habit and which at the end of the same book is expressly identified with the mind’s self knowledge this seems fatal to thomas’s distinction between the first triad as purely potential and the second as actual the fact is rather as augustine says at the conclusion of his study of the first triad in book ix ix 9 vi that the human mind as thus analysed is not a changeless lieing but a life in the making and what we need to know is not so much what it is but what according to the everlasting law of god it ought to be henceforth the true image of the divine trinity must be sought in the mind as god means it to be and as it cannot and will not be until its renewal by the grace of god is complete this renewal is the subject of book xiv the three inter vening books xi xii and xiii of which only brief sum maries are given in this volume have the appearance of suc cessive excursus or digressions which break the continuity of the argument but augustine knows what he is about when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is the divine likened in the human soul will be perfectly realized only when god himself and not his created image becomes the object of the soul’s loving contemplation but the christian life is a gradual ascent to tiiis contemplation in which the soul the trinity 29 must use the things of its outward environment things spatial and temporal in order that it may rise above them in parti cular the significance of the time factor has been brought out by the discussion in book x of the mind’s search for self know ledge and the introduction of the notions of memory and recol lection the thinking or reflection which is needed in order to realize in the mind its trinity of memory understanding and will is a conscious process occurring in time in book xi augustine seeks to illustrate this temporal process by a study of sense perception at first sight this is a retrograde step for the field of sense perception belongs to the outward man though the inward is involved in it but it is reculer pour mieux sauter for the examination of the trinity of sense leads to that of the trinity of imagination based upon sense perception in which the actual working of memory and recollection can be followed in its simplest form images of things seen are stored in the memory and are re presented to the inward vision under standing by the voluntary act of attention will this is still so far a trinity of the outward man inasmuch as it is depen dent upon the deliveries of the bodily senses but it reminds us that the outward and inward man are in this life linked together in a single organism the nature of this union what augustine calls die confine or borderland of outward and inward is studied in book xii in which the reasonable soul is shown to have a two fold activity the one that of dealing by rational judgment with the objects and events of the extemsi world and its temporal experiences the other that of contem plating the inward and eternal world of truth applying to this distinction the texts of i cor 12 8 and job 28 28 together with col 2 3 augustine gives to the two functions the names of knowledge scientia and wisdom sapientia knowledge is the sphere of the lower reason which has its proper place and function as servant of the higher but because it is con cerned with the transient the life we lead in time it must never become the dominant partner but always be held in conscious subordination to the higher to the growth and perfecting of the wisdom which is worship the fear of the lord in other words augustine like plotinus insists that the true end of man is not action but contemplation and this means that the perfect image of god can only be found in the mind at worship for augustine this relation of action to contemplation of knowledge to wisdom of the life of man in time to his worship in eternity corresponds to the difference between faith and augustine later works 30 sight christian faith no less than christian conduct is con cerned with things temporal for faith rests upon the history of our salvation the things wrought in time by the incarnate word on our behalf and this fides historica as the only sure ground on which man’s natural desire for a well being that is not destroyed by death can look for satisfaction is the subject of book xiii the believing mind holds the content of this faith in memory and realizes it in conscious thought by the act of loving attention but this trinity of faith is itself transient be cause its object belongs to the realm of time the christian life in time is a passage through knowledge to wisdom xiii 24 xix so augustine returns to the point reached at the end of book x he has cleared the way for his final identification in book xiv of the image of the trinity in the human soul with that soul’s perfecting in wisdom where god himself is the ob ject of the mind’s memory understanding and will where the mind’s knowledge of itself is the knowledge that it is god’s image enabling it so to fix its contemplation no longer upon itself but upon god xiv 1 5 xii the soul of man is made for eternal life and that means that the image of god in it cannot finally be identified with anything that is confined to its activity in time the mind as god’s creation is endowed with a natural capacity for the remembering understanding and willing of itself and when these powers are rightly directed the self will be recognized in its true order of being in relation to the god whose image it is in our fallen condition sin holds this natural capacity in abeyance but can never destroy it it is in fact what alone makes possible the work of grace grace awakens the dor mant power of the mind to see god’s image in itself to see itself that is as god’s image christian faith the belief in the historic acts of incarnation and redemption and the life of christian practice issuing from that faith are the means which grace employs in this re fashioning of the soul what augustine is saying in effect is this the church teaches us to believe that god is trinity one eternal being in three related persons but to understand what we have believed is only possible in the measure in which the gratia chnsti enables us to recover in our selves that image which the triune god imprinted on us in our creation the inspiration of the be tnnitate is as much devo tional as theological to sum up augustine recognizes and distinguishes three phases of the divine image in man there is first the ineradic the trinity 31 able likeness to god in which man is created belonging to his essential nature there is secondly the temporal and progressive recovery of this likeness obscured by sin which takes effect in the christian life under the influence of grace and there will be thirdly the perfection and maturity of the likeness in the life to come when knowledge shall have given place to wisdom in that state of glory which is the vision of god in this life it is impossible for us just because we are travel lers in via to anticipate the perfecting of the divine image nevertheless augustine will attempt in book xv to lift our thoughts from the image to the original and since the image in its perfection is beyond our present experience he will make his comparison between the image as we know it in its fallen and disfigured state and the original after which it was created xv 39 xx he draws out the differences both formal and material bodi in respect of triunity and in respect of the corres pondence between the several members of the human and divine trinities respectively the only criterion at his disposal is the authoritative dogma based on scripture and tradition and accepted by faith the christian is bound to believe that what for lack of a better word he calls the persons of the trinity are one god because they differ from one another only by the relations in which they stand to one another but this is not the case with the human trinity of memory under standing and will these are three specific functions which make up or constitute the spiritual being of a man and they differ from one another essentially in themselves and not merely in their mutual relations behind the three powers or faculties of the mind there is the human person the ego who is the ultimate subject of their exercise it is i not my memory that under stands and wills i not my understanding that remembers and wills i not my will that remembers and understands whereas in the divine trinity full personality must belong to each person the persons are not faculties or functions of a divine ego on the other hand augustine believes that the value of his analysis of the mental trinity goes further than to show how three things can at the same time be one he discerns a real image of ae father in memory of the son in understanding and of the spirit in will xv 43 xxiii in the case of the first person the likeness consists simply in the character of memory as the source or fount both of understanding and of will it is to be noted that while augustine augustine later works 32 retains this conception of the divine fatherhood as a relation within the godhead he does not follow the cappadocians in treating it as constitutive of unity for the second person the ground of the likeness is of course the scriptural and traditional doctrine of the divine word in the fathers before augustine the logos doctrine had displayed a continual wavering be tween the biblical conception of the word of god as the revelation to men of his will and purpose and the greek philo sophical idea of the divine reason immanent in the cosmos since human speech is the instrument of rational thought the spoken word of god could naturally be conceived as the expression of the reason which is eternally in god his word is also his wis dom the second century apologists in their endeavour to take advantage in the christian interest of the stoic belief in reason as the formative cosmic principle had attempted to interpret the sonship of the logos as god’s begetting or bringing forth his rational purpose in the creation of the world this proved a false step which had to be corrected by origen with his doc trine of the eternal generation of the son but neither ongen nor his followers made use of psychological analogy in their presentation of the doctrine indeed augustine’s only impor tant predecessor in this respect was tertullian who argued in his adversus praxean c 5 that both reason and word must be conceived as existing in god before the world’s creation com paring the unspoken word or dialogue in the mind which is involved in the process of human thinking and justifying his comparison on the ground of man’s making in the image and likeness of god augustine’s treatment of the subject is plainly inspired by the neo platonist theory of self conscious mind nous which is both subject and object of thought and so contains a duality in itself in augustine’s mental trinities the mind’s self knowledge and self understanding closely correspond to the self contem plating activity which plotinus ascribes to nous the human mind in the act of conscious recognition of itself begets an image of itself which is true when it fully corresponds to the self which it reproduces in the utterance of its inward word so in the divine trinity the son is the eternal self reproduction of the father and this is the primary significance of the word as title of the second person in book xv however augustine does not confine his comparison of human and divine words as we might have expected to this reflexive aspect of self consciousness he considers the word both in man and god the trinity 33 as a cognizance taken not only of the cognizing self but of other things as well and so draws his contrast between the scanty con tent of all human knowledge and the divine omniscience he has been led to this extension by his treatment of the image as perfected in wisdom for the divine wisdom is more than self knowledge it is the knowledge of all things but though scrip ture speaks of christ as the wisdom of god wisdom is not like word a distinctive title of the second person of the trinity but an essential attribute of godhead and the son is therefore wisdom only as being trom wisdom as he is god trom god augustine has previously established this point in book vii where he explains the scripture's appropriation of the name wisdom to the second person on the ground that the word incarnate reveals to men the pattern of the divine wis dom in whose image they were made and must be re made in this way as we can see augustine finds place for the revela tional or declaratory function of the word the son took flesh as our inward word clothes itself in spoken language for the purpose of communication xv 20 xi it remains true however that the aim of the de tnmtate in regard to the second person of the trinity is to find within the human image an analogue of the word that was in the beginning with god and to show the appropriateness of the idea of filiation to designate the express image of the father’s hypostasis heb 1 3 and it is upon this eternal relation of son to father in the godhead that in augustine's view the work of the second person in revelation and redemption depends in the application of the third member of his mental trinity to the person of the holy spirit the work of augustine is much more original and determinative for the history of trinitarian theology and it is of course intimately involved in his own doc trine of grace there is surprisingly little allusion to pelagian errors even in the later books of the de trinitate but the pauline text the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit which is given us which is the main theme of the refutation of pelagianism in the de spiritu et littera gives the key to the appropriation of charity to the spirit in our treatise the text of john god is agape forbids the identification of any one person of the trinity with charity augustine will not go further than to claim justification for giving the name of charity in a special sense to the spirit exactly as the name of wisdom may be given in a special sense to the son in both cases the usage of scripture is the sufficient authority but augustine later works 34 charity like wisdom is properly a substantive term applicable to god in himself or to each and every person of the trinity qua possessed of godhead the relational term for the third person is gift the difficulty here is that this term in scripture plainly denotes the spirit as given to men and augustine hesi tates to transfer the notion directly to an inter personal relation within the eternal being of the godhead he says that the spirit is eternally gift as being eternally giveable whereas his giving is a temporal event v i6 xv but it is abundantly clear from the persistence with which the function of will or love in the human trinity is described as bringing together or uniting the other two members of the triad that the guiding thought is of the spirit as the vinculum trinitatis the bond or communion of father and son father and son are alike and equally holy alike and equally spirit ploly spirit is common to both and may therefore most fittingly be spoken of as the mutual charity whereby the father and the son love one another xv 27 xvii the conclusion lies very near though augustine does not draw it in so many words that chanty is communion because it is self giving as charity from charity the spirit when given to men binds them in union to god making the whole trinity have its habitation within us xv 32 xviii the love whereby wc love god is god’s gift of himself and apart from him wc can do nothing thus what was really at stake in the pelagian controversy was the reality of the divine presence through grace in the soul of man kote on terminology it is impossible in translation to convey the exact meaning of the keywords in augustine’s analysis of the image of tlie trinity in man the most important of these are mens mind intelligentia understanding memoria memory amor love and charitas charity 1 mens mind in augustine’s usage stands for the ele ment in human nature by which it is distinguished from any thing possessed in common with the lower animals it connotes especially the power of reasoning but it does not mean the intellect in our sense of the word it is rather the rational soul which feels desires and wills as well as thinks 2 intelligentia for this word understanding is the only convenient equivalent but it has the serious disadvantage of suggesting comprehension in the sense of appreciating the the trinity 35 significance of an idea or a proposition and observing its logical connection with the rest of our knowledge augustine always thinks as a platonist of the objects of knowledge as so many concrete realities laid up in heaven and like plato he can only describe the knowing mind’s relation to these realities in terms of the most noble of our bodily senses that of sight the difference between faith and understanding is the differ ence between indirect acquaintance on the basis of another’s testimony and the immediacy of vision at first hand to understand therefore is simply to see with the mind to apprehend rather than comprehend and the act of under standing is intuitive not discursive 3 memoria memory is augustine’s word for the reten tion of experience in the human mind as memory the mind is a storehouse in which traces of the passing experience are pre served but we only remember what is in the store house by entering it as it were and looking in it for what we want or as in the case of involuntary recollection by stumbling upon some particular item of its content thus the augustinian memory corresponds roughly to the modem notion of the sub con scious or the unconscious but augustine believes that the content of the unconscious is not limited to the traces left by sense perception for the mind at birth is more than a tabula rasa dependent entirely upon impressions from the external world being the creation of god and bearing the image of god the mind must always retain a knowledge of its own nature as god’s created image and thus it must possess a memory of god which is indelible however deeply hidden away 4 amor and charitas the primary connotation of love in augustine is desire it is the motive of all human action the source of energy which compels a man to seek the satisfac tion of his needs and augustine compares it to the force of gravity my weight is my love by it i am carried whither soever i move confessions y xiii 10 ix the end which love pursues is fruition enjoyment and the quality of love de pends on that of the objects whose enjoyment is sought it is therefore neither good nor bad in itself when it is directed towards lower things in the scale of existence it will be evil unless such things are desired only as means towards the attain ment of man’s true end the fruition of god and of one another in god de civitate xix 13 thus love amor is a neutral term if it seeks final satisfaction in what is lower it is covetousness concupiscentia i if it is directed ultimately 36 augustine later works upon god or in augustine’s phrase referred to god it is charity but it is important to observe that both amor and chantas include feeling as well as striving or conation indeed it is the affective element in love that supplies its dynamic in virtue of this affective element love does not cease to exist when it has attained its object so augustine can define love as nothing else but the will seeking after or holding in possession an object of enjoyment de trin xiv 8 vi a definition which makes clear the difference in connotation between will and love the two words denote one and the same activity but voluntas fixes attention upon the conative element in this activity while amor always connotes feeling the trinity book viii the search for god by the understanding argument terms which distingxiish the persons of the trinity from one another denote relations only terms applicable equally to each person and to the whole trinity denote substance or essence how can we apprehend the divine essence the first necessity is to dismiss the quantitative notions which we acquire from the world of sense perception the persons of the trinity are co equal simply because in absolute truth or reality there can be no degrees we cannot grasp otherwise than by momentary intuition the conception of ultimate truth reality because our minds are weakened by sin and error 1 3 it may be easier to reach the conception of god’s essence as goodness the universal good which is implied by the existence of particular good things and our ability to recognize them as good the soul can win or lose goodness and this implies a goodness that is independent of the soul towards which or away from which the soul can move 4 5 the soul can hold to the supreme good only by love and love for its advance to the knowledge of vision must be supported by the knowledge of faith 6 our beliefs with regard to matten with which we are not directly acquainted e.g the facts of the gospel story are grounded not on the mental picture which we form of them and which is usually erroneous but on general or abstract ideas 7 but our belief in the trinity our belief in god cannot be based on any general idea 8 our love e.g for paul is love of the righteous soul and we know what soul is because we ourselves are souls but if we are not righteous ourselves how can we know what righteousness is and without knowing it 37 augustine later works 38 how can we love it the knowledge must somehow be in our selves though not derived from sense perception it can be based only on a form or pattern actually present to the soul which can hold to it only by way of love 9 what is the nature of this love simply the vill to righteous ness for ourselves and for others but the love of neighbour ultimately depends on the love of god and the love of god is the love not of power but of love 10 ii because god is love we can know him when we love our brother but how is the knowledge of love charity the knowledge of god as trinity all love must have an object and john’s epistle teaches us that the love which has a brother for its object is not only of god but god but we cannot love a brother without also loving love in other words the two great com mandments are inseparable 12 paul’s description of the character of god’s ministers ii cor ch 6 kindles our love through its correspondence with the pattern present to our inward vision 13 and all love implies besides itself a loving subject and a loved object three entities one of which love is link between the other two the text i we have already observed that the only terms which can strictly be applied to distinguish the several persons of the trinity are those which denote their mutal relations father son and holy spirit gift of both the trinity is neither father nor son nor gift but the terms applicable to the several persons regarded in themselves denote not three beings in the plural but one that is the trinity itself thus the father is god the son god the holy spirit god the father is good the son good the holy spirit good the father almighty the son almighty the holy spirit almighty yet there are not three gods or three good or three almighty but one god good almighty the trinity itself and so for every other term which denotes not a mutual relation but the several persons regarded in them selves we may describe such terms as essential for the essence or being of god is the same as his being great good wise and anything else which is true either of each several person or of the trinity itself we use the expression three persons or three substances not to suggest any difference in essence but 1 phraseology adopted in the quicumque vult the trinity 39 to furnish ourselves with some one word by which to answer the question what are these three in this trinity there is an absolute equality in divinity the father is not greater than the son nor are the father and the son together greater than the holy spirit nor is any single person of the three anything less than the trinity itself all this has been said before and repetition may familiarize our minds with the idea but there must be a limit to repetition let us now beseech god with reverent devotion that he will open our understandings and remove from us all contentiousness of spirit so that our mind may contemplate the essence of truth free from all thought of physical mass or motion it is now our purpose so far as the creator’s own wonderful mercy may assist us to address ourselves to the same theme as before but by a more inward method of approach still observing the same rule that the truth which has not yet become luminous to our under standing be still held fast by faith 2 i we say that in this trimty two or three persons are not any greater thing than one of them our material habit of thought fails to grasp this simply because while it is aware ac cording to its capacity of those truly existing things which have been created it cannot perceive the truth itself which has created them if it could the fact of which we have spoken would be as clear as the light of day only truth itself has true being in its substance there is nothing greater but that which more truly is but in the realm of the spiritual and the changeless there cannot be degrees of truth for all is equally changeless and eternal what is called great is great only because it truly is if then greatness is truth itself to have more greatness must mean to have more truth that which has not more truth cannot have more greatness whatever has more truth is the truer just as whatever has more greatness is the greater in this realm therefore the truer is the greater but father and son together have no more true being than the father alone or the son alone both together then are no greater a thing than either of them singly and since the holy spirit no less truly is no more are 2 augustine has examined the inadequacy of the latin term persona and the greek hypostasis m book vi i see introduction p 22 3 throughout this passage truth stands for the platonic true being or absolute reality which belongs to nothing in the world of sense like plato augustine holds that m this world things have no more than a degree of reality varying according to their measure of likeness to or participation in the absolute reality or truth which is god himself augustine later works 40 father and son together anything greater than the spirit because they are nothing that more truly is the father and the holy spirit together since they do not surpass the son in truth for they have no more true a being do not surpass him in greatness so the son and the holy spirit together are as great a thing as the father alone because they no less truly are and the trinity itself has the same greatness as any one person the person who is not truer is not greater where truth itself is great ness in the essential being of truth to be true is to be to be is to be great to be great therefore is to be true here therefore what is equally true must be equally great 3 ii in the case of material things one piece of gold may be as true as another and yet not as great because here great ness is not the same thing as truth it is one thing to be gold another to be great similarly with the soul we do not call a soul true in respect of the same quality which makes us call it great a true soul belongs no less to him who is not great souled for the essence of body and soul is not the essence of truth itself as the trinity is god one sole great truly real really true true reality if we would conceive of him so far as he allows and vouchsafes we must conceive of no spatial con tact or connection no conjoined structure like that of the three bodied geryon in the legend any image of that kind greater in its three parts than in any one of them less in one than in two must be unhesitatingly rejected even as we reject everything that is material even in the world of spirit nothing that is changeable must be taken for god when we rise from the deep submergence in which we live and draw breath towards the heights of heaven it will be matter of no small knowledge for us before we are yet able to know what god is if we can at least know what he is not certainly he is neither earth nor sky nor of the nature of earth and sky or of anything that we see in the sky or that may perhaps exist there though we see it not multiply in your imagination the light of the sun make it greater and brighter as you will a thousand times or times out of number god will not be there conceive the being of pure angelic spirits animating celestial bodies changing and turn ing them at will for the service of god not if all those thousand thousands were brought together and made one will god be any such thing not even if you could conceive those same spirits i e not the stars but the celestial bodies of which paul speaks in i cor ch 15 but in enchtnd 15 iviu augustine says it may be that sun moon etc belong to the same company as the angels the trinity 41 as bodiless difficult as that is for our materially determined thinking behold if thou canst thou soul heavily burdened by the body of corruption laden with earthy conceits many and diverse behold if thou canst god is truth it is written for god is light not the hght seen by these eyes of ours but that which the heart sees upon hearing of the words he is truth ask not what is truth at once will rise the fogs of material images the thick clouds of phantasm and darken that clear empyrean which shone forth for a single instant upon your sight at that word truth in that instant that flash of vision that touches you with the word truth hold fast if you can but you cannot you fall back into this familiar world of earthly things and what i ask you is the weight that pulls you down again but the defilements contracted from the mire of passion and the delusions of your wanderings 4 iii try once again and consider the matter this way nothing draws your love but what is good good is earth with its lofty mountains its gentle hills its level plains good is the beauteous and fertile land good the well built house with its symmetry its spaciousness and light good are the bodies of living things good is the temperate and wholesome air good is the pleasant and healthful food good is health itself free from pain and weariness good is the human face with its regular features its cheerful expression its lively colouring good is the heart of a friend whose comradeship is sweet and whose love is loyal good is a righteous man good is wealth for the things it can enable us to do good is the sky with its sun moon and stars good are the angels of holy obedience good is the speech that instructs the hearer winningly and counsels him appro priately good is the poem of musical rhythm and profound thought but enough this is good and that is good take away this and that and look if you can upon good itself then you will see god good not by the possession of any other good thing but the goodness of every good for among all these good things those i have named and any others you may see or con ceive we could not pronounce with a true judgment any one better than another were there not imprinted on our mind the 5 the allusion is to wisdom 9 1 5 which expresses the greek view of the relation of body and soul 6 i john i 5 7 cf conf vii 1 7 this flash of vision and the inevitable relapse con stantly described by augustine is what he had experienced in his own attempts to achieve the mystic elevation of the neo platomst augustine later works 42 idea of good itself as the standard by which we should either approve or prefer so our love must rise to god not as we love this or that good thing but as the good itself the soul must needs seek that good over which it will not range superior as judge but to which it will cleave m love and what is that good but god not the good soul the good angel the good heavens but the good good perhaps this may make it easier to grasp what i mean when i hear for instance the phrase good soul those two words convey two things to my mind that there is a soul and that it is good it was no act of its own that made it a soul for it was not there to bring itself into being but for it to be a good soul i can see that voluntary action of its own was needed not that there is no good m its very existence as a soul for then it could not be called and truly called better than a body but it is not yet to be called a good soul because there needs yet the activity of will to give it excellence if that activity is neglected it rightly incurs blame and is properly called no good soul it differs from the soul that is so active and since the latter deserves praise clearly the former’s failure so to act must deserve censure but when a soul sets itself to this purpose and is becoming good it cannot achieve its end unless it be directed towards something which is not itself yet to what may the soul turn so as to become good but to the good loving pursuing attaining it if it turn away again and lose its goodness by the very act of turning away from good there will be nothing to which it may return once more if it desire to amend unless that good from which it is declining abides still in itself 5 it follows that there could be no changeable goods were there not a good that is changeless you hear the word good applied to this and that things which at another time may be called not good see then if you can pass beyond the things which are good by virtue of their share in goodness and rise to the vision of that good whose partial presence makes them good you must know the meaning of good itself when you hear that this or that is good if then you can set them aside and reach the sight of good in itself you will have reached the sight of god and if you shall cleave to him in love you will in that moment receive beatitude other things are loved only because they are s this notio bom is not of course the platonic tdea of good but its reflection in the mind augustine here describes what for him is only a theoretical possibility when he wrote the de tnmtate he had long ceased to believe that the vision of god was attainable in this life the trinity 43 good it were shame to stay cleaving to them and not to love the good itself which makes them good a soul may not yet have the goodness of conversion to the changeless good but simply as a soul we may give it a value if we rightly apprehend higher than that of any material luminary yet its value for us lies not in itself but m the creative art that made it it is our seeing that it was worth the making that makes us approve it as made this is the truth the absolute good nothing else but good itself and therefore the highest good for the only good that can be dimimshed or increased is that whose goodness is derived from another good the soul’s goodness then comes from its conversion to that same source which has made it a soul the soul’s perfecting in goodness comes from the conforming of will to nature when the will turns in love towards that good from which is derived the existence that cannot be lost even if the will turns away from its source when it turns away from the highest good the soul ceases to be a good soul but not to be a soul which is itself a good that is superior to body the will loses what the will gams for the soul already existed with power to will its turning towards its source but it was not there to will to be a soul before it existed the good for us is to see how it was or is right for that thing to be the rightness of which we can understand and if there is anything of which we cannot under stand the rightness to see that it could not have been unless it was right for it to be and this good is not far from each one of us for in him we live and move and have our being 6 iv but we have to stand fast by that good in love and cleave to it that we may enjoy the presence of him from whom we have our being and m whose absence we could not be at all we walk by faith as yet and not by sight not yet do we see god as the same apostle says face to face but unless we already love him we shall never see him yet how can we love what we do not know a thing may be known and not loved but we may question whether that which is not known can be loved if it cannot no one can love god before he knows him to know god means to perceive him with the assured grasp of the mind he is not a body to be observed with the eye of flesh but to see and apprehend god as he may be seen and apprehended is given to the pure in heart they we read are blessed for they shall see god and before we acts 17 27 f 11 ii cor 5 7 12 i cor 13 12 1 matt 5 8 augustine later works 44 have gained strength for that seeing there can be no purifying of the heart to make it fit to see him unless he be loved by faith faith hope and chanty those three virtues for whose building up is mounted all the scaffolding of the bible are only in the soul that believes what it sees not yet and hopes and loves what it beheves therefore there can be love even of him who is not known if yet he is beheved doubtless we must beware lest the soul believing what it does not see feign for itself an image of that which is not and put its hope and love upon a lie then there will not be that charity from a pure heart and a good conscience and a faith unfeigned which is the end of the com mandment as paul says 7 when we acquire beliefs from the reading or hearing of material things which we have not seen the mind cannot but form for itself some image in outhne and shape such as may present itself to thought but it will not be a true image or if it is as may very exceptionally happen there will be no advantage in retaining it for the maintenance of our belief though it may serve a purpose in suggesting to us something else most people who read or hear the wntings of paul or his history will form some picture of his appearance and of that of all the other per sons whose names occur in connection with his of all the many people who know his letters one will picture the forms and features of these persons in one way one in another but none can say whose picture is the nearest resemblance our belief is not concerned with the outward appearance of the men but only with the fact that by the grace of god their lives and doings were what the scripture tells us that is the belief which is both profitable and attainable and the belief we should seek for the bodily appearance of the lord himself is represented by an in numerable variety of mental images but whatever it actually was it was not more than one in our faith concerning the lord jesus christ the salutary element is not in the mental image which may be a long way from the facts but in the idea of man fixed in our knowledge is a definite standard of human nature by which we immediately recognize upon seeing that which conforms to it that this is a man or a human form v by this knowledge our thought is shaped when we believe that god was made man for us to be an example of humility and to prove god’s love towards us what is good for us to be 1 i tim 1 5 in what follows augustine uses the expression faith un feigned for a belief that is not grounded on baseless imagininp and so cannot deceive the trinity 45 lieve and to keep firm and unshaken in our hearts is that the humility whereby god was born of a woman and brought by mortal men that shameful way to death is the supreme medica ment for the healing of the cancer of our pride and the pro found mystery that can loose the fetters of sin so also it is because we have the idea of omnipotence that we believe the power of his miracles and of his resurrection to have come from the omnipotent god and we think of such facts in accordance with our systematic knowledge of general and specific notions whether innate or acquired by experience so that our faith be not feigned we do not know the appearance of the virgin mary of whom christ was marvellously born so that both in conceiving and in giving birth her virginity was preserved we do not know the figure of lazarus we have not seen bethany the grave or the stone which christ made them take away when he raised him from the dead nor that new tomb cut m the rock from which he himself rose nor the mount of olivet where he ascended into heaven and if we have not seen them we are wholly ignorant whether they are as we imagine them indeed we suppose it the more likely that they are not for if ever a place or a person or any physical object presents to our eyes the same appearance as it had in our imagination before we saw it we are struck with astomshment so rarely does it happen if ever yet we have a most firm belief in the gospel story because we conceive it in accordance with our assured knowledge of general and specific notions we believe that the lord jesus christ was born of a virgin called mary but what is a virgin what is to be bom what is a proper name we do not beheve but simply know whether mary had that form which comes to our mind when we tell or remember the story we neither know nor believe and so without damage to faith we may say per haps she was like this perhaps she was not but perhaps christ was born of a virgin is what no one can say without damage to his christian faith 8 now it is our desire to gain such understanding as may be granted us of the trinity its eternity its equality its unity but before we can understand we have to believe and we must take care that our faith be not feigned for our happiness rests upon the fruition of the trinity and if our belief about it be false our hope will be vain and our love not pure how then can we love through believing the trinity which we do not know the love which we can have for paul is based upon a knowledge of general and specific ideas we may be entirely ignorant of his augustine later works 46 appearance which may have been quite different from our imagination of it yet we know what a man is for we need go no further than what we are ourselves plainly paul was a man his soul was linked to a body and lived a mortal life we be lieve of him what we find in ourselves according to the genus or species in which every human nature is equally contained but knowledge of genus and species can tell us nothing of the trans cendent trinity there are not a number of such trinities ex perience of some of which could enable us to form a generalized notion and believe that the divine trinity is similar and so by analogy with what we know love that which not yet knowing we believe no we can love our lord jesus christ’s resurrection from the dead although we have never seen anyone so rise again but we cannot in the same way love through believing the trinity which we do not see and the like of which we have never seen we know what death and life are because we are alive and we have seen and experienced the death and the dying of others to rise again then is simply to return to life but when we say and believe that the trinity exists we know indeed what the word trinity means since we know the meaning of three but that is not what we love we can have three whenever we like by holding up three fingers is that which we love then not any trinity but the trinity which is god is it god in the trinity that we love but we neither have seen nor know any other god for there is but one only god whom we have not yet seen whom through believing we love the question is what likeness or comparability in things we know can form the belief by which we may love god before he is known 9 vi let us go back and consider why we love the apostle not surely because of that form of humanity which is familiar to us and which we believe he shared if it were so our love would now have no object for his soul and body are divided and he exists no longer in human form that which we love in him we believe is now living for we love the righteous soul but this implies reference to a pattern of genus or species that we know what a soul is and what righteous is now we may properly say that we know what a soul is because we our selves have a soul we have never seen it with our eyes or formed a generic conception from a number of things seen we know it the latin tnnitas means simply triad not three in one ness 16 augustine defines man as a reasonable soul having a body in jo ev tr xix 15 the trinity 47 because we have it i know nothing more intimately than that which i am aware of being that by which i am aware of all things else the soul itself the bodily movements by which we are aware of the hfe of others we recognize from their likeness to our own life makes us move our bodies as we observe other bodies moving when a hving body moves our eyes do not find their way in to a vision of the soul which eyes cannot see but we are aware that in that bodily mass there is something of the same kind as we have in ourselves to move our own bodily mass namely life and soul and this is not peculiar to human intelligence and reason animals are aware of hfe not only in themselves but in one another and in us they do not see our souls but become aware of them from movements of the body with a simple and instinctive immediacy from our own soul then we draw the knowledge of soul in anyone else and the belief of it when we do not know it we are not only aware of the soul but are able to know what soul is by the consideration of our own for we have a soul but how do we know what is righteous we said that the only reason for our love of the apostle is that he is a righteous soul we must know then what righteous is as well as what is soul what soul is we know from ourselves as we have said for there is soul in us but how do we know what is righteous if we are not righteous if none but he who is righteous knows what righteous is none can love the righteous but the righteous the mere belief that a man is righteous cannot make you love him if you do not know what righteous is as we have already shown one can only love what one believes with out seeing on the basis of some standard conception of genus or species if then none can love the righteous but the righteous how can anyone who is not yet righteous desire to be so for no one desires to be what he does not love yet it is impossible to become righteous without willing it and to will it one must love the righteous it follows that a man not yet righteous himself can love the righteous but this cannot be if he does not know what righteous is we must allow that a man not yet righteous may know the meaning of the word and we ask whence such knowledge comes clearly not by the visual sense a body is not righteous as it is white or black square or round and nothing but bodies are seen by the eyes the righteous element in man is the soul and a man is called righteous in virtue of his soul and not his body righteousness is a beauty of the soul which can exist in men whose bodies are deformed or ugly and the 48 augustine later works soul’s beauty no more than the soul itself is visible to the out ward eye whence then can a man not yet righteous learn the meaning of the word and through loving the righteous become righteous himself bodily movements might give indications of righteousness in this or that man but if one were wholly ig norant of the meaning of righteous one could not recognize that such were signs of a righteous soul the problem remains somehow or other we know what righteous means before we are righteous ourselves if that knowledge comes from the external world it must be derived from some bodily source but its object does not belong to the bodily realm at all it must therefore be in ourselves that we learn the meaning of the term righteous when i look for the proper way to describe it i can find the answer nowhere but in my own mind if i ask another man he must look vwthin for his answer and no one can give a true answer unless he has found it in himself when i want to describe carthage i enquire of myself and i find an image of carthage in my own mind but i have got it by way of sense perception having been in the town in bodily presence seen it and remembered it so that the right word will be at my disposal whenever i want to describe it its word is the actual image in my memory not the sound of two syllables when i say carthage nor the silent passing of the name through the mind it is the object of my inward vision when i pronounce or before i pronounce the two syllables car thage similarly if i want to describe alexandria which i have never seen an image of it is at my disposal i have been credibly informed that it is a great city and have constructed a picture of it as described to me to the best of my abihty and that is the word of it in my mind when i want to speak of it before i pronounce the five syllables of the well known name but if i could display my mental picture to people who know alexandria they would assuredly say that is not it or if they said it is i should be greatly surprised and when i considered the picture in my mind i should still not know that it was alexandria i should only believe those who had seen it but this is not how i enquire the meaning of righteous it is not how i find it or contemplate it when i describe it how my description is accepted or how i accept another’s descriptioii it is not as though i had seen anything of the kind or perceived it by any bodily sense or heard of it from others who had their knowledge in that way when i say and say with knowledge that the righteous soul is that which by rational principle in the trinity 49 life and conduct assigns to each his own not thinkng of an absent object hke carthage or imagining one like alex andria correctly or incorrectly i perceive something present perceive it in myself though i am not myself what i perceive many on hearing me may accept my description but whoever does so knowledgeably will himself be perceiving in himself the same thing though he be not himself what he perceives when a righteous man says it he is perceiving and saying what he himself is but he too perceives it in himself that is natural enough where should he see himself but in himself the sur prising thing is that the mind or soul should see in itself what it has seen nowhere else that it should see truly see the truly righteous soul being itself soul yet not the righteous soul which it sees in itself we can hardly suppose the presence of another righteous soul in the soul which is not yet righteous but then what is present to the soul when it sees and defines the righteous soul and sees it entirely in itself though itself is not righteous our answer is that what it sees is an inward truth present to the soul that has the power to contemplate it not all have the power and those that have are not all themselves what they contemplate not all themselves righteous souls though they can see and define the righteous soul they can only become it themselves by cleaving to that same form or pattern which they contemplate being conformed to it and becoming righteous souls not only perceiving and declaring that the righteous soul is that which by rational principle m life and conduct assigns to each his own but by making righteous life and conduct their own assigning to each his own owing no man anything but to love one another the only way of cleaving to that pattern is by love if we love another man whom we believe righteous we cannot but love the pattern itself which shows us what the righteous soul is in order that we too may become righteous indeed did we not love the pattern we could have no love for the man for our love for him is based upon the pattern it is only that so long as we are not righteous our love of it is insufficient to make us righteous our conclusion is that love for the man who is believed righteous is based upon that pattern and truth which the lover perceives and apprehends in himself but love for the pattern and the truth itself cannot be based upon anything extraneous 17 the definition of jusuua given by cicero in de ftn v 33 and set at the beginning of justinian’s institutes as the basis of roman law 18 rom 13 8 augustine later works 50 we cannot find anything outside itself so that our belief in it and our love for it when it is still unknown might be based on a previous knowledge of anything of the kind it is itself the thing you behold wherever you behold anything of the kind indeed there is nothing else of the kind for it alone is what it is accordingly our love for men must have their righteousness either as the cause or as the purpose of our love in the same way a man’s own righteousness must be either cause or purpose of his love for himself only so can he safely love his neighbour as himself if his self love has any other ground it is an un righteous self love for he will be loving himself so as to be un righteous and therefore to be evil so that it will be no real self love for he who loves iniquity hateth his own soul 10 vii it follows that in this enquiry concerning the trinity and our knowledge of god the first thing for us to learn is the nature of true love or rather the nature of love for only the love which is true deserves the name all other is covetous ness it is a misuse of language when the covetous are said to love as it is when those who love are said to covet the aim of true love is the life of righteousness in cleaving to the truth and this means that nothing in this world should have any weight for us beside the love of men which means the will that they may live righteously that gives all the value to the readiness to die for our brethren which the lord jesus christ taught us by his example there are two commandments on which hang all the law and the prophets love of god and love of neigh bour but it is not without reason that the scripture often puts one of them for both sometimes it is the love of god we know that all things work together for good to them that love god 1 whosoever loveth god he is known of god the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit which is given to us in such sayings it is imphed that he who loves god must do what god has commanded that his love depends upon his doing and so he must love his neighbour also because this is what god has commanded sometimes scripture men tions only the love of neighbour bear ye one another’s bur dens and so shall ye fulfil the law of christ the whole law is fulfilled in one saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour ps 1 1 5 2 the will that men live righteously includes the approval of righteous living where it is present 21 rom 8 28 23 rom 5.5 22 i cor 8 3 24 gal 62 the trinity 51 as thyself 25 qr as in the gospel whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you even so do unto them for this is the law and the prophets there are many other places in holy writ where it seems that the love of neighbour is alone en joined for our perfecting and nothing is said of the love of god though the law and the prophets hang upon both command ments the reason for this is that he who loves his neighbour must necessarily have first the love for love itself 27 but god is love and he who abideth in love abideth in god 28 it follows that he must have first the love of god 1 1 those who seek god by way of the spiritual powers 29 set over the world or its parts drift far away from him separated not by space but by difference of affection they strive towards the external and desert what lies within them though god is more inward than the innermost they may have heard or con ceived of some holy celestial power but what draws them is the admiration that human weakness feels for the works of such a power rather than the model of reverent submission which attains to the rest of god they choose rather the pride of angelic potency than the devotion of angelic being no holy person rejoices in his own power but in the power of him from whom is derived all potency for fitting action he knows that it is a mightier thing to be united in willing worship to the omnipotent than to display in his own power and will a potency which is fearful to those who have it not so when the lord jesus christ himself wrought miracles he sought to convey to those who marvelled a fuller truth to turn them from their absorption in temporal portents to things inward and eternal come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will refresh you take my yoke upon you he does not say learn of me for i raise up them that have been dead four days but learn of me for i am meek and lowly of heart the firm ground of humility is stronger and safer than any windy elevation so he goes on and ye shall find rest for your souls for love is not puffed up god is love the faithful in love shall rest in him called back from the noisy outer world to the joyful silences 25 gal 5.14 matt 7 12 27 that love in action implies the love of love i.e the will to love is axiomatic for augustine 28 i john 416 29 augustine is thinking of the worshippmg of angels condemned by paul in col 2 16 which he extends to cover heathenism generally 20 matt 1 1 28 f i cor 13 4 i john 4 8 wisdom 3 9 augustine later works 52 god is love why should we go speeding to the height of heaven and the nethermost parts of the earth seeking for him who is with us if we would but be with him 12 viii let none say i do not know what i am to love let him love his brother and he will love that same love he knows the love whereby he loves better than the brother whom he loves god can be more known to him than his brother really more known because more present more known because more in ward more known because more sure embrace the love that is god through love embrace god he is the very love that links together in holy bond all good angels and all god’s ser vants and unites them and us to one another and in obedience to himself the more we are clean from the cancer of pride the more are we filled with love and he who is filled with love is filled with god but now you will say charity indeed i see i fix my mind’s eye upon it as best i may i believe the word of scripture that god is charity and he that abideth in charity abideth in god 3 2 but my vision of charity is not a vision of the trinity well let me try to make you see that it is trusting that charity itself be present to move us to a good end the charity that we love is a loving charity and it is because it loves that we love it what then is the object of charity’s love which makes charity itself lovable if it loves nothing it is not charity if it loves itself it cannot love itself as chanty unless itself have some object a transitive word denotes itself as well as connotes its object but it does not denote itself as transitive word unless it denotes itself as connoting an object similarly charity may love itself but only if it love itself as having an object of its love will it be loving itself as charity the object of charity’s love must be something which charity makes us love and that if we are to start from what is nearest is our brother remember the apostle john’s commendation of brotherly love whosoever loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is no cause of stumbling in him 33 evidently he has set the perfection of righteousness in the love of brother he in whom there is no cause of stumbling is plainly perfect yet he seems to have said nothing of the love of god the only explanation of that is that he means god to be comprehended in brotherly love itself and a little later in the epistle he says explicitly beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not hath not known god for 32 i john 4.16 33 i john 2 10 the trinity 53 god is love 4 xhe train of thought makes it clear enough that this same brotherly love the love wherewith we love another is being proclaimed with apostolic authority to be not only of god but god it is god then that causes us to love our brother when love causes us to do so and the first object of our love must needs be that very love wherewith we love our brother we infer from this that the two commandments cannot be separated god is love he who loves love assuredly loves god he who loves his brother must necessarily love love so we read soon after he that loveth not his brother whom he sees cannot love god whom he seeth not the reason of his not seeing god is that he does not love his brother he who does not love his brother is not in love and he who is not in love is not in god for god is love again he who is not in god is not in the light for god is light and there is no darkness in him naturally then he who is not in the light does not see the light which means that he does not see god because he is in darkness he sees his brother with the outward human vision to which god is invisible but if he loved with spiritual charity the brother whom his outward vision sees he would see god who is charity itself with the inward vision whereby god can be seen thus he who loves not the brother whom he sees cannot love god whom he does not see just because god is the love which he lacks we need not be disturbed by the question how much charity ought we to give to our brother and how much to god the answer is to god incomparably more than to ourselves and to our brother as much as to ourselves ourselves we love the more the more we love god it is then out of one and the same charity that we love god and our neighbour but we love god for god’s sake and for god’s sake ourselves and our neighbour 13 ix what is it i would ask that kindles the fire in our hearts when we hear or read such words as these behold now is the acceptable time behold now is the day of salvation giving no occasion of stumbling in anything that our ministra tion be not blamed but in everything commending ourselves as god’s ministers in much patience in affiictions in necessities in distresses in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labours in watchings in fastings in pureness in knowledge in long suffering in kindness in the holy ghost in charity unfeigned in the word of truth in the power of god by the armour of 34 i john 4 7 f 35 1 john 4 20 36 i john i 5 augustine later works 54 righteousness on the right hand and on the left by glory and dishonour by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always re joicing as poor yet making many rich as having notliing and yet possessing all things if the love of paul the apostle is kindled in us at this reading surely it is because we believe that his life was like that but that god’s ministers ought so to live is not a thing we believe on hearsay it is what we see within ourselves or rather above ourselves in very truth the paul whom we believe so to have lived we love because of what we see and were it not that above all we loved that pattern which we perceive in everlasting fixity and changelessness we should not love the apostle because we retain the faith that his life in the flesh was correspondent and accordant to that pat tern yet we find that we are somehow stirred more largely to love of the pattern itself through the faith by which we believe that a man has lived in accord with it and by the hope which forbids us since there have been men who so lived to despair of ourselves who are men like them being able to live like them so that we desire it more ardently and pray for it more con fidently what makes us love their life is the love of that pattern according to which we believe they lived and their life when we believe it stirs m us towards the same pattern a more burn ing charity so that the stronger burns our love for god the more sure and unclouded is our vision of him because in god we behold the changeless pattern of righteousness in accord with which we make our judgment that a man should live faith then avails for the knowledge and the love of god not as though he were wholly unknown or wholly unloved before but that he may be known more clearly and loved more stead fastly 14 x now the charity praised and preached with such energy by divine scripture what is it but love of the good love is the activity of a lover and it has a certain object there then we have three things the lover that which is loved and love 3 8 love itself is nothing but a land of life which couples together or seeks to couple some two entities the lover and the 37 11 cor 6 2 ff 38 augustine thus fulfils his undertaking i i vii above to display a trinity in love but immediately warns the reader that this trinity is not what we seek the reason being that the loved object is something external to the lover it is worth noting how small a place this particular analogy occupies m his thought the trinity 55 loved this is so in the carnal loves of the external world but let us leave the flesh beneath our feet and rise to the soul where we may drink of a purer and more limpid spring what does any friend love in his friend but the soul there too are the three the lover the loved and love a further ascent still re mains for us a higher realm in which our search is to be pur sued so far as men may but here we may pause not supposing we have found what we seek but having found as seekers do the place in which to look we have found not the thing itself but where it is to be sought and that will suffice to give us a point from which a fresh start may be undertaken book ix the trinity of mind knowledge and love argument we begin by considering the triad of love lover and beloved on the human level for man is at least an image of god but the human mind loves itself then subject and object coincide and we have two entities instead of three the mind and its love two as related to one another but together one as a spiritual reality 2 so far there is no trinity but self love implies self knowledge and once more we have three entities the mind its love and its knowledge in their perfect or ideal condition corresponding to one another in an absolute co equality 3 4 self know ledge and self love are not properties attributable to the mind as subject but themselves substantive realities though not independent since essentially relative to one another 5 6 nor are they parts of a whole or elements in a mixture they are of one and the same substance reciprocally inherent 7.8 we must distinguish however between the individual human mind as self known and self loved which is no immutable reality and the ideal form or pattern of mind which we recog nize and approve in the light of truth 9 1 1 true know ledge may be regarded as a word conceived from our vision of truth and as it were begotten by inward speech 12 all our judgments of value true or false involve the production of such a word which owes its conception to love and its bringing forth to the conscious act of approval 13 14 word may thus be defined as knowledge love 15 since all knowledge must exhibit a correspondence or likeness to its object the mental word is also appropriately called an image 16 love on the other hand is not begotten of 56 the trinity 57 the mind 17 as is the mind’s knowledge of itself for this knowledge is a discovery which presumes a search and love is the motive of the seeking 18 the text i i the object of our present enquiry is trinity not a trinity but the trinity which is god the true supreme and only god the reader then must be patient we are stiu en quiring and such enquiry deserves no censure provided that our search for what must baffle knowledge and expression be made in unshaken faith affirmation indeed calls at once and rightly for censure from any who may see and instruct to better purpose seek god and your soul shall live but we are warned against all premature conceit of apprehension seek his face alway 2 if any man says paul thinketh that he knoweth anything he knoweth not yet how he ought to know but whosoever loveth god he is known of him he does not say hath known him which would be dangerous presump tion but is known of him so elsewhere after saying now that ye have known god he at once corrects himself rather are known of god and most emphatic is that other passage brethren i count not myself to have apprehended only for getting that which is behind and reaching out to those things which are before i am intent to follow after the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded by perfection in this life he understands nothing but to forget the things which are behind and to reach out intently after the things which are before the safest intention is that of seeking continually until the goal of all our effort and our reaching out be attained the intent is rightly directed only if it set out from faith a sure faith is itself a beginning of knowledge but sure knowledge will not be per fected till after this life when we shall see face to face let us then be thus minded convinced that the temper of the truth seeker is safer than that of rashly taking the unknown for known let us seek as expecting to find and let us find as expecting still to seek for when a man hath done then he beginneth let us shun all doubt concerning matters of faith let us refuse all hasty affirmation concerning matters of understanding in 1 ps 69 32 21 ps 105 4 3 i cor 8 2 f gal 4 9 5 phil 3 13 ff 6 i cor 13u2 ecclesiasticus 18 7 58 augustine later works the one holding to authority in the other seeking out the truth as for our present enquiry let us believe that father son and holy spirit are one god maker and ruler of the whole creation that father is not son nor holy spirit father or son but a trinity of mutually related persons and a unity of equal essence and let us seek to understand this truth praying for the help of him whom we would understand and desiring to set forth what we understand as he shall enable us with such care ful reverence as to speak nothing unworthily even if we some times speak mistakenly let us endeavour for example that if we say of the father what properly does not belong to him it may belong to the son or to the holy spirit or to the whole trinity that if we say something of the son which does not properly apply to the son it may at leeist apply to the father or to the holy spirit or to the whole trinity that if we say of the holy spirit what does not in strict propriety befit him yet it be not foreign to the father or to the son or to the one god which is the tnnity itself we may desire to see whether the holy spirit be properly that most excellent gift of charity if he is not then either the father is charity or the son or the whole trinity since we may not oppose the certainty of faith and most mighty authority of the scripture which says god is charily but we must never let the error of impiety so lead us astray that we speak of the trinity that which belongs not to creator but creature or else is a product of vain imagining 2 ii in view of all this let us consider those three things to which our enquiry has brought us we are not yet concerned with things in heaven not yet with god father son and holy spirit but with this image inferior but still an image which is man so much more familiar and less difficult for the infirmity of our mind to study i the enquirer present in my love for anything three things myself what i love and love itself love itself if i love it must have its object for there is no love where nothing is loved lover the loved and love these are three but suppose my love’s object be myself then the three become two the object of love and love for when the lover loves himself subject and object are the same just as loving and being loved are in the love of self the same thing there is no difference between the statements he loves himseff and he is loved by himself in that case to love and to be loved are not two things 8 this question is not taken up for detailed consideration until book xv 27 xvii the trinity 59 any more than are the lover and the beloved two persons but still the love and its object remain two for self love is not love unless the love itself be loved and to love oneself and to love one’s love are not the same thing since as we have said love which is loved must already have its object else it is no love in self love then there are two things present love and what is loved the lover and the loved being one from which it appears that a triad is not necessarily impked in the existence of love let us abstract from our present consideration all the other elements of which human nature is composed and in order to find what we are looking for in as clear a form as the matter permits let us take the mind in isolation in the mind’s love for itself two things are displayed mind and love self love is the will to be at one’s own disposal for self enjoyment if the mind wills to be no more and no less than what it is then will corresponds to mind and love is equal to lover lo if love is a really existing thing it is not body but spirit the same is true of the mind yet the mind and its love are not two spirits or two essences idut one though this one thing is somehow two lover and love or if you prefer to put it so love and love’s object and these two are mutually related terms lover being related to love and love to lover for it is by love that the lover loves and love is the activity of a loving person mind and spirit on the other hand are not relative terms but denote the essence in itself the mind and spirit are not what they are be cause they belong to a particular man the term man con notes body but if we abstract the body mind and spirit remain whereas i we abstract the lover there is no love and if we abstract the love there is no lover thus as mutually related terms they are two in themselves each is spirit and both together are one spirit each is mind and both together are one mind where then is there a trimty let us apply all our powers to the question invoking the everlasting light to illuminate our darkness that we may see in ourselves as may be permitted to us the image of god 3 iii the mind cannot love itself unless it also knows itself that it should love what it does not know is impossible it would be folly to allege that the mind forms a general con cept from its experience of other minds and believes itself to belong to the same class of being how can a mind not knowing 5 see viii 10 vii n love as a relation remains a distinguishable reality even when the subject and object related comcide 10 this pomt is developed in 4 below augustine later works 6o itself know any other mind it cannot be compared with the body’s eye which sees other eyes but not itself we see bodies with the bodily eyes because the rays which flash from them and touch the thing seen cannot be reflected back upon the eyes unless we are looking at a mirror this is a very delicate and obscure subject which needs much research before it can be clearly proved to be so or otherwise but whatever be the truth about our power of vision the power itself whether it acts by rays or in some other way is something that we cannot see with our eyes we enquire about it with the mind and com prehend it if we can with the mind we may say then that the mind acquires knowledge of corporeal things by the bodily senses and of things incorporeal by itself being itself incor poreal it must know itself by itself if it does not know itself it cannot love itself 4 iv now just as we found a duality of mind and its love in the fact of self love so there is a duality of mind and its know ledge in the fact of self knowledge accordingly the mind its love and its knowledge constitute a triad these three are one and if perfect they are equal if the mind’s love of itself does not reach the measure of its being if say the human mind which is greater than the body loves itself only with the love due to the human body then there is sin the love is not perfect again if the measure of its self love exceeds that of its being if it should love itself with the love due to god to whom it is incomparably inferior then also there is great sin and no perfect self love the sin is yet more perverse and iniquitous when the body is loved with love due to god similarly a know ledge which falls short of its object where full knowledge is possible is not perfect a knowledge which is greater than its object implies a superiority in the nature of the knower to that of the known the knowledge of a body is greater than the body which is the object of the knowledge for knowledge is a mode of hfe in the knowing mind whereas the body is not life and any life is greater not in extent but in power than any body but when the mind knows itself the knowledge does not exceed the self for the self is both subject and object of the knowledge if it knows the whole of itself without any alien importation 12 11 the theory of vision propounded in plato’s timaeus according to which rays proceed from the eyes and mingle with light in the atmosphere was rejected by aristotle 12 the error resulting from alien importation is discussed in book x 7 v ff the trinity 6l the knowing is correspondent to the mind for it is no less apparent that in this self knowledge the knowing is not de pendent on any other source and when this knowledge takes in the whole self and nothing more it is neither lesser nor greater than the self thus it is true to say that when each member of our triad is perfect it follows that all three are equal 5 at the same time we find ourselves encouraged to con ceive how this triad really exists in the soul inseparable though distinct to consciousness as so many substantive or essential realities not as properties of a subject like colour or shape in a body or any other quality or quantity for nothing of that kind can pass outside the subject to which it belongs the colour or shape of a particular body cannot belong also to another but the love whereby the mind loves itself can be directed to an object outside itself the mind knows not only itself but much else as well therefore love and knowledge do not belong to the mind as attributes to a subject their existence is as sub stantive as that of the mind itself they can be regarded as mutually related terms but each exists in a substance of its own as related terms they are not comparable to colour and the coloured subject where the colour possesses no substance proper to itself the substance is the coloured body the colour is in the substance the relation is to be compared rather to that of two friends who are also men that is substances men is not a relative term friends is 6 lover knower knowledge love are all sub stances but while lover and love knower and know ledge are at the same time like friends related terms mind and spirit are relative no more than are men yet it is not the case with lover and love knower and knowledge as it is with men who are friends that they can exist apart from one another it may appear that friends qud friends can be separated in body only and not in soul but it is possible for a friend to begin to hate his friend and thereby cease to be his friend though the other may not know it and continue to love him on the other hand if the love with which the mind loves itself ceases to exist the mind will also cease to be lover and so with the knowledge whereby the mind knows itself a head is a head and it and that which is headed are related terms though also substances both being bodies and if there be no head the thing will not be headed but in this case severance can separate the two from one another which is not so with love and lover or knowledge and knower augustine later works 62 7 if any bodies exist which cannot be cut or divided at all they must still bp composed of their own parts or they would not be bodies part and whole are related terms since every part be longs to some whole and the whole is whole by a totality of parts but since both part and whole are bodies they exist not only as related but as substances may we say then that the mind is a whole and that the love with which it loves itself and the knowledge with which it knows itself are like two parts composing the whole or alternatively that they and the mind itself are those equal parts making up the one whole the diffi culty here is that no part embraces the whole to which it be longs whereas the mind’s knowledge when it knows itself as a whole that is perfectly extends over the whole of it and when it loves itself perfectly it loves itself as a whole and its love ex tends over the whole of it take another possible comparison a single drink may be composed of wine water and honey each component will extend throughout the whole and yet they remain three there is no part of the drink which does not contain all three not side by side as would be oil and water but completely mixed all are substances and the whole fluid is one definite substance made out of the three can we suppose that mind love and knowledge exist together in the same kind of way apparently not water wine and honey are not them selves of one substance though one single substance of drink results from that mixture but it seems certain that our mental triad must be of one and the same substance since the mind loves itself and knows itself and its threeness does not involve its being loved or known by anything else the three must then necessarily have one and the same essence and if they were intermingled they would not be three nor capable of mutual relation three similar rings for example might be made out of one piece of gold they might be linked together but would still be mutually related as being alike and all like ness being a relation we should have a trinity of rings and all one gold but if they were melted down and mixed with one another in a single lump there would be an end to the trinity we could still speak as with the three rings of one gold but no longer of three golden objects 8 v in our triad on the other hand in which the mind knows and loves itself we have a permanent trinity of mind love and knowledge there is no loss of identity in mixture though severally each is in itself and mutually each as a whole is in the others as wholes whether each singly in the other pair the trinity 63 r the pairs in each singly in other words all are in ail the nind is in itself being a substantive term though it is termed mowing known or knowable in relation to its knowledge and oving loved or lovable in relation to the love with which it oves itself knowledge is indeed related to the mind knowing r known but still it is properly termed known and knowing in tself for the knowledge by which the mind knows itself is not inknown to the knowledge itself similarly love though related o the loving mind to which it belongs still remains of itself and n itself for love is loved and that can only be by the love which s itself this shows that each of the three singly is in itself vgain they are alternately in one another the loving mind is in he love love is in the lover’s knowledge knowledge in the mowing mind they are severally in the remaining pairs the nind which knows and loves itself is in its love and knowledge he love of the loving and self knowing mind is in the mind and ts knowledge the knowledge of the self knowing and loving nind is in tlie mind and its love because it loves its knowledge lnd knows its love the three pairs are in each single member or the mind which knows and loves itself is in the love together vith its knowledge and in the knowledge together with the ove and the love and the knowledge are together in the mind vhich loves and knows itself and the manner in which wholes tre in wholes we have already indicated the mind loving and mowing the whole of itself knowing the whole of its love and oving the whole of its knowledge whenever the three members ire each in themselves perfect in a wonderful way the three ire inseparable from one another and yet each one of them is l substance and all together are one substance or essence hough mutually related to one another 9 vi but the object of the human mind’s self knowledge md self love is not something changeless any individual man nay upon introspection speak his own mind in one way by observing what takes place in himself but give a definition of he human mind according to genus or species in a different vray thus when he speaks of his own mind and tells me whether he understands something or not whether he wishes omething or not i believe him but when he gives a true de inition of the human mind by species or genus i recognize and onfirm the truth this shows that what the individual sees in dmself which his neighbour may believe without seeing upon ds word is not the same as what he sees in very truth which his leighbour may contemplate also the one changes in process 64 augustine later works of time while the other stands fast in a changeless eternity it is not that we see many minds with the bodily eye and so by comparison put together a knowledge of the human mind according to genus and species no we contemplate that im perishable truth from which we derive our more or less ade quate definition not of that which the mind of any individual man w but of that which in the everlasting order it ought to be 10 even with regard to the images of material things ac quired through the senses and imprinted in the memory mak ing it possible for the mind to form imaginary pictures of things not seen which will either differ from the actual originals or display a chance correspondence with them we must admit that our judgments of approval or disapproval of these images if rightly made are based upon quite other standards which in their changeless existence transcend our own minds whether i recall the walls of carthage which i have seen or picture those of alexandria which i have not i distinguish between the dif ferent images which present themselves and my preference of one to another is a rational preference there is a higher judg ment of truth strong and clear based in its own right on its inviolate standards it may be partly covered by the cloud of material images but it remains itself uninvolved and unconfounded 11 but much will depend on whether i am shut off from the transparent heaven beneath or within this fog of obscurity or whether i stand as on a mountain top in the open air between looking up to the unclouded light above me and down upon the thick mists below whence comes it that the warmth of brotherly love is kindled in me when i hear of some man who has endured the sharpest torments in steady and undisfigured faith point out to me the man himself and i am eager to meet him and know him to be bound in friendship with him if opportunity offers i approach and greet him i talk with him i put my feeling for him into such words as i can i want him in return to have and to express such a feeling towards me and i strive for an embrace of spirit in faith and trust since i cannot all at once find my way to a thorough discernment of his inmost heart and so i love him as a brave and faithful man with a love pure and true but suppose that as we talk he admits or shows by some unconsidered remark that even his faith is not what it should be that he seeks in god for some material bene fit and has borne his sufferings in that false hope whether in the desire of monetary reward or m the vain lust for human the trinity 65 praise at once the love which carried me towards him falls back rebuffed it removes itself from the man’s unworthiness and remains in the unchanging pattern which had made me love him when i believed him worthy if i do still love him it is that he may become such as i have found him not to be in him nothing has changed though change is possible and he may yet become what i had believed him in my mind there has been a change in my estimate of him which is no longer what it was and my love has been diverted at the bidding of supreme and changeless right from a purpose of enjoyment to a purpose of amendment but the pattern of truth unshaken and stead fast by which in the belief of his goodness i might have enjoyed his friendship and by which i now seek his amendment this pattern still sheds the constant and eternal light of pure and incorruptible reason upon my mind’s gaze and upon that cloud of imaginings to which i look down from the mountain when i reflect upon the man i saw in the same way i may recall to my mind some finely pro portioned arch which i have seen say at carthage then an object conveyed to the mind by ocular report and imparted to the memory is the cause of my imaged vision but my mind’s eye sees something else which is the ground of my approval for the work of art and which would enable me if i disapproved to correct it we pass judgment on this in accordance with that other and that other pattern is object of the rational mind’s contemplation we may be in contact with things present through the senses we may retain images of things absent in the memory we may use such images to form pictures which we could realize in actual construction if we had the will or the ability but it is in one way that we frame our mental images of bodies or perceive bodies with the bodily sense it is in another that we apprehend with the grasp of intuition the principles of art embodied in such forms and transcending the mind’s vision 12 vii thus in that realm of eternal truth from which all things temporal were made we behold with our mind’s eye the pattern upon which our being is ordered and which rules all to which we give effect with truth and reason in ourselves or in the outer world thence we conceive a truthful knowledge of things which we have within us as a kind of word begotten by an inward speech and remaining with us after its birth when we speak to others we apply the service of our voice or of some material sign to this indwelling word in order that by means 66 augustine later works of a perceptible prompting there may take place in the hearer’s mind something like what remains in the mind of the speaker there is nothing that we effect through the body by act or speech involving judgments of ethical value that is not preceded by the utterance of such an inner word no one does anything deliberately that he has not previously spoken in his heart 13 and this word owes its conception to love whether it be the love of the creature or of the creator of that which is by nature changeable or of the changeless truth the word is con ceived that is either by covetousness or by charity i do not mean that the creature should not be loved but a love of the creature if it be referred to the creator becomes charity and not covetousness it is covetousness when the creature is loved for its own sake and then it serves not to aid our use but to corrupt our enjoyment the creature is either equal or inferior to ourselves the inferior is to be used in relation to god the equal is to be enjoyed but only in god as you ought to enjoy yourself not in yourself but in him who made you so you should enjoy him whom you love as yourself thus we are to enjoy ourselves and our brothers in the lord not daring to let our selves sink downwards into our own keeping 3 the word is born when we approve the product of our thought either for sinning or for doing right and this word of ours and the mind of which it is begotten are united by the middle term of love which binds itself to them as a third member in a spiritual embrace without any confusion 14 ix conception and birth of the word coincide when the will comes to rest in the knowledge itself as happens in the love of things spiritual the man for example whose know ledge and love of righteousness are perfect is thereby righteous even though there be no occasion for an outward and bodily act displaying it in the love of things carnal and temporal on the other hand the conception of the word and its bringing forth like the conception and bringing forth of animals are two 13 this paragraph summarizes the central principle of augustinian ethics viz the distinction between use and enjoyment which is worked out in the first book of the de doctnna christiana the final end of man’s existence is the enjoyment of god which consists in union with him through knowledge and love nevertheless our love of one another is not merely a means to the love of god the love of neighbour is a love of enjoyment not of use for in the love of god the love of neigh bour is necessarily included or contained the peace of the heavenly city is a fellowship of perfect order and harmony m the enjoyment of god and of one another in god de civ xix 13 the trinity 67 different things here what is conceived by desire is born by acquisition avarice is not satisfied by the knowledge and love of gold without its possession sensuality or ambition require not only the knowledge and love of eating and drinking and sexual intercourse of dignities and powers but their exercise yet all such things will fail to satisfy even when possessed he that drinketh of this water shall thirst again or as the psalm has it he hath conceived sorrow and brought forth in iquity 1 that is sorrow or toil is conceived in the conception of that which it is not enough to know and love so that the soul is sick and fevered with need until it attains them brings them forth our latin words for gains parta or finds reperta comperta appropriately suggest derivation from bring ing forth partus covetousness when it hath conceived bringeth forth sin so the lord cries aloud gome unto me all that travail and are burdened and again woe unto them that are with child or give suck in those days every good deed or sin is related to this bringing forth of the word in the saying from thy mouth thou shalt be justified and from thy mou thou shalt be condemned where mouth sig nifies not the one we see but the invisible inward mouth of thought and heart 15 x the question properly arises whether all knowledge is word or only the knowledge which is loved we know also what we hate but we should not speak of the mind’s con ceiving or bringing forth that in which we take no pleasure not all that affects us in any way is conceived some things which are known only are not to be called words and with these we are now concerned we must distinguish three senses of word first the word temporally extended in syllables whether spoken aloud or only thought second anything known and fixed in the mind so long as memory retains it for produc tion and definition though the thing itself be displeasing third that in the mental conception of which we take pleasure in this last sense of word we understand the apostle’s saying no man saith jtsus is lord but in the holy spirit 1 whereas we learn that others may say the same thing but in another sense from the lord’s own words not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven 20 yet we should note that when it is right for us to take no pleasure in anything that we hate and to disapprove it our disapproval 14 john 4 13 15 ps 7 14 15 james 1.15 i 7 matt ii’iss 24 19 18 matt 12 37 1 i cor 12 3 20 matt 7 21 68 augustine later works itself is approved pleases and is a word it is not the know ledge of faults that displeases us but the faults themselves it pleases me that i know and can define the meaning of intem perance and that constitutes its word so in any art or skill there are known faults of which the knowledge is rightly approved the connoisseur discerns the appearance and the lack of a particular excellence and can affirm or deny its pre sence but the lack of the excellence and the liability to the fault are properly condemned to define intemperance to utter its word belongs to the art of morals to be intemperate belongs to that which the same art censures again it belongs to the art of speech to know and define a solecism but to com mit one is a fault to which the same art attaches blame the purpose of this discussion has been to suggest that what makes a word is knowledge together with love thus when the mind knows and loves itself its word is united to it by love and since it loves the knowledge and knows the love the word is in the love and the love in the word and both are in the mind that loves and speaks i6 xi now all knowledge that deals with a positive object is like the thing it knows there is another knowledge dealing with negations or defects which we express in the form of disapproval the disapproval of the defect is commendation of the positive object and therefore is itself approved the mind therefore will possess a certain like ness to the object known whether this object pleases or its absence displeases and accordingly so far as we know god we are like him though not of course to the degree of equality since our knowledge of him is not equal to his knowledge of himself when sense perception makes us acquainted with bodies a likeness of them appears in our mind which is the memory image it is not the bodies themselves which are in our mind when we think of them but their likenesses if we accept one for the other we are mistaken to take one thing for another is precisely to mistake and yet the imaging of a body in the mind is of higher value than the bodily object itself in so far as the former exists in a higher being namely a vital substance such as the mind so it is with our knowledge of god we are indeed raised to a higher goodness than we had before we knew him when that knowledge is delighted in and loved as it de serves it becomes a word and effects in us a certain likeness to god yet it is an inferior likeness as existing in an inferior being the soul is creature god creator we conclude that when the mind knows and approves itself the knowledge as the the trinity 69 mind’s word is entirely and constantly correspondent and adequate to the mind being knowledge neither of a lower essence like the body nor of a higher lihe god and while all knowledge has a likeness to its object that is to the thing known the likeness in this knowledge by which the knowing mind is known to itself is perfect and adequate accordingly it is both image and word being moulded upon the mind to which in the act of knowing it is equated and ae thing begotten is equal to the begetter 17 xii we turn now to love and ask whether it too is not image word or offspring if the mind begets its knowledge in knowing itself why should it not beget its love in loving itself if because it is knowable it is the cause of its own knowing it should be the cause of its own love because it is lovable it be comes hard to say why it should not be the begetter of both in our thought of the supreme trinity god the omnipotent creator in whose image man was made this is a question apt to perplex men who are called to faith in god’s truth by way of human modes of speech why may we not believe or under stand the holy spirit also to be begotten of god the father and to be nameable as his son what we are now endeavouring is to pursue this problem as best we may in the human mind from the study of this inferior image where we can look for answer to our questioning from the nature we know as our own the mind’s eye may acquire the keenness which it needs if we are to lift it from the illumined creature towards the changeless light it may be that truth itself will convince us that even as no christian doubts the word of god to be his son so the spirit is charity let us then return to that creaturely image which is the rational mind and address ourselves to it with a closer questioning we find here arising in time a knowledge of certain things unknown before and a love of some things which were not loved before and this may put us in the way of a clearer account since for a discourse which must move in time from point to point a subject which belongs itself to the temporal order is the easier to expound 18 and first it should be plain that a thing can well be knowable a possible object of knowledge and yet be unknown while it is impossible for that which was not already knowable to be known clearly then we must hold that everything we come to know begets in us the knowledge of itself the know ledge is offspring of both the knower and the thing known so that in knowing itself the mind is sole parent of its knowledge 70 augustine later works being itself both known and knower before it knew itself it was knowable to itself but the knowledge of self was not at that time contained in it in coming to know itself it begets a self knowledge which is equal or adequate to itself for the extent of its knowledge is not less than its being and the knowledge is not other in essence the mind itself constituting as we have said both subject and object of the knowledge we come back then to our question about love why should not the mind in loving itself be said similarly to have begotten its self love before loving itself it was lovable to itself having the capacity of self love just as before knowing itself it was knowable to itself having the capacity of self knowledge otherwise it could never have acquired either self knowledge or self love why then may we not say that by the act of self love it has begotten its love exactly as by the act of self knowledge it has begotten its knowledge the answer may be that the source of the love must plainly be that from which it proceeds and that is the mind itself which is self lovable before it is self loving and thus is source of the love by which it loves itself but that there is good reason for not calling this love begotten of the mind like the knowledge by which it knows itself because knowledge is a thing discovered and the discovery is often preceded by a search which aims at resting in its object search is a striving for discovery which is the same thing as finding and things found are as it were brought forth we remember the connection between the latin words arto and repertus and so comparable with an off spring the bringing forth can only be in the knowledge itself where they are as we may say shaped and formed the actual things we seek and find already existed but the knowledge did not and the knowledge is the offspring which we count as being born on the other hand the striving which appears in the search proceeds from the seeker remaining in a kind of suspense and only coming to rest in the desired end when the object sought is found and coupled to the seeker this striving or search may seem a different thing from the love by which the thing known is loved inasmuch as the knowledge sought is yet to be realized none the less it is something of the same kind it can really be described as will for everyone who seeks is willing to find and if what is sought is matter of know ledge then every one who seeks is willing to know if the will is eager and earnest we call it diligence especially as applied to the pursuit and acquisition of the various branches of learning the trinity 71 accordingly we may say that the mind’s bringing forth is preceded by a kind of striving by which in the seeking and finding of what we desire to know knowledge is bom as off spring it follows that this striving whereby knowledge is con ceived and brought forth cannot properly be called brought forth or offspring this same striving or eager pursuit of the thing yet to be known becomes love of the thing known when it holds in its embrace the offspring the knowledge in which it delights and joins it to the begetter here then is a kind of image of the trinity the mind itself its knowledge which is at once its offspring and self derived word and thirdly love these three are one and one single substance the mind is no greater than its offspring when its self knowledge is equal to its being nor than its love when its self love is equal to its knowledge and to its being book x the realization of self knowledge memory understandings will argument the notion of love as a search raises the question whether it is possible to love what is not known in all pursuit of knowledge there is love i the student e.g of languages already knows the value of linguistic knowledge in general his love is directed to an ideal present to his mind he seeks to know the unknown for the sake of something that he knows already 2 4 but though we can in this way understand the search for knowledge of other things such explanation is not applicable to the mind’s search for knowledge of itself in desiring and seeking self knowledge the mind cannot be entirely ignorant of itself 5 yet there are serious objections to any idea that the mind can either know or be known in part 6 it is best to take the maxim know thyself as an injunction to reflect upon our own nature and to accept in practice our real status under god over the material world we are un consciously assimilated to what we love and love of the material causes the mind to conceive itself as material 7 8 hence the various materialist theories of the mind’s nature 9 10 we can know ourselves only by freeing ourselves from all such theories which have no immediate self evidence 11,12 and confin ing our beliefs to the immediate deliveries of consciousness the indubitable facts of our mental and volitional life 13 16 among these we find in memory understanding and will a triad of certainties with regard to the nature of the mind 17 they present a single substantial reality in differing relations to itself and they correspond co equally and completely to one another 18 in the following book we shall try to illustrate their relations by a study of the temporal processes of sense perception 19 72 the trinity 73 the text i i we must now attempt a keener analysis in order to achieve a clear and connected view of the matter we have been discussing in the first place we note that it is quite impossible to love anything which is entirely unknown this requires us to observe carefully the nature of the love involved in any diligent study i mean the love of one who does not yet know but desires to know a particular subject in matters to which we do not customarily apply the word study a love will arise from what is heard the report of a thing of beauty will arouse in the mind the desire to see and enjoy we have a general knowledge of physical beauty drawn from a number of instances previously seen and so we have in our mind a standard of valuation for the external object of our interest in this case the love aroused is not for something completely unknown since we have a know ledge of the kind of thing again our love of a good man whose face we have not seen is based on a knowledge of the virtues which truth itself has given us in the pursuit of knowledge of the various branches of learning it is generally the authority of some eulogizer or professor that sets us going yet if we had not already in our mind a summary impression of the lesiming con cerned we could feel no ardour for its acquisition no one for example would devote care and trouble to the study of rhetoric if he did not know that it was the science of speaking sometimes we may be struck with admiration of the achievements of a science reported or experienced and so be set on acquiring by study die ability to perform them a man ignorant of letters might be told that there is a science by which anyone may be enabled to send words wrought by hand in silence to a recipient at any distance which the latter will apprehend not through the ear but through the eye and he may see the thing done naturally in his desire to know how to do it his zeal will be directed to the purpose which he already knows it is in this way that the learner is stimulated to diligent study for no one can possibly love that of which he is wholly ignorant 2 if you hear an unknown signal such as the sound of a word of whose significance you are ignorant you may want to know what it means what is the object which the sound is used to indicate you hear say the word temtum and because you do not understand it you enquire what it means you must already be aware that it is a signal that it is not a purposeless augustine later works 74 noise but has a certain significance otherwise knowing already the three syllables uttered and having an impression of them formed in your mind by the sense of hearing what further know ledge about it could you require knowing as you do all its letters and sound quantities you are not satisfied because you are simultaneously aware that it is a signal and that arouses your desire to know what it signifies the fuller the knowledge which yet falls short of completeness the greater the mind’s desire for what remains to be known if you were aware only of the existence of the sound but not of its being a signal of some object you would look for nothing more sense perception having already conveyed to you all that was perceptible but since you have learnt that it is not only a sound but a signal you want a complete knowledge of the signal and no signal is completely known without a knowledge of what it signifies an ardent seeker for such knowledge who eagerly pursues his study can hardly be said to have no love what then does he love it is certain that a thing cannot be loved it if is not known in the case supposed what he loves is not the three syllables of which he already has knowledge he may love the known fact that they have a meaning but that is not our present concern for that is not what he seeks to know we are asking what it is that he loves in the object of his study which obviously he does not yet know and the reason for this love is a puzzle to us because we are assured that only things known can be loved the only possible explanation is that in the universe of reason he knows and contemplates the beauty of that learning which embraces the knowledge of all signs or signals and the usefulness of the technique which gives human society the power of inter commumcation for the meetings of men would be no better than absolute solitude if they could not exchange their thoughts in converse the beauty and the use fulness of this ideal is what the soul perceives knows and loves and to enquire about what is unknown in significant sounds is to seek by study for the fuller realization of that ideal in oneself to behold it in the light of truth is not the same as to covet its possession one may behold in the light of truth the greatness and goodness of a universal comprehension and speaking of the languages of all nations so that none would be as the language of a foreigner to any man the worth of such knowledge may be perceived in thought and loved as a thing known the view of it may so inspire the studies of learners that it becomes the centre of their activity and towards it is aimed the trinity 75 all their labour in pursuit of a possession by which they may realize in practice what they have recognized in idea the pos session that is hopefully approached is object of a love so much the more eager and ardent we study with the more energy the sciences which we do not despair of understanding that which a man has no hope of acquiring he will love either feebly or not at all though he may see its beauty accordingly the knowledge of all languages being beyond the hopes of most everyone will give more particular study to that of his own people and though one may feel that a complete knowledge even of that exceeds one’s capacity yet no one is so indolent in the matter as not when he hears an unknown word to want to know its meaning and to enquire into it and learn it if he can the enquiry implies a zeal for learmng and the enquirer appears to be loving a thing unknown to him but it is not so for what touches his soul is the ideal which he knows and meditates from which shines forth the value of a union of minds through the hearing and returning of famihar sounds and that kindles in him the zeal for study in which he will seek for what he does not know but contemplate and love the known ideal to which it appertains let us return to our example if you were asked on your enquiring what the word temetum means how that concerned you you would reply because i might hear someone use the word and not understand him or come across it in reading and be ignorant of the writer’s meaning no one would retort that you must not understand what you hear or know what you read about nearly every rational soul can immediately see the beauty of this acquirement whereby the thoughts of men are made known to one another by the utterance of significant sounds because you know the value of it and love it because you know it you enquire with the interest of a student about the unknown word and when you have heard to your satisfac tion that temetum was an ancient name for wine but in our modern usage has become obsolete you may stiu count it need ful for you to know as a reader of ancient literature or if you have no use for such reading you may think it not worth com mitting to memory since you see that it has no relevance to the known ideal of learning which your mind contemplates and loves 3 we may conclude that the love active in the student mind which wants to know that of which it is ignorant is not the love of something unknown but of something known for the sake of augustine later works 76 which it desires a knowledge not possessed a man may indeed be moved not by anything already known but by mere curiosity carried away simply by the love of getting to know the un known he ought to be distinguished from the student and called rather curious but not even he loves the unknown indeed it would be more appropriate to say that he hates the unknown which in his wish to know everything he would reduce to non existence if the problem be thrown back upon us with the objection that it is no more possible to hate than to love what one does not know we may concede the point but it should be understood that die statement he loves to know the unknown is not equivalent to the statement he loves the unknown it is possible for anyone to love to know the un known but not to love the unknown in the former phrase the words to know are not otiose for it is not the unknown but knowledge itself that is loved by him who loves to know the un known and unless knowledge itself were known one could not say with confidence either that one knew or that one did not not only does the statement i know if it is a true statement involve the knowing what knowledge is but the same is in volved also in the statement i do not know if made con fidently and truly with knowledge of its truth for the speaker must distinguish the ignorant from the knower if looking into his own mind he says truly i do not know and if he knows that he speaks the truth how could that be if he does not know what knowledge is 4 ii to sum up neither the true student nor the curious enquirer loves the unknown even in his most ardent pursuit of the knowledge of what he does not know either i the object of his love is already known to him in kind and he is seeking to know it also in some particular case or cases which he may hear commended though as yet unknown to him his mind will form an image of the thing and that will stir his love but it can only have been formed from what he knew already if he should find the example commended to him unlike the pictured mental image already made familiar by reflection he may have no love for it if he has the love will arise from his acquaintance with it before that what he had loved was something else to which the formative work of the mind had accustomed his imagination if on the other hand he finds the thing spoken of to be like his 1 it must be remembered that throughout this examination of the love involved m diligent study amor studentium love connotes desire it is love as yet unsatisfied see introduction ad fin the trinity 77 picture of it so that he might truly say that he loved it before he saw it that love will still not have been for the unknown for its object will have been known to him in the image or 2 we see something and love it under the ideal form of timeless reason and when we find it expressed in terms of temporal reality led by the testimony of another's experience and so love it we are not as sufficiently argued above loving the unknown or 3 we love something we know for the sake of which we seek for something unknown and then it is by no means love of the unknown that possesses us but of the other known thing to which we know that the knowledge of what we still seek in ignorance is relevant this was illustrated above by the unfamiliar word or lastly 4 the love is for knowledge itself which cannot be unknown to anyone desiring it for these reasons when we wish to know what we are ignorant of and the eager pursuit of our enquiry makes it im possible to deny the presence in it of love it appears as though we were loving the unknown but i think that a careful ob servation must be convinced by my argument that the matter stands otherwise and that nothing at ail is loved if it be un known the examples given however apply only in regard to persons wanting to know things other than themselves we must be prepared for a new aspect of the problem when we look at the mind’s desire for knowledge of itself 5 iii what then is the object of the mind’s love when still unknown to itself it eagerly seeks to know itself there is the fact of the mind’s seeking to know itself and devoting itself with ardour to the study in this there must be love but for what not surely for itself since as yet it is ignorant of itself and no one can love what he does not know let us examine the possibihties i its form may have been described to it by report in the way in which we are told about persons absent in that case what it loves may be not itself but an imaginary picture of itself which may be quite different from what it really is or the picture may be like itself so that in loving the picture it is loving itself before knowing since it contemplates a kkeness of itself it must then have known other minds from which the picture is drawn and so be known to itself generically but why should it have knowledge of other minds and not of itself seeing that nothing can be more immediately present to it than itself to the bodily eyes it is true other eyes are more known than themselves but if the case of the mind is similar it may as well abandon a hopeless quest eyes will never see themselves except 78 augustine later works in mirrors and we cannot conceive of any similar appliance for the contemplation of incorporeal things by which the mind could know itself as in a mirror 2 a second possibility is that it sees in the eternal truth of reason the excellence of self knowledge loves what it sees and studies to realize it in itself though it is not known to itself it knows how good it would be to know itself yet it seems strange indeed that the mind which does not yet know itself should know already the beauty of self knowledge 3 or again it may see a final good its own safety and happiness by means of some hidden memory which has remained with it in all its journeyings afield and it may believe that it can never attain that end unless it know itself so the love of the end may cause it to seek for the means it loves the known end and therefore seeks the unknown means but why should the memory of its happiness have been able to remain with it and not the memory of itself why should it not know the self that wishes to attain the end as well as the end it wishes to attain 4 lastly in loving the knowledge of itself its love may be not for the self which is still unknown but simply for the knowledge it may naturally resent that its own place should be vacant among the objects of that knowledge which it would have to be all embracing it knows what knowledge is and loving what it knows desires also the knowledge of itself how then can it know its knowledge and not know itself it knows that it knows other things and not itself that is what enables it to know what knowledge is but how if it is ignorant of itself can it know itself as having any knowledge it is not some other mind that it knows as knowing but itself therefore it knows itself similarly in its seeking to know itself it knows itself as seeking again therefore it must already have a knowledge of itself it follows that the mind cannot be entirely ignorant of itself since the knowledge of itself as ignorant is to that extent a knowledge of itself if it were ignorant of its ignorance it would not seek for self knowledge and therefore the fact of the seeking proves that it is more known to itself than unknown for in seeking to know itself it knows itself as seeking and as ignorant 6 iv are we then to say that the mind partly knows and partly does not know itself it would be absurd to maintain that the whole mmd does not know what it knows i am not saying that it must know the whole but that whatever it knows the whole of it knows accordingly in any knowledge about itself which must be possessed by the whole mind it knows that the the trinity 79 whole mind is knowing further it knows itself as having some object of its knowledge but any such object must be present to the whole mind therefore it knows the whole of itself again nothing about the mind can be more certainly known to itself than the fact of its being alive it cannot be mind and not be alive though it has intellect over and above hfe whereas the souls of beasts have life without intellect now just as the mind is the whole mind so it is the whole of it that hves but it knows that it is alive therefore it knows the whole of itself finally in seeking to know itself the mind must know that it is a mind otherwise it would not know whether it was really seeking itself and the search might be wrongly directed since for all it knows it may not be a mind and then its search for knowledge of the mind would not be a search for itself thus since it knows that its search for the nature of mind is a search for itself it must necessarily know that it is itself a mind and if it knows no more of itself than that it is a mind and wholly a mind it must know the whole of itself but let us suppose that it does not know that it is a mind but in seeking itself knows only that this is what it is doing if it is ignorant of its own nature it may still mistake the object of its search if such mistake is to be avoided it must certainly know what the object is and if it knows what it is seeking and is in fact seeking itself then it knows itself why then should the search go on suppose it knows itself in part and in part is still seeking then the object of the search is not itself which means itself as a whole but a part of it in that case knowing that the whole of itself is not yet found it must know the extent of the whole it will be seeking what is lacking to its knowledge in the way that we try to recall to our mind what has escaped but not altogether escaped our memory since we can recognize when it comes back to us that this is what we were looking for but here there are two difficulties the notion of the mind’s returning 2 the mss vary between tota se scit the whole of it knows itself and totam se sat it knows the whole of itself augustine has just said that the idea of a knowledge possessed by only part of the mind is absurd what he has to prove is that if the whole mind knows itself it cannot be knowing only a part of itself the first of the two ms readings merely repeats what has already been said while the second begs the question the translation given assumes that the origmal text was totam se sat sare which gives the required step m the argument if the whole mind knows it cannot be unaware of that fact but if it knows itself as wholly possessing an object of knowledge that is as much as to say that it knows itself as a whole 8o augustine later works into the mind seems to imply that the mind can be absent from itself and also we have to say that it is not seeking for the whole of itself having already found a part and yet that the whole mind is seeking it is present to itself as a whole and then nothing remains to be sought for what is lacking is the object not the subject of the seeking thus if the whole mind is seeking itself no part of it can be lacking or if what seeks is not the whole mind but the part already found seeking the part not found then the mind will not be seeking itself since no part of it seeks the same part the part found does not seek itself nor does the part unfound seek itself being the object of search to the part found it would follow since neither the whole mind nor any part of it seeks itself that the mind is not seeking itself at all 7 v what then can be the purport of the injunction know thyself i suppose it is that the mind should reflect upon itself and live in accordance with its nature that is to say strive to be ordered according to its nature under him whom it should be set under and over all that it should stand over under him by whom it ought to be ruled over all that it ought to rule for perverse desire makes it act often as though it had forgotten itself it sees beauties of the inward realm belonging to that transcendent reality which is god its duty is to stand fast for the enjoyment of them but because it would ascribe them to itself and instead of being a derived likeness of god derive from itself the being that is his only it turns away from him loses its stability and sinks into something constantly diminishing in the fancy that it is constantly increasing for neither can it suffice itself nor can aught else suffice it if it withdraw from him who alone suffices through poverty and distress it grows over occupied with its own dealings and the restless pleasures gathered from them and so bent on the ac quisition of knowledge from external things the hke of which it knows and loves and feels that it may lose unless it put forth all its energy to retain them it loses its security and reflects upon itself the less the more secure it imagines itself against the loss of itself 3 the reference is to the famous maxim of greek wisdom attributed to thales and inscribed m apollo’s temple at delphi augustine may be thinking of cicero tusc quaesu i 22 when apollo says know thyself he means know thy soul it was augustine’s own early ideal to know god and the soul sohl i 7 the ideal which he is now attempting to realize the trinity 8l not to know oneself is a different tiling from not thinking of oneself we do not say that a man proficient in many branches of learning is ignorant of grammar when he is not thinking of it because at the moment he is thinking of the art of medicine but though not knowing oneself and not thinking of oneself are different the power of love is such that what the mind has long and lovingly thought over will stick to it hke glue and accom pany it even when it comes back as it were to the thought of itself its love has been devoted to the material things with which the bodily senses have involved it in a persistent familiar ity and because it cannot take with it into the inward realm of immaterial being the material objects themselves it collects and carries along images of them formed in itself and of itself it puts into their malang something of its own substance pre serving a certain power of free judgment upon the form of such images a power which is the peculiar property of mind or rational understanding whose capacity for passing judgment is not lost whereas those parts of the soul which receive impres sions corresponding to material objects we are conscious of sharing with animals 8 vi now the mind goes astray through uniting itself to these images by a love so intense as to make it suppose its own nature to be like theirs it becomes as it were conformed to them not in reality but by supposition supposing itself to be not an image but the actual thing of which it carries the image in itself there remains active in it the power of distinguishing the material and external object from the interior image except when these images so take shape as to give the effect of external impressions instead of internal as happens in dream or mad ness or ecstatic experiences 9 vii thus the mind supposing itself to resemble its own images supposes itself to be a bodily thing it is well aware of its own domination over the body and this has caused men to ask what part of the body has most power in the body and to consider this to be the mind or even the whole soul some have found it in the blood others in the brain others in the heart here the heart is not that of which the scripture speaks i will give thanks to thee o lord with my whole heart or thou shalt love the lord thy god with thy whole heart where the word is used in an altered sense transferred from body to soul this theory identifies the soul with an actual part of the bodily viscera which can be exposed 4 ps 9 1 5 matt 22 37 82 augustine later works by anatomy some have thought that it is composed of minute individual corpuscles which they call atoms colliding and uniting with one another others would make its substance to be air or fire others would not have it to be substantial at all since they could conceive no substance that is not bodily and found no evidence that the soul is a body they imagined it to be no more than the body’s harmony or the resultant of that compound of elements out of which the flesh is constructed all these theories treat the soul as mortal since what is either body or a composition of body cannot endure everlastingly whereas those thinkers who have found its substance in a life that is not corporeal at all life being what animates and vivifies every living body have consistently endeavoured to prove its immortality to the best of their ability arguing that life can never be without life i will not spend time in discussing the notion of the so called fifth body which some writers have devised as origin of the soul in union with the familiar four elements of our world either they mean the same thing by body as we do something extended in space of which any part is less than the whole or else they use the word body for any substance or any changeable substance recognizing that not all substance is spatially extended in three dimen sions in which case we need not quarrel with them over a word 10 if in face of this diversity of opinion one can perceive that the nature of the mind is at the same time substantial and non corporeal that is that it does not occupy a smaller space with a smaller part of itself and a larger space with a larger part one should at the same time observe that the error of supposing it to be corporeal does not arise from ignorance of the mind’s nature but from importing into it qualities supposed essential to any conceivable existence it is supposed that what has to be conceived apart from all corporeal images must be simply non existent but the mind has no need to look for itself as though it were somewhere else there is nothing more im mediately present to cognition than what is present to the mind and there is nothing more immediately present to the mind than 6 these and other greek theories of the soul’s nature are discussed by aristotle in de anima i the allusion which follows to the theories of believers in the soul’s immortality recalls the phaedo of plato where the idea of the soul as a harmony is refuted phaed 85e ff the fifth body seems to refer to aristotle’s notion of the ethereal mattei of which he supposed the stars to be composed the trinity 83 the mind itself the veiy word invention used in the sense of discovery if we think of its derivation suggests that to invent is to come upon what is sought that is why things that come into the mind of their own accord are not usually said to be invented or discovered though they may be called known because we had not been making for them by a process of search so as to come upon them invent them what is sought for with the eyes or any other of the senses is sought by the mind itself for it is the mind that directs the attention of the sense and discovers invents when the sense concerned comes upon what is being sought for in the same way what the mind must know by itself and not through the medium of any bodily sense it discovers when it comes upon its object whether in the higher substance in god or in other parts of the soul as when it passes judgment upon the images of material things coming upon their inward impressions as mediated to the soul by the body ii viii to ask then how the mind is to seek and find itself in what direction it must seek and at what point it will find is to ask a paradoxical question for nothing can be more certainly in the mind than the mind itself but the mind is also in those things upon which it reflects with love and since love has familiarized it with things sensible or corporeal it has no power to be in itself apart from their images the disfigure ment of error fastens upon it from its inability to separate itself from the images of objects perceived by the senses and see itself in isolation they have stuck to it under the strange adhesive power of love and its impurity in the struggle to see itself by itself arises from the supposition that it really is that which it cannot think itself without therefore what is required by the injunction to know itself is not that it should seek for a self that has been as it were removed from itself but that it should remove its own additions to itself for the mind itself is a more inward reality not only than the things of sense which are plainly external to it but also than the images of them which exist in a certain part of the soul possessed by animals as well though animals lack the intelligence which is peculiar to mind to this inwardness of the mind it is a kind of outgoing from itself when the passion of love is directed upon those images which are a sort of vestige left behind by many acts of attention such vestiges are imprinted upon the memory by the sensations derived from external bodies so that even in the absence of the objects their images remain available for thought the mind 84 augustine later works then is required to know itself not by seeking for a self sup posedly absent but by fixing upon itself the direction of the will which was wont to stray elsewhere and reflecting upon itself then it will see that it has never been without either the love or the knowledge of itself but that through the love of something else alongside itself it has confounded itself with that and as it were coalesced with it and so by embracing the diverse as a unity it has come to believe that what are in fact diverse are one and the same thing 12 ix the mind’s task is not to seek for the beholding of an absent self but to be sure that the self which is present is clearly discerned not to know itself as previously unknown but to distinguish itself from what it knows to be another matter indeed it can take no steps to act on the words know thyself if it is ignorant of the meaning either of know or of thyself if it knows both it knows itself for the saying know thyself has a different sense from a saying like know the cherubim and seraphim our knowledge of them is belief concerning beings not present to us based on the statement that they are a kind of heavenly power it is different again from saying know the will of that man a thing which can only be perceived or understood when conveyed to us by bodily signs and leads then rather to belief than to understanding and it is different from saying see your face which can only be done in a imrror our own face cannot be present to our observation because it is not in a position that we can observe but when one says to the mind know thyself in the moment of its understanding the words thyself it knows itself for the simple reason that it is present to itself if it does not understand what it is told of course it does not do it what it is being enjoined here to do is what it does in the act of understanding the injunction 13 x thus when the mind hears the command to know itself it must avoid the addition of any extraneous element to what it knows itself as being it knows at least that this command is addressed to itself that self which exists and lives and understands existence belongs equally to the corpse life to the beast understanding belongs to neither the mind knows therefore that its existence and life are the existence and life of understanding so it may suppose itself for example to be air it may suppose that air is intelligent but it knows that itself has intelligence whereas it does not know but only supposes that it is air it must set aside what is supposition and look at the trinity 85 what is knowledge retaining what was never doubted even by those who have supposed mind to be a body of one kind or another not every mind thinks itself to be air some have thought themselves fire some brain others this or that other material substance as noted above but all alike know that they understand exist and live understanding being relative to its object while existence and hfe are absolute conceptioias it is beyond doubt that understanding implies life and life implies existence from which it follows that the possessor of under standing has an existence and a life different from those of the lifeless corpse and the non rational soul of a peculiar and trans cendent kind again men know that they possess will and they also know that will implies existence and hfe and is relative to an object willed they know that they have memory and also that memory implies existence and life memory itself being similarly relative to the thing remembered of these three func tions memory and understanding are the two in which our manifold experience and knowledge are embraced while their enjoyment or their use depends on the application of will we enjoy things known in which the will rests satisfied for their own sake we use what we relate to something else as object of enjoyment nothing but wrong use or wrong enjoyment con stitutes the faultiness and blameworthiness of human life but that is not our present subject 14 we are concerned now with the nature of the mind and we have to exclude from our consideration everything which enters our acquaintance from outside by the bodily senses and concentrate our attention upon the points which all minds know with certainty about them selves whether the powers of life recollection understanding will thought knowledge judgment are properties of air or of fire or of brain or of blood or of atoms or of some fifth body distinct from the familiar four elements or whether they could all be produced by the composition or harmonization of our fleshly substance as to all this men have doubted and one has attempted to affirm one theory another another but no one can possibly doubt that he lives and remembers understands wills thinks knows and judges for even if he doubts he lives if he doubts what has made him doubt he remembers if he doubts he understands that he is doubting if he doubts he wishes to be certain if he doubts he thinks if he doubts he knows that he is ignorant if he doubts he judges that he ought not to be hasty in assenting a man may doubt everything else 7 gf above p 66 n 86 augustine later works but he should not doubt any of these facts for if they were not so he could doubt of nothing 15 the theories which treat the mind as material or as the compounding or harmonizing of matter would represent all these activities as properties of a material subject the real sub stance will be air or fire or whatever else of material nature is supposed to be the mind while understanding is contained therein as a quality the subject will be the mind regarded as body understanding and the other activities which we have described as certainly belonging to us will be properties of that subject the view of those who deny that the mind itself is body but make it the composition or harmony of a body is much the same the only difference is that the other theories maintain the mind to be the substance and subject of which understanding is a property while this will have the mind itself to be a property of that bodily substance of which it is the compounding or harmonization it must then consistently regard the under standing as a property of the same body which is its subject 16 all these theories neglect the fact which we have demon strated that the mind knows itself even while it seeks itself by no means can anything properly be said to be known in the absence of knowledge of its substance therefore when the mind knows itself it knows its substance when it is sure of itself it is sure of its substance that it is sure of itself is what our argument has proved it is not at all sure whether it is air or fire or any material thing or condition of matter therefore it is none of these things and the whole purport of its being bidden to know itself is to assure it that it is none of those things of which it is not sure and to make it sure that it is and only is what alone it is sure of being it has a particular way of thinking of fire air or any other material object and it would be impos sible for it to think of itself in the same way as it thinks of what is not itself for it thinks of au those things fire air this body or that or some part composition or harmony of body by means of some representative image it is not of course alleged to be all the things named but only one or other of them but whichever of them it were it would think of it in a different way from the rest i mean not by any imagined picture as we think of absent objects with which the bodily sense has brought us 8 augustine had used this argument which anticipates descartes as early as the de lihero arbitno ii 3 of 388 and the de vera rehgione 73 of 390 the famous stfallor sum comes from the de civitate xi 26 see also de tnn xv 21 xu the trinity 87 into contact whether the picture be of the objects themselves or of others of the same kind but by a kind of inward presence real and not imaginary for nothing can be more present to it than itself in the way that it thinks of its own living and re membering and understanding and willing itself all this it knows within itself and does not imagine it as though previously sensed by some external contact like the experience of material objects if it avoids tacking on to itself anything derived from its thoughts of such material things so as to suppose itself similar in kind to them then the account of itself which remains will be the account of what alone it is 17 xi and now setting aside for the moment the other activities which the mind is sure of its possessing let us take for particular consideration these three memory understanding will 9 on these three points we are accustomed to examine the capacities of children to find what talents they display the more tenacious and ready is a boy’s memory the more acute his understanding the more eager his will to learn so much the more praiseworthy do we count his disposition when however it is a question of the learning of any individual we enquire not how much strength and readiness of memory or sharpness of understanding he possesses but what he remembers and what he understands and seeing that a person is judged praiseworthy not only according to his learning but also according to his goodness we take note not only of what he remembers and understands but of what he wills not simply of the eagerness of his will but first of what he wills and then of how much he wills it for a person who loves intensely only merits praise when what he loves is what ought to be loved intensely in the three fields of disposition learmng and practice or use the test of the first depends upon the individual’s capacity in respect of mem ory understanding and vdll the test of the second upon the content of his memory and understanding and the point to which an eager will has brought him but the third use belongs entirely to the will as it deals with the content of memory and understanding whether as means relative to a particular end or as an end in which it may rest satisfied to use is to take a thing up into the disposal of the will whereas to enjoy is to use 5 the choice of these three from among the various activities enumerated in 14 above is not simply dictated by what augustme knows he wants to make of them of the others life is not peculiar to nund while thought knowledge and judgment are forms of understanding or memory for the meaning of the terms see introduction ad fin 88 augustine later works with a satisfaction that is not anticipated but actual thus all enjoyment is a kind of use since it takes up something into the disposal of the will for final delectation but not all use is enjoy ment if what is taken up into the disposal of the will has been sought after not for its own sake but as a means to something else o 1 8 now this triad of memory understanding and will are not three lives but one nor three minds but one it follows that they are not three substances but one substance memory regarded as life mind or substance is an absolute term re garded as memory it is relative the same may be said of understanding and of will for both terms can be used relatively but life mind essence are always things existing absolutely in themselves therefore the three activities named are one inas much as they constitute one life one mind one essence and whatever else can be predicated of each singly in itself is pre dicated of them all together in the singular and not in the plural but they are three inasmuch as they are related to one another and if they were not equal not only each to each but each to all they could not cover or take in one another as they do for in fact they are covered not only each by each but all by each i remember 12 that i possess memory and understanding and will i understand that i understand and will and remember i will my own willing and remembering and understanding and i remember at the same time the whole of my memory and understanding and will whatever i do not remember as part of my memory is not in my memory and nothing can be more fully in my memory than the memory itself therefore i remem ber the whole of it again whatever i understand i know that i understand and i know that i will whatever i will but what ever i know i remember therefore i remember the whole of my understanding and the whole of my will similarly when i understand these three i understand all three in whole for there is nothing open to understanding that i do not understand except that of which i am ignorant and that of which i am ignorant i neither remember nor will it follows that anything 10 this is a refinement of the distinction between use and enjoyment into which augustme is led en passant it confuses rather than illuminates the distinction ii this phrase repeated at the end of the section had been used by augus tine of the trinity of being knowmg and willing in conf xiii i2 xi 12 note that augustine is using remember not in the sense of actually recollecting but m that of being able to recall see introduction ad ftn for the meaning of the terms memory and understanding the trinity 89 open to understanding that i do not understand i neither re member nor will whereas anything open to understanding that i remember and will i understand finally when i use the whole content of my understanding and memory my will covers the whole of my understanding and the whole of my memory therefore since all are covered by one another singly and as wholes the whole of each is equal to the whole of each and the whole of each to the whole of all together and these three constitute one thing one life one mind one essence 19 xii we might now attempt to raise our thoughts with such power of concentration as is at our disposal towards that supreme and most exalted essence of which the human mind is an image inadequate indeed but still truly an image yet it may be better to illustrate more clearly the presence in the soul of these same three functions by means of our bodily sense per ceptions of external objects in which there is impressed upon us in the process of time a knowledge of material things we found the nature of the mind in its memory understanding and willing of itself to be such that it must be apprehended as always knowing and always willing itself and therefore also as always at the same time remembering itself understanding and loving itself although it does not always keep the thought of itself clearly separated from things which are not identical with it this makes it difficult to distinguish in it the memory of self and the understanding of self when they are closely con joined neither preceding the other in time it may look as though they were not two but one and the same thing under different names even love may cease to be felt as such if not disclosed by the sense of want as when its object is continually 13 in fact augustine has so far nowhere said that the mind always possesses the memory understanding and wilhng of itself which would imply that both understanding and will like memory exist in the mind unconsciously before they are consciously realized in bk xiv 9 vi he refers to w'hat he has said here and proceeds to develop the distinction between under standing as a conscious act of thought cogitatio and the unconscious knowledge on which it depends it is only in the conscious act of under standing that he can find what he means by the birth of the word accordmgly in bk xiv though he maintains the idea of a permanent and unconscious state of the triad memory understandmg will it is in its conscious realization that he has to look for his final demonstration of the image of the trimty cf bk xiv 10 vii 13 x in bk xv 41 xxi however he notes that in virtue of the inherence of under standing and will in memory both can exist below the conscious level augustine later works 90 present all this may become clear to the slower thinker in the course of an examination of those temporal processes which add to the content of the mind or otherwise affect it when it remem bers what it did not remember before when it sees what it did not see before and when it loves what it did not love before this examination however demands to be taken in hand in the next book book xi the image in the outward man argument we are to look for a likeness of the inward man in the outward and the particular sense we shall examine is that of sight 1 we can distinguish i the external object of vision ii the perception of it in the sense organ iii the mental attention which fixes the eye on the object a sense and attention belong to the perceiving subject and are independent of the object the form printed on the sense organ is product of the object only of which this form is a like ness or image distinct from the object itself its existence in the sense organ is proved e.g by our experience of the after image of a luminous object on closing the eye and the dupk cated image of an unfocused vision the three elements are thus diverse in substance but the third the voluntary act of atten tion brings the two former into close union and is capable when its emotional tone is intense even of producing changes in the body of the percipient 6 when a remembered percep tion is recalled to mind we can observe a corresponding trinity of imagination this time entirely within the mind composed of memory inward vision and the will which directs attention upon the object in the memory the resulting mental image may even be mistaken for the real thing especially under the influence of strong desire or fear 2 both sense perception and imagination can lead us astray a life according to the trinity of the outward man is a bad life this trinity therefore as belonging to the external and material world cannot be a true image of god though it may contain a likeness of him a in the trinity of sense object and vision are heterogeneous and cannot properly be styled parent and offspring the act of attention is a nearer 91 02 augustine later works analogue of the spirit being neither parent nor offspring its end or realization in the vision can be related as a means to the will’s pursuit of the ultimate good b in the trinity of imagination the thing remembered and the inward vision are no more than quasi parent and quasi offspring for the inward vision though taking form from the memory existed before the impression on it of the particular form the act of will is both homogeneous with the memory and in a sense proceeds from it we cannot e.g want to recollect what we had for dinner yesterday unless we remember that we dined thought or inward vision can form images which may differ from the actual content of memory though it is always dependent on memory even when evoked by what is described by another person memory is to some extent controllable by the will which can abstract the attention from what is presented to the senses 3 in both trinities it is to be noted that the will’s function is to link together either a external object with sense image or b memory image with thought vision each of these four being product or offspring of the preceding memory is limited by experience imagination is not we can think of black swans or four footed birds so we may see in memory thought vision and voluntary attention the measure number and weight of wisdom 11 20 in which god has ordered all things book xii knowledge and wisdom argument where is the knk between outward and inward man 1 we share sense perceptionj and perhaps memory with animals yet the rationality which distinguishes man from beast is in part concerned with direction of our bodily and temporal life in part with our contact with eternal truth it is partly active partly contemplative as in the union of male and female there is here a binding together of two in one flesh the division in the human mind is one of function only there may be a trinity in either function but we shall have to seek the true image of god in the higher rather than the lower 2 we must reject the idea that the trinity is imaged in the triad of man woman and child the image of god in gen 1 127 must be understood as an image of the trinity and not of any one person but certainly adam and eve were not created with a son paul’s saying in i cor 11 7 that man as opposed to woman is the image of god is best interpreted in accordance with the distinction above suggested of the double function higher and lower of the rational mind in any case when he speaks of the new man in col 3 9 10 he does not mean to exclude the christian woman from renewal in god’s image man and woman alike possess the same human nature in its completeness 3 the fall of man is the result of the lower reason throw ing off the control of the higher and devoting itself to the pursuit of the material and temporal man seeks to be his own master to have private possessions instead of his share in the universal good and through preferring the knowledge which puffs up to the love of wisdom sinks below the level of the rational in the story of the forbidden fruit is symbolized the 93 94 augustine later works yielding of the higher reason adam to the solicitations of the lower eve which has already been perverted by the flesh the serpent so that sinful desire becomes sinful act this is a better exegesis than to take the woman as symbolizing the bodily senses which we share with the beasts 4 the lower reason has its proper place in the right use of things temporal as means to eternal life the distinction of knowledge and wisdom is suggested by i cor 13 8 and job 28 28 knowledge abstaining from evil is concerned with moral activity and the human history which instructs us therein wisdom is the contemplation of those eternal forms or prin ciples of which plato wrote though his doctrine that the soul retains a memory of them from a former existence is unsatis factory it is better to believe that the mind is enlightened by a spiritual sun as the eye by the physical 5 before we look for our image of the trinity in that wisdom whereby the mind contemplates things eternal we have to consider the likeness which may be traced in our knowledge of the temporal book xiii the trinity of faith argument i the distinction between higher and lower reason wisdom and knowledge laid down in book xii is illustrated by the prologue of john’s gospel where w 1 5 refer to things eternal w 6 14 to things temporal to known history and the faith based upon it we have an immediate vision or knowledge of faith in ourselves while we can only believe its presence in others 2 yet there are some behefs and desires which are so gener ally entertained that we can almost regard them as universal the desire for happiness beatitude is certainly universal though the great variety of beliefs as to what constitutes hap piness proves that the knowledge of it is by no means equally so the true definition of happiness is not living as you will but the satisfaction of all wants when nothing is wanted wrongly for some objects of desire are bad and cannot make us happy it is human perversity when both these conditions of happiness are unattainable to prefer the satisfaction of wants to the con fining of wants to what ought to be wanted in this hfe hap piness is never without alloy if we truly desire happiness we are desiring immortality since if life ends happiness ends and the loss of happiness even in expectation cannot be good 3 faith alone can assure us of our capacity for immortality in john’s words power to become sons of god and this faith rests upon the incarnation cross and resurrection of christ no other way could have been more fit to rescue us from despair than the assurance of god’s love the love for sinners who can have no merits that are not his gifts this love by which we are justified in his blood reconciled by his death is not the act of one person of the trinity but the eternal love of father son and holy ghost 95 augustine later works 96 4 by god s just and righteous permission the sin of the first man put the whole race in the power of the devil though the devil himself remains under the power of god both devil and fallen men pursue power rather than righteousness justice but righteousness is the condition of power and not vice versa just as for happiness the good will must precede the power to live as we will therefore the devil’s power could be overcome only by righteousness the sinless christ submitting for righteous ness sake to an unjust death at the devil’s hands deprived him of his right to power over men though the temporal suffer ings and bodily death which were the penalty of sin remain for the trial of our faith the death of christ thus justifies us because through faith we share in his righteousness even as we had shared in adam’s sin 5 the historic incarnation and atonement on which our faith is based thus fall within the sphere of knowledge rather than of wisdom but in the word made flesh are the treasures of wisdom as well as of knowledge in christ we move through the latter to the former 6 there is a trinity of faith when things believed are held in the memory and recalled to thought by the act of will and if their truth be accepted and loved there is a life according to the inward trinity yet it is not here that we can trace the full image of god book xiv the perfection of the image tn the contemplation of god argument trae wisdom in men is the worship of god i 2 its object is the eternal and divine while knowledge is of the temporal and human and we have treated faith as belonging to the sphere of knowledge so that the image of the trinity to be discerned in faith must needs be a transient thing 3 5 the true image of god in the human mind must be permanent and unchanging even though it be temporarily defaced 6 the existence of self knowledge m the mind of the infant is problematical in the adult the mind comes into its own view only in the act of thinking though always present to itself in the memory which is the source from which its self understanding is begotten 7 8 in fact apart from the conscious act of thought there is always a sort of unconscious self understanding and self willing stored in the memory 9 but since the act of thought is required for the production of the word we have a better image of the trinity in the conscious act than in the im conscious memory 10 the mind is god’s image par excellence in virtue of its capacity for knowing god its trinity is self contained and so distin guished both from the trinity of sense perception and from the trinity of faith 11 5 which will pass away as will the moral virtues appropriate to this life of action 12 in the mind’s self knowledge there is nothing adventitious 13 it is ever present to itself and its memory is not related to past time 14 the perfection of the divine image in the mind is the divine gift of wisdom by which the mind becomes aware of god 15 and is not only in god but with god 16 through the revival in it of that memory of god which was never entirely 97 gs augustine later works obkterated 17 the mind’s self love is true that is for its own good only when grounded on the love of god 18 19 for which as for the knowledge of god it possesses a natural capacity and which alone can satisfy its needs 20 the restoration of the image to its original perfection is the work of grace enabling the mind to turn again to the light of which even when it was averted therefrom it felt the touch as shown e g by its power of moral judgment 21 22 this renewal after the image of the creator is a gradual process whereby the mind’s love is re directed upon god and it reaches perfection only in the final vision of god 23 24 when we shall be like him for we shall see him face to face no true lover of wisdom can doubt the immortality of the soul 25 the text i i we are now to consider the nature of wisdom but not the wisdom of god which assuredly is god himself for it is the name given to his only begotten son.i we are to speak of a human wisdom which is yet a true wisdom as being in accord ance with god and consisting in his true and peculiar worship this in greek is denoted by the single word theosebeia which our latin translators wishing to have one word to correspond to it have rendered as we have already noted pietas or godly fear the more usual greek for pietas however is eusebeia tkeosebeia cannot be perfectly rendered in one word and it is better to use two and call it det cultus the worship of god that this is man’s wisdom as laid down in the twelfth book of the present work is proved by the authority of holy scripture in the book of job the servant of god there we read that the wisdom of god has said unto man behold the fear of the lord pietas is wisdom and to abstain from evil is knowledge 2 or as some have translated the greek episteme discipline which can stand for knowledge as being itself derived from discere or learning for our purpose in learning anything is to know it discipline has indeed another sense as applied to the troubles suffered by a man for his sins with a view to correction so the epistle to the hebrews says who is the son to whom his father dealeth not discipline or again more obviously all discipline for the time seemeth not to be joyous but grievous but afterwards it shall yield the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them that have striven through it 3 1 1 cor 1 24 2 job 28 28 3 heb 12 7 u the trinity 99 the supreme wisdomj then is god himself and the worship of god is the human wisdom of which we are now speaking for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god it is of the wisdom which is the worship of god that holy scripture says the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world 2 but if it takes wise men to discourse of wisdom we are in a difficulty in order that our discourse of it may not be imper tinent are we to presume so far as to profess wisdom we should rather take warning from the example of pythagoras who dared not profess himself wise and said in answer to his questioners that he was only a philosopher that is a lover of wisdom this was the origin of the name which so approved itself to later thinkers that the greatest learning in matter of wisdom whether claimed or acknowledged would entitle a man to no more than the name of philosopher was the reluctance of such men to pro fess wisdom due to their supposing that the wise man must be altogether without sin at any rate that is not the teaching of our scriptures which say rebuke a wise man and he will love thee to count a man in need of rebuke is surely to find him guilty of sin but even so i would not dare to profess myself wise it is enough for me that it belongs to the philosopher or lover of wisdom to discourse about wisdom and that no one can deny for those who have professed themselves lovers of wisdom rather than wise have not ceased to discourse upon it 3 wisdom has been defined in such discourse as the know ledge of things human and divine i too in a preceding book s have expressed the opinion that acquaintance with both things divine and human can be called both wisdom and knowledge but if we adopt the apostle’s distinction to one is given the word of wisdom to another the word of know ledge it is proper for us to break up this definition giving the name of wisdom in its strict sense to the knowledge of divine things while of human things we speak in the strict sense of knowledge this i have cfiscussed in my thirteenth book where i assigned to this latter knowledge not anything that a man can know of human affairs a great part of which is matter of superfluous vanity or harmful curiosity but only that by which the most wholesome faith that leads to true blessedness is begotten nourished defended and strengthened 4 i cor 3.19 wisdom

though in the faith itself they are most strong for it is one thing simply to know what is to be believed for the attainment of the eternal life which alone is blessed it is another to know how this faith gives succour to the godly and has its defence against the un godly which the apostle seems to describe by the particular term knowledge in speaking of it i have already been con cerned chiefly to commend the faith itself i first briefly dis tinguished the eternal from the temporal and proceeded to deal with the sphere of the temporal i postponed to this book the treatment of things eternal but i showed that even of them there is a faith which is temporal indeed and comes in process of time to dwell in the hearts of believers yet is necessary for the attainment of the eternal i argued the benefit for this attainment of that faith concerning the things which in time the eternal wrought for us and suffered in the man whose humanity he wore in time i and exalted to eternity and i maintained that the virtues which give prudence courage temperance and justice to life in this temporal and mortal state are true virtues only if they be related to this same faith which temporal as it is conducts us to the things eternal 4 ii it is written so long as we are in the body we are sojourners away from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight i2 accordingly so long as the just lives by faith i 3 though his life be that of the inward man he can only strive for the truth and make his way towards the eternal by means of the faith which is temporal not yet can there be in the holding and contemplation and love of this temporal faith a trinity fit to be called the image of god else that which must be established in the eternal would seem to be established in things temporal when the mind of man sees its own faith believing what it does not see it is not looldng upon what is everlasting what it sees will not be always so will assuredly not be so when at the end of the sojourning in which we are absent from the lord and must walk by faith shall come the turn of sight in which we shall see face to face we see not so now but because we believe we shall be found worthy to see and shall rejoice that n fecit et passus est in homine quern temporaliter gessit a phrase which is remark able as combming the truths for which the ghristologies of alexandria and antioch were

seen it may be then that we shall remem ber this mortal life that will be past and recall our former belief of what we did not see but that faith will be set down among things past and gone not present and ever abiding it will be found therefore that the trinity which now appears in the remembering beholding and loving of the faith now present and abiding is then a thing not permanent but past and gone we must conclude that if that trinity is indeed the image of god this image itself must be counted as belonging not to that which always is but to that which passes away iii but if the soups nature is immortal so that after its original creation it can never cease to be god forbid that the soups most precious possession should not endure with its own immortality and what can be more precious in its created nature than its making in the image of its creator not therefore in the holding con templation and love of faith which may not be for ever but in what shall always be we must find the image of god worthy of that name 5 but let us test the truth of this conclusion by a closer and more careful enquiry it may be argued that this trinity does not perish even when faith itself has passed away on the ground that just as now we hold the faith in memory perceive it in thought and love it in will so then when our former possession of it shall be remembered and thought upon and the memory and reflection united by our will the same trinity will remain unchanged for if it were to pass and leave no kind of trace in us then there would be nothing of it in our memory to which we could recur in remembering it as past and linking by the effort of attention the two elements what was in the memory without our thinking of it and what is given form by thought this argument fails to notice the difference between two trinities one when our present faith is held seen and loved within us and another which will exist when not faith itself but a sort of imaged trace of it laid up in the memory is contem plated in recollection and the will unites the content of memory and the impression of it in the mind’s view to enable this to be understood let us take an example from the material world which occupied us sufficiently in the eleventh book in the ascent from lower to higher or the entry from outward to inward we discovered a first trinity in the material object of sight the view of the beholder to which it 102 augustine later works gives form in the moment of vision and the exercise of will which unites the two we may postulate a trinity on similar lines when the faith now existing in us like the material body m space is contained in our memory and from it form is given to the thought which recollects it just as the bodily object gives form to the view of the beholder these two elements become a trinity by the addition of the will which hnks and joins together the faith contained in the memory and the reproduction of it imprinted in the recollecting contemplation just as in the trinity of bodily vision the form of the body seen and the con forming thereto of the beholder’s view are united by the exer cise of will now let us suppose that the material body which was the object of vision has dissolved and perished leaving nothing of itself at any point in space to the sight of which the eye could be re directed the fact that an image of the material object now past and gone remains in the memory to give form to the recollecting view so that these two elements may be con joined by the will does not allow us to call the resulting trinity the same as that which had existed when the real body was seen in space it is an entirely different one not only does it belong to the internal sphere whereas the other belonged to the ex ternal but it is produced by the image of a body no longer there instead of by the actuality of an existing body so in the case under consideration for the sake of which the parallel has been drawn the faith at present in our mind like the body in space constitutes a kind of trinity in being held regarded and loved but the trinity will not be the same when this faith has ceased to exist in the mind as the body has ceased to be in space when we come to recollect its existence in us as past and no longer present it will unquestionably be a different trinity the one we have now is produced by the presence of the thing itself and its attachment to the believing mind the one we shall have then will be product of the picturing of what is no longer existent left behind in the memory as object of recollection 6 iv we may say then neither that we shall have the image of god in that trinity which does not exist at present nor that we have it now in die trinity which then will exist no longer we must find in the rational or intellectual soul of man an image of its creator planted immortally in its immortal nature we can speak of the soul’s immortality only in a quali fied sense for there is a death of the soul when it is without that bliss which must be accounted its true life we call it immortal because even in utmost wretchedness it never ceases to live a the trinity 103 life of a sort in the same way though reason and understanding may at one time be dormant in it and at others appear either small or great the human soul is never anything but rational and intellectual and for that reason if its making in god’s image represents its power to use reason and intellect for the understanding and the beholding of god we may be sure that from the first beginning to be of so great and marvellous a creature that image always remains whether it be so faded that scarcely anything of it is left whether it be obscured and defaced or clear and fair.i we may appeal here to a text of god’s scripture which expresses his pity for the defacement of its dignity although man walketh in an image yet is he vainly disquieted he heapeth up treasures and knoweth not for whom he shall gather them i vanity would not be ascnbed to the image of god were it not seen to be defaced and that no de facement can destroy its character as image is plain enough from the words though man walketh in an image the sen tence then will be equally true if its clauses are inverted and we read although man is vainly disquieted yet he walketh in an image human nature is a great thing but because it is not the highest it was liable to spoiling j and although liable to spoiling because it is not the highest yet because it has a capacity for the highest and is able to become partaker in it it remains great we must look then in this image of god for a trinity of an unique kind trusting in the help of him who made us in his image for there is no other way of sound enquiry into the matter or of discovery according to the wisdom which comes from him but the reader will not need more words here upon the method to be followed if what was said in earlier books especially the tenth of the human soul or mind be remem bered and re considered or reference be made to the pages containing that discussion 7 in the tenth book it was said among other things that the mind of man knows itself for nothing can be better known to 15 it is important to note tliat augustine finds the indelible image of god in man not in his rational nature as such but in his power to use his rationality for attaining knowledge of god 16 ps 39 6 the although on which augustme builds his fanciful exegesis may have been suggested by the lxx it does not appear m the vulgate 17 this follows from the doctrme that the only changeless nature is the divme isle the discussion at the end of bk x of memory imderstandmg and will 1 bk x 10 vii augustine later works 104 the mind than what is immediately present to it and nothing can be more immediately present to the mind than itself the point was also established to our satisfaction on other grounds v what then are we to say of the mind of the child as yet so small and so profoundly ignorant that its mental darkness is almost frightening to the more or less instructed adult perhaps even the child s mind may be thought to know itself but to be so pre occupied with experiences of the pleasures of sensation all the greater for their novelty that it cannot reflect upon itself though unable to be ignorant of itself the intensity of the child’s interest in the external objects of sensation may be seen in the single example of its avidity for the light if from care lessness or ignorance of the possible effect one puts a night light by a child’s cot in a position where the child as it lies can turn its eyes towards the candle but is unable to move its head it will gaze on the light so fixedly that cases are known where a squint has resulted through the eyes retaining the position in which their delicate young structure has become set by habit and we find the same intense concentration of interest in the child’s soul upon the other bodily senses so far as its age allows so that strong repulsion or appetite will only be excited in it by what offends or attracts the flesh its thoughts are not turned inward upon itself and introspection cannot be suggested to it since it is still ignorant of the means of suggestion which are principally the words of which as of so much else it knows nothing but it was shown in the same book that not to reflect upon oneself is a different thing from not knowing one self 8 tiowever we may pass over the age of infancy which we cannot question about its experiences and which we ourselves have largely forgotten it will be enough for us to take it as cer tain that when a man becomes able to think about the nature of his own mind and to discover the truth he will not discover it elsewhere than in himself and what he will discover is not something he did not know but something he did not think about what can we know if we are ignorant of what is in our own mind since the mind is the necessary medium of all our knowledge vi yet such is the power of thought that it is only by thinking that the mind can set itself as it were in its own view nothing is in the mind’s view but when it is thought about and that implies that even the mind itself which is the only agent of thought can only be in its own view by thinking 20 bk x 7 v the trinity 105 about itself the question how it can be conceived not to be in its own view when not thinking of itself although it can never be separated from itself is one that i cannot answer it seems as if its view and itself were two different things which is a reasonable enough way of speaking in the case of the bodily eye for while the eye itself has its own fixed position in the body its view is directed to external objects and can extend even to the stars nor is the eye in its own view at all since it cannot see itself except as reflected in a mirror as we remarked before whereas there is nothing to correspond with that reflection when the mind by the thought of itself places itself in its own view we can hardly suppose that in thinking of itself the mind is seeing one part of itself with another part as we see with one part of our body the eye other parts which can be in our view the supposition and the statement of it are equally absurd if the mind is removed it is removed from itself if it is set in its own view it is set before itself this implies a change in its position from the one occupied when it was not in its own view as though it were removed from one place and set in another but if it has shifted in order to be seen where does it stay in order to see is there a sort of duplication of it so that it can occupy two positions one for seeing and another for being seen in itself for seeing before itself for being seen the truth will return none of these answers to our enquiries for the fact is that this way of thinking is occupied with images drawn from material objects and that the mind is no such thing is absolutely certain at least for those few minds that can tell us the truth in this matter it remains only for us to recog nize that the view of the mind is something essential to its nature to which it is recalled when it thinks of itself by no spatial movement but by a spiritual turning and when it is not thinking of itself though it is not in its own view and its seeing is not defined by its nature yet it knows itself in its capacity as self memory in the same way the knowledge possessed by the expert in a number of sciences is contained in his memory and no part of it is in the view of his mind except when he thinks of it the rest being shut away in that hidden storing place of know ledge which we call memory hence we developed an account of the mental trinity in which memory supplied the source from which the thinker’s view receives its form the conformation itself being a kind of image imprinted by the memory and the agency by which the bk x 5 ill i06 augustine later works two are conjoined being love or will thus when the mind re gards itself in the act of thought it understands and takes knowledge of itself we may say that it begets this self under standing and self knowledge for an object that is incorporeal is seen when it is understood and is known by the act of under standing but this begetting by the mind of self knowledge when it regards itself as understood in thought does not imply that it was previously unknown to itself it was so known in the way that things held in the memory are known though not thought upon as we say that a man knows letters even when he is thinking not of letters but of other things and to these two the begetter and the begotten we have to add the love which joins them together and is simply the will pursuing or embracing an object of enjoyment 22 accordingly for the indication of our mental trinity we found these three names appropriate mem ory understanding and will 9 towards the end of the same tenth book we said that the mind always remembers itself and always understands and loves itself although it does not always think of itself in isolation from all that is of a different nature from itself 2 3 we must ask then in what sense understanding is to be assigned to the act of thinking while the knowledge of any object which is in the mind even when it is not being thought about is properly assigned to memory alone if this is so the three functions of memory understanding and love of itself will not have been always present together in the mind it will only have had the memory of itself and the understanding and love of itself will have ensued when it began to think of itself vii to meet this difficulty let us look more closely at the case previously adduced to show the difference between not knowing a thing and not thinking of it so that it is possible for a man to know something of which he is not thinking when his thought is occupied with something else an expert in two or more arts may when he is thinking of one of them know another or a num ber of others even if he is not thinking of them but can we properly say this musician knows music but does not at this moment understand it because he is not thinking of it but he understands geometry at this moment for geometry is what he is thinking about such a statement appears to be absurd and no less absurd would be the statement this musician knows 22 this definition well shows the relation in augustine’s language of love will and enjoyment love does not cease to be love when its desire is satisfied 23 see note on bk x 18 xii the trinity 107 music but does not at this moment love it since he is not think ing of it but he loves geometry at this moment since geometry is what he is thinking about what we may quite properly say is this man whom you observe discussing geometry is also a finished musician for he remembers that art understands it and loves it but while knowing and loving it he is not at this moment thinking of it because he is thinking of the geometry which he is discussing this suggests to us the existence at the back of our minds of certain stores of knowledge of certain things which as it were come forward into the middle and take more open position in the mind’s view when they become the object of thought then the mind discovers that it remembered understood and loved what it was not thinking about while thinking of something else if there is a subject of which we have not thought for a long time and of which we cannot begin to think unless it is suggested to us then with regard to it we are in the strange position if the paradox may be allowed of not knowing that we know it in fact it is proper for the giver of the reminder to say to the receiver of it you know this but you do not know that you know it i will remind you of it and you will find yourself knowing what you had thought you did not know the same is the eflfect of a book written on some theme of which the reader is led by reason to discover the truth he does not take its truth on trust from the writer as when he is reading history he himself finds it to be true whether the finding be his own or that of the very truth which is the mind’s light the man whose blindness of heart is such that no prompt ing can enable him to perceive such truths is too deeply sunk in the darkness of ignorance and needs the miracle of divine aid in order to reach true wisdom 10 this was why i sought to illustrate the process of thought by some kind of example which might show how from the con tent of memory the remembering attention takes form and something is brought to birth in die person who thinks of the same kind as what was in him as the possessor of memory before the thinking process it is easier to distinguish things that are not simultaneous and where the parent is prior in time to the off spring if we look at the mind’s inward memory whereby it remembers itself its inward understanding whereby it under stands itself and its inward wiu whereby it loves itself we are dealing with a state in which these three are ever present to gether and were ever present together from their beginning whether they were objects of thought or not and thus it will i08 augustine later works seem that the image of the trinity belongs to the sphere of memory alone yet there can be no word without thought for we think whatever we say even if it be with the inward word that is of no particular language so the image is to be dis covered rather in the three functions of memory understanding and will understanding being here taken to denote the faculty by which we come to understand in the process of thought that is to say when our thinking takes form through the bringing forth of what was present to the memory but not thought of and the word will means the love which unites the offspring and its parent and which is in a manner common to both it was as i say in order to make these distinctions easier for the reader to grasp that i used in the eleventh book the field of external sense perception to illustrate them and thence ad vanced to the consideration of that faculty of the inward man which uses the power of reason upon things temporal while i postponed for later treatment the other and sovereign faculty by which he contemplates things eternal this occupied two books the twelfth dealing with the difference of one faculty from the other as the lower from the higher to which it should be subordinate and the thirteenth with the function of the lower as including the salutary knowledge of human affairs which helps us in this temporal life so to act that we may attain to the life eternal i treated of this as faithfully as i could but in brief for i had to cover in the limits of a single book a subject of manifold and copious detail which has been the theme of many great works of many great writers in this sphere also i pointed to a trinity though still not such a one as to be called the image of god ii viii now we have reached the point in our discussion at which we have undertaken to consider that highest element in the human mind whereby it knows or can know god with a view to our finding therein the image of god although the human mind is not of that nature which belongs to god yet the image of that nature which transcends every other in excel lence is to be sought and found in the element which in our own nature is the most excellent but first we have to consider the mind in itself before it has participation in god and discover his image there we have said that it still remains the image of god although an image faded and defaced by the loss of that participation it is in virtue of the fact that it has a capacity for god and the ability to participate in god that it is his image 24 cf 6 iv above n 15 the trinity 109 only because it is his image can so high a destiny be conceived for it here then is the mind remembering itself understanding itself loving itself perceiving this we perceive a trinity a trinity still less than god but already an image of god in this trinity the memory has not imported from outside what it should retain nor has the understanding discovered in the outer world the object for its beholding like the body’s eye the will has not in this case made an outward union of these two as of the material form and its derivative in the sight of the be holder an image of the external object seen taken up as it were and stored in the memory has not been discovered by thought directed towards it and thence form been given to the recol lecting attention while the two are united by the further activity of will this was the system displayed in those trinities which we found to exist in material processes or to pass some how into our inward experience from the external body through the bodily sense all this we discussed in the eleventh book nor is our present trinity the same as that which we found existing or presenting itself to us in our discussion of the know ledge as distinct from wisdom whose sphere is the activity of the inward man the objects of this knowledge form an ad ventitious element in the mind they may be introduced by historical information like the things done and said transacted and passing in time or the things locally and geographically situated in the natural world or they may arise from non existence within the man himself either through the teaching of others or through his own reflections like the faith which in the thirteenth book we set forth at such length or like the virtues which if they are real make the life of our present mor tal condition good in order that we may attain in the im mortality which god has promised us the life which is blessed these and the hke matters are disposed in a temporal succession which made it more easy for us to discover the trinity of memory vision and love s for some of them exist prior to the learners knowledge of them they are knowable before they are known and beget the knowledge of themselves in the learners either they still exist in their own places or they belong to time past in the latter case what exists is not themselves but certain signs of their past existence the sight or hearing of which gives the knowledge that they once were and now are past such signs 25 here vmo and am yr are exceptionally substituted for intelhgentia and voluntas no augustine later works may be locally situated as memorials of the dead and the like they may be preserved in credible works of literature such as any reputable and authoritative history or they may be in the minds of men who already know the facts what is already known to them is knowable for others to whose knowledge it is prior and who can come to know it through the instruction of those to whom it is known all this in the process of its being learnt presents a kind of trinity the reality which was know able before it was known the application to it of the knowledge of the learner which comes into existence with the learning and thirdly the will which unites the two and after the knowledge is acquired another tnnity appears in more inward form with its recollection in the mind itself composed of the images impressed in the process of learning upon the memory the form given to thought when the remembering attention is directed to them and the will which unites the two with regard to that which arises in the mind where it had not been before such as faith and the like this appears indeed to be adventitious in that it is implanted through teaching but it is not hke the objects of belief situated or transacted in the outer world but originates entirely within the mind itself faith is not the object but the act of belief the object is believed the act is perceived but since it originates in the mind which was already mind before faith began to exist in it it seems adventitious in character and it will be counted among things past when its place is taken by sight and itself ceases to be the trinity composed by faith when it is present as held regarded and loved is not as we have already said the same as that which will be traceable as a rehc left in the memory by its passing 12 ix it may further be asked whether in the life to come the virtues which make life good in our state of mortality must cease to be when they have brought the soul home to the eternal world for they too have their beginning in the mind which has a prior existence without them in which it is none the less mind some have supposed that they will cease and in the case of three of them prudence fortitude and self control this view has much in its favour but justice or righteousness at least is immortal and will rather be made perfect in us in the life to come than cease to be yet that great and eloquent writer cicero in his dialogue hortensim argues as follows concerning 26 cf 5 ill above 27 a lost work of cicero which made a lasting impression upon augustine in his youth see conf iii 7 iv the trinity iii all the four when we have passed out of this life we should be permitted as stories tell to hve immortally in the islands of the blest what need should we have of eloquence with no courts to plead in or even of the virtues themselves we could not require fortitude when no toil or danger confronted us or justice when no other man’s possessions could be coveted or self control for the ruling of passions no longer existing or even prudence when there would be no choice to make between good and evil our blessedness would consist solely in the cognizance and knowledge of nature which alone makes admirable even the life of gods from which we may infer that all the rest is grounded in necessity and only this in free will thus the great orator when he comes to sing the praises of philosophy recalling his debt to the philosophers and expounding it with mastery and charm maintains that all four virtues are necessary in this life only full as we know it of cares and errors but none of them when we have passed out of it if we are permitted to live where life is blessed he believes that the good soul is blessed through nothing else but the cognizance and knowledge which is contemplation of that nature which is supremely good and lovable the nature that is which has created and ordered all natures else if to be subject to that nature’s rule belongs to justice then justice certainly is immortal nor will it cease to exist in that blessed state but will be of a perfection and a greatness beyond the possibility of increase perhaps the other three virtues also prudence with no risk of error remaimng fortitude without the trouble of ills to be endured self control with no recalcitrant passions may yet exist in that state of happiness it may be the act of prudence to think no good pre ferable or equal to god of fortitude to cleave to him immov ably of self control to take pleasure in no harmful defection but the present work of justice in supporting the oppressed of prudence in taking heed of snares of fortitude in the endurance of troubles of self control in the restraint of corrupt pleasures of these there wiu be nothing in that life which will contain nothing at all of evil accordingly these activities of the virtues necessary to our mortal hfe as is the faith to which they must be referred will be accounted as things past and the trinity now composed when we hold regard and love them as present is not the same as that trinity which will exist w hen we find through those traces which their passing will leave in the mem ory that they once were but are no longer for there will be a trinity when of this so called trace there is both a retention in ii2 augustine later works the memory and a true recognition and a union of both by the will 13 x in the knowledge of all those temporal matters to which we have here referred certain of the things knowable pre cede the knowing of them by an interval of time such are the sensible properties which were already in the outward objects before they were perceived and all the facts of historical know ledge certain others originate simultaneously with being known if for example an obj'ect of sight which had no previous existence should arise before our eyes it cannot precede our knowing of it or if a sound is caused in the presence of a hearer the squi nd the hearing of it begin and cease simultaneously but wheiljfer their origin is precedent or simultaneous it is the knowables that beget the knowledge and not vice versa and when the knowledge has been effected and the things known take their place in the memory and are recalled to view in the act of recollection it is obvious that the retention in the memory is temporally prior both to the recollecting vision and to the union of the two by will it is not so however with the mind itself it cannot be adventitious to itself as though to a self already in being there should come from elsewhere an identical self previously non existent or as though instead of coming from elsewhere there should be born in the existing self an identical self which did not exist before in the way that faith arises from non existence in the existing mind nor does the mind after coming to know itself see itself by recollection as established in its own memory as though it had not been there before becoming the object of its own knowledge assuredly from the moment of its beginning to be the mind has never ceased to know itself to understand itself and to love itself as we have already demonstrated therefore in its act of turning upon itself in thought a trinity is presented in which it is pos sible to recognize a word formed from the act of thinking and united to its original by will here then is where we may recognize the image for which we are seeking 14 xi it may be objected that the faculty by which the mind which is ever present to itself is said to remember itself cannot properly be called memory for memory is of things past not of things present some writers upon the virtues including cicero have analysed prudence into the three ele ments of memory understanding and foresight assigning memory to what is past understanding to what is present and 28 cicero de inv rhet ii 53 the trinity ii3 foresight to what is future the last being reliable only in those who have fore knowledge of future events an attribute which does not belong to men unless it be given from above as to the prophets so the scriptural book of wisdom says of men that the thoughts of men are fearful and our foreseeings uncer tain 29 memory of things past and understanding of things present are reliable that is when the things present are in corporeal for corporeal things are present not to understanding but to the beholding of the bodily eyes in answer to the objec tion that there is no memory of things present we may point to an expression in secular hterature where there was more care for verbal correctness than for truth of fact ulysses would not brook such outrage nor in that testing hour forget himself when vergil says that ulysses did not forget himself he is say ing in other words that the hero remembered himself and that since he was certainly present to himself could only be if memory were apphcable to things present memory therefore in the case of things past denotes the faculty by which they may be reviewed and recollected in the case of an object present as is the mind to itself the same name may be given without ab surdity to the mind’s possession of itself m such a way as to be understandable by its own act of thought and to be capable of the union of possession and understanding through the act of self love 15 xii now this trinity of the mind is god’s image not because the mind remembers understands and loves itself but because it has the power also to remember understand and love its maker 31 and it is in so doing that it attains wisdom if it does not so the memory understanding and love of itself is no more than an act of folly let the mind then remember its god in whose image it was made let it understand him and love him in a word let it worship the uncreated god who created it with the capacity for himself and in whom it is able to be made partaker for this cause it is written behold the worship of god is wisdom 32 wisdom will be the mind’s not by its own illumination but by partaking in that supreme light and only when it enters eternity will it reign in bhss but to say that a man may possess such wisdom is not to deny that it is the 29 wisdom 9 14 30 verg aen ill 628 f 31 the remaimng chapters of the book contain the climax of the whole argument 32 job 28 28 augustine later works 1 14 property of god god’s is the only true wisdom were it human it would be vain yet when we call it the wisdom of god we do not mean the wisdom wherewith god is wise he is not wise by partaking in himself as is the mind by partaking in god it is rather as we speak of the righteousness of god not only in the sense of that whereby god is righteous but of that which he gives to man when he justifies the ungodly to which the apostle refers when he speaks of those who being ignorant of god’s righteousness and willing to establish their own right eousness were not subject to the righteousness of god 3 in the same way we might speak of some who being ignorant of the wisdom of god and wilhng to estabhsh their own were not subject to the wisdom of god 16 there is an uncreated being who has made all other beings great and small unquestionably surpassing all that he has made and so surpassing also the reasonable and spiritual being of which we have been speaking namely the mind of man made in the image of its creator and the being surpassing all others is god he is indeed not far from each one of us as the apostle says adding for in him we live and move and have our being 4 if this were spoken in a material sense it could be understood of our material world for in it too so far as our body is concerned we hve and move and are we must take the text then as spoken of the mind which is made in his image and of a manner of being more excellent not visible but spiritual what is there indeed that is not in him of whom holy scripture says for from him and through him and in him are all things 5 if in him are all things in whom save in him in whom they are can the hving hve or the moving move yet au men are not with him after the manner of the saying i am alway with thee nor is he with all after the manner of our own saying the lord be with you it is man’s great misery not to be with him without whom man cannot be certainly man is never without him in whom he is yet if a man does not remember him does not understand him nor love him he is not with him but complete oblivion makes it impossible even to be reminded of what we have forgotten 17 xiii we may take on this point an example from the visible world a man whom you do not recognize says to you you know me and as a reminder he tells you where when and how you became acquainted with him if after you have 33 rom 4 5 10 3 34 acts 17 27 f 35 rom 1 1 36 36 ps 73 23 the trinity 13 5 been given all the clues which could revive your memory of him you stiu do not recognize him it means that you have for gotten him so completely that no trace of the former knowledge remains in your mind and nothing remains but for you to believe his assurance that you once knew him or not even that if the speaker does not appear to you worthy of credit if however you do remember clearly you are going back to your memory and finding there what had not been entirely for gotten and obliterated let us now return to the point which led us to draw this parallel from human intercourse we find in the ninth psalm the words tet the sinners be turned into hell all the nations that forget god qr again in the twenty second all the ends of the earth shall be reminded and shall turn unto the lord these nations then had not so far forgotten god that they could not remember him when re minded by forgetting god as though forgetting their own life they had been turned unto death that is into heu but on being reminded they turn to the lord reviving again through the remembrance of their life of which forgetfulness had deprived them we may compare the text of the ninety fourth psalm understand now ye unwise among the people return at last ye fools to wisdom he that planted the ear shall he not hear etc 39 the words are addressed to those who through lacking understanding of god have spoken vain things concermng him 18 xiv for the love of god we can find many references in scripture where the presence of the other two elements in the mind is logically implied in that no one can love what he does not remember or of which he is wholly without know ledge most familiar is the first great commandment thou shalt love the lord thy god 0 the natural constitution of the human mind is such that it is never without the memory the understanding and the love of itself but since with hate of a man goes the desire to do him hurt it is with good reason that man’s mind may be said to hate itself when it is hurtful to itself its ill will to itself is unconscious because it does not suppose that what it wants is injurious yet in wanting what is injurious it is willing evil to itself so it is written he that loveth iniquity hateth his own soul therefore the man who knows how to love himself loves god while the man who does not love god though he retains the love of self which belongs to his nature may yet properly be said to hate himself when he does 37 ps 9 17 38 ps 212 27 39 ps 94 8 f 40 deut 6.5 41 ps 11 5 augustine later works il6 what is contrary to his own good and behaves to himself as an enemy it is indeed a fearful delusion by which though all men desire their own advantage so many do only what works their ruin a like distemper in dumb animals is described by vergil in the words god guard his servants from such error and send it on his enemies to tear with naked fangs their mangled limbs 2 the poet can speak of a bodily disease as error inasmuch as every creature is naturally its own friend and guardian and the effect of this disease was to make beasts mutilate the body whose well being was their aim when the mind loves god and consequently as has been said remembers him and understands him there rightly follows the command concerning one’s neighbour to love him as one self for the mind’s love of itself becomes right instead of per verted when it loves god by partaking in whom the image we speak of not only exists but is transformed from old to new from disfigurement to shapeliness from unhappiness to beatitude the power of self love is such that if a man must choose he will rather lose all that he loves in the world below him than him self be lost only with the god above him to whom the psalmist sings my strength will i keep safe with thee and again draw near unto him and be lightened can a man keep safe his strength and enjoy the divine light as his own but the mind that forsakes the god above it becomes so feeble and darkened that through loves it cannot quell and errors out of which it sees no way of return it falls miserably away from itself into the things which are ahen and inferior to itself so the penitent who already has knowledge of god’s mercy cries in the psalm my strength hath forsaken me and the light of my eyes is not with me 19 yet even in such evil case of infirmity and error the mind could not lose its natural memory understanding and love of itself and so is justified the saying quoted above though man walketh in an image yet is he vainly disquieted he heap eth up treasures and knoweth not for whom he shall gather them why does he heap up treasures but because his strength hath forsaken him the strength in which possessing god he could have need of nothing and why does he not know 42 verg georg iii 513 f 43 ps 59 9 34 5 44 ps 38 10 45 bk xiv 4 11 the trinity ii7 for whom he shall gather them but because the light of his eyes is not with him so that he cannot see what the truth would tell him thou fool this night they require thy soul of thee then whose shall those things be which thou hast prepared yet man fallen as he is still walketh in an image and his mind retains a memory understanding and love of himself so that if it were made plain to him that he cannot have both and a choice offered of one of the two with loss of the other either the treasures which he has gathered or his mind there is no one so mindless as to prefer treasures to mind treasures can very often overthrow the mind but the mind that is not overthrown by treasures can live an easier and more unhampered life with out any of them nor can there be any possession of treasures save by means of the mind an infant born to the greatest riches though master of all that is legally his possesses nothing when his mind slumbers how then can anything be possessed by one whose mind is lost indeed it is superfluous to urge that any man confronted with the choice must prefer the depriva tion of treasures to the deprivation of mind no one could prefer treasures or even compare them for value to the eyes in his body which give possession not as of gold to the favoured few but of the wide heaven to every man by use of the bodily eyes everyone possesses all that he delights to see who then would not choose if he could not keep both and must perforce be de prived of one to lose his treasures rather than his eyes yet if he were asked on similar terms whether he would rather lose eyes or mind every mind must see that he would keep his mind and lose his eyes for the mind without the eyes of flesh is still human but the eyes of flesh without mind are the eyes of a beast who would not rather be a blind man than a seeing beast 20 my purpose in this argument has been to bring home in brief to the least acute intelhgence among those who may read or hear what i have written the force of the mind’s love of itself even when it is weak and erring through the mistaken love and pursuit of what is beneath it now it could not love itself if it were altogether ignorant of itself that is if it had no memory of itself and did not understand itself such potency it has by virtue of this image of god that is in it that it can be strong to cleave to him whose image it is it has been set in that place in the order of reality which is no spatial order where there is none above it but god and when its cleaving to him has become 46 luke 12.20 il8 augustine later works absolute it will be one spirit with him witness the words of the apostle he that is joined to the lord is one spirit 7 xhe mind will be raised to the participation of his being truth and bliss though nothing thereby be added to the being truth and bliss which is his own in that being joined to it in perfect hap piness it will hve a changeless life and enjoy the changeless vision of all that it will behold then according to the promise of holy scripture its desire will be satisfied with good things with goods unchanging the very trinity itself its god whose image it is and that never again despite be done to that image it will abide in the secret place of his counten ance so filled with his abundant riches that sin can never more delight it but here and now when the mind regards itself the thing it sees is not unchangeable 21 xv of that it can have no doubt since it is miserable and longs for blessedness only be cause it can change can it hope that blessedness is possible for it for if it were unchangeable it could pass neither from bliss to misery nor from misery to bliss nothing could have brought it to misery under a lord omnipotent and good but its own sin and its lord’s righteousness nothing will make it blessed but its own desert and its lord’s rewarding and even its desert is the grace of him whose reward its blessedness will be 50 for it cannot give itself the righteousness which it has lost and lacks in ile creation of man it received that righteousness and by its own sinning inevitably lost it there fore it must receive the nghteousness for which it may deserve to receive beatitude to a mind inclining to take pride in a good supposed of its own making the truth is told by the apostle what hast thou that thou hast not received and if thou hast received why dost thou boast thyself as though thou hadst not received 5i but when it duly remembers its lord it receives his spirit and becomes fully conscious of the truth learnt from the indwelling teacher that it can rise only by his undeserved goodness even as it could have fallen only by its own voluntary default it has indeed no memory of its own blessedness for that was once and is no longer and the mind has totally forgotten it so that no reminder can bring it back it can only beheve on the faith of the scriptures of its god written by his prophet the story of a happiness of paradise and 47 i cor 6 17 48 ps 103 5 49 ps 31 20 50 man’s good deservings are the gift of god enchirid 28 cvii 51 1 cor 4 7 the trinity the account conveyed in narrative form of man’s original good and evil but it has the memory of the lord its god for he ever is neither was and is not nor is and was not but never was not even as never he will not be and he is every vhere in his wholeness so that in him the mind lives and moves and has its being and therefore has the power to remember him not that it recollects having once known him in adam or anywhere else before this bodily hfe or at its first making and planting in this body of none of these things has it any memory whatsoever all of them are buried in oblivion but it can be so reminded as to turn again unto the lord who is the light by which even in its turning away from him it was still somehow touched hence comes the ability even in the godless to think of an eternal world and rightly to assign blame and praise in the field of human morality the norms by which they make such judg ments must be those m which they see how every man ought to live though their own lives be no example of it where do they see such norms not in their own nature for while it is cer tainly the mind that sees them their minds are admittedly changeable and the changelessness of these norms is manifest to all who have the power to see it not in the fashion of their own mind for the norms are norms of righteousness and their minds are admittedly unrighteous where are the norms written in which what is nghteous is recognized by the unrighteous in which he sees that what he has not is truly worth having where but in the book of that light which is called truth 3 out of which every righteous law is copied and passes into the heart of the man who works righteousness passes not by transference but by impression even as the seal of a ring passes into the wax without leaving the ring but as for him who works not and yet sees what right worlang is he it is who turns aside from the light by which none the less he is being touched the man who does not even see how he ought to hve sins with more excuse since he is not transgressor of a law he knows yet even he may sometimes feel the touch of truth’s omni present shining when he admits the justice of an admonition 22 xvi those who are moved by the reminder to turn again to the lord out of that state of deformity wherein worldly desires conformed them to this world must receive from the lord their re forma tion according to the apostle’s saying be not conformed to this world but be reformed in newness of your mind 54 the 52 augustine will not allow that the fall has severed man’s relation to god 53 gf bk viii 9 vl 54 rom 12 2 120 augustine later works beginning of the image’s re forming must come from him who first formed it the self which it was able to deform it cannot of itself re form in another place the apostle says be renewed in the spint of your mind and put on the new man which is created after god in righteousness and holiness of truth 5 5 xhe words after god correspond to what we read elsewhere in the image of god 6 through sm righteousness and holiness of truth were lost wherefore this image has become deformed and faded the mind receives it again when it is re formed and renewed the spirit of your mind does not here imply two separate things one the mind and the other the mind’s spirit it means that while every mind is a spirit not every spirit is a mind god also is a spirit who cannot be renewed since he cannot grow old the word spirit is also used for something in a man which is not mind and to which belong imaginings in the like ness of bodily objects we find this in the text of the letter to the corinthians if i pray with a tongue my spirit prayeth but my mind is unfruitful that describes what happens when what is spoken is not understood it could not be spoken unless the images of material sounds were present in the thought of the spirit before their vocal enunciation again the human soul may be called spirit as in the words of the gospel he bowed his head and gave up his spirit signifying the body’s death when the soul leaves it spirit may even be applied to a beast this is explicit in the book of solomon ecclesiastes where we read who imoweth the spirit of the sons of men whether it shall ascend upwards or the spirit of the beast whether it shall go down into the earth 9 also in the book of genesis concerning the death in the flood of all flesh that had in itself the spirit of life 0 the word is used also of wind a thing plainly material as in the psalms fire and hail snow and ice the spirit of the storm spirit then having so many possible senses paul means by his phrase the spirit of the mind that spirit which we call mind similarly the same apostle writes in the putting off of the body of flesh here there is no implication of two different things one flesh and the other the body of flesh but since many fleshless things may be called body many bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial other than those of flesh paul uses body of flesh for that 55 eph 4.23f 56 gen 1 27 57 l cor 14 14 58 john 19 30 59 eccl 3.21 50 gen 7 22 51 ps 148 8 52 col 2 11 the trinity i2i body which is flesh and in the same way he uses spirit of the mind for the spirit which is mind elsewhere we find the image named more explicitly as when the same exhortation is given in other words putting off the old man with his doings put on the new man who is renewed in the knowledge of god after the image of his creator 3 where the former text has after god the latter gives after the image of his creator and where the former has in righteous ness and holiness of truth we have in the latter in the know ledge of god thus the renewal and reforming of the mind takes place after god or after god’s image it is said to be after god to exclude its being supposed to be after some other creature and after god’s image to make it plain that the renewal is effected in the place where god’s image is that is in the mind in the same way w e say of the faithful and right eous departed that he is dead after the body but not after the spirit dead after the body means dead with or in the body and not dead with or in the soul to speak of a man as beautiful after the body or strong after the body not after the mind is to say that his beauty and strength is not mental but bodily the manner of speech is very common we are not then to understand after the image of his creator as implying some other image after which man is renewed rather than the actual image which is renewed 23 xvii of course the renewal of which we speak is not effected in the single moment of return like the renewal which takes place in baptism in a single moment through the remission of all sins none whatsoever remaimng unremitted but it is one thing to be reheved of fevers and another to regain health after the weakness which fevers have caused it is one thing to withdraw a dart from the body and another to heal by further treatment the wound it has inflicted so here cure’s beginning is to remove the cause of sickness and that is done through the forgiveness of all sins its furtherance is the healing of the sick ness itself which takes effect by gradual progress in the renewal of the image both are displayed in one text of the psalm where we read who shows mercy upon all thine iniquities which happens in baptism and then who healeth all thy sick nesses which is a matter of daily advances whereby the 3 col 3 9 f 4 less so in english than in latin the word after has been taken as the nearest equivalent of augustine's secundum ps 103 3 122 augustine later works image is made anew of this the apostle has spoken in plain terms if our outward man decays yet is our inward man re newed from day to day 56 renewed as he has told us in the texts just quoted in the knowledge of god that is in righteousness and holiness of truth he who is thus renewed by daily advancing in the knowledge of god in righteousness and holiness of truth is changing the direction of his love from the temporal to the eternal from the visible to the intelligible from the carnal to the spiritual diligently endeavouring to curb and abate all lust for the one and to bind himself in charity to the other in which all his success depends on the divine aid for it is the word of god that without me ye can do nothing 7 when life’s last day finds a man in such advancing and in creasing firm in the faith of the mediator the holy angels will be waiting to bring him home to the god whom he has served and by whom he must be perfected and at the world’s end he will receive an incorruptible body not for punishment but for glory for in this image the likeness of god will be perfect only in the perfect vision of god of which vision the apostle paul says now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face and again but we with unveiled face beholding the glory of the lord are transformed into the same image from glory into glory as from the spirit of the lord which des cribes the daily process in those who go forward as they ought 24 xviii from the apostle john we have the saying beloved now are we sons of god and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be but we know that when he appears we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is 7o this shows that the full hkeness of god is reahzed in his image only when it has attained the full vision of him it may indeed be thought that the words of john refer to the immortality of the body for in that too we shall be hke to god if only to the son since he alone in the trinity has taken upon him a body in which he died and rose again and which he carried with him into heaven we may speak here also of an image of the son of god in which we shall have an immortal body hke him conformed in that particular to the image not of the father or of the holy spirit but of the son only for of him alone do we read and receive in most wholesome faith that the word was made flesh 7 i thus the apostle says whom he foreknew them he also predestinated 66 ii cor 4 1 6 67 john 15 5 68 i cor 13 12 69 ii cor 3 18 70 john 3.2 71 john i 14 the trinity 123 to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be first born among many brethren first born indeed of the dead in the words of the same apostle that death whereby his flesh was sown in dishonour and rose again m glory 4 after this image of the son to which we are conformed through im mortahty in the body we do according to another saying of paul’s as we have borne the image of the earthly let us bear also the image of him who is from heaven s that is let us who after adam were mortal believe with true faith and sure and steady hope that after christ we shall be immortal for so can we bear the same image now not yet in vision but in faith not yet in reality but in hope the apostle in fact was speaking of die resurrection of the body in the context of this saying 25 xix but if we think of that image of which it is writ ten let us make man in our image and hkeness not in my image or m thy image we must believe that man was made in the image of the trinity and this is what we have de voted our best efforts to trace out and understand accordingly we may better interpret in the sense of this image the words quoted from john we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is the apostle is speaking here of him of whom he has said we are sons of god moreover the immortahty of the flesh will be made perfect in the moment of resurrection which as paul says will be in the twinkling of an eye in the last trump and the dead shall be raised uncomipted and we shall be changed for in the twinkling of an eye there shall rise again before the judgment in strength incorruption and glory that spiritual body which now is being sown a natural body in weakness corruption and dishonour but the image that is being renewed in the spirit of the mind in the knowledge of god not outwardly but mwardly from day to day will be made perfect by that vision face to face that shall be after the judg ment the vision which now is but a growing through a glass darkly and its perfecting is what we should understand by the words we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is this is the gift then to be given us when we hear the call come ye blessed of my father possess the kingdom prepared for you 7 then shall be taken away the godless so that he sees not the glory of the lord when those on the left hand go into w rom 8 29 col 1 1 8 74 i cor 15 43 75 i cor 15 49 76 gen 1 26 77 i cor 15 5a 78 1 cor 13 12 79 matt 25 34 124 augustine later works eternal punishment and those on the right into eternal life and as the truth has told us this is life eternal that they may know thee the one true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent this wisdom of contemplation is i believe in its proper sense distinguished in holy scripture from knowledge and named wisdom a human wisdom yet coming to man only from god partaking in whom the reasonable and intellectual mind can be made wise in truth at the end of his dialogue hortensius we find cicero commending this same wisdom if he says we give day and night to such meditations if we sharpen our understanding which is the mind’s eye and take good heed that it grow not dull if that is to say we live the life of philosophy then we may have good hope diat if our power of feeling and thought is mortal and transient it will be pleasant for us to pass away when the duties of our human life are done nor will our extinction be an offence to us but rather a repose from living and if on the other hand as the greatest and most famous of ancient philosophers have believed our souls are eternal and divine then we may fairly suppose that the more constant a soul has been in following its own course that is in the pursuit of reason and the ardour of enquiry and the less it has mingled and involved itself in the faults and errors of man by so much the easier will be its ascent and return to its heavenly country after which he adds this final sentence in which he resumes and concludes his discussion therefore to end this long discourse if it is our will either to pass quietly into nothingness after these pursuits have occupied our life or to travel forthwith from our present home to another that will be far better to these studies we ought to give all our energy and attention it is a wonder to me that so powerful a mind should offer to men who live the life of philosophy the hfe which gives blessed ness in the contemplation of truth a pleasant passing away when the duties of their human life are done if our power of feeling and thought is mortal and transient as though this would be the death and destruction of something which we loved so little or even hated so fiercely that its passing away would be pleasant to us he had learnt that not from the philosophers to whom he gives such high praise his opinion savoured rather of the new academy which had persuaded him to scepticism even upon the most manifest of truths the tradi tion which came to him from those philosophers who on his own 80 john 17 3 the trinity 125 admission were the greatest and most famous was that souls are eternal for eternal souls indeed the exhortation is appropriate that they be found when the end of this life comes upon them following their own course that is in the pursuit of reason and the ardour of enquiry and that aey should avoid the min gling and involvement of themselves in the faults and errors of men in order that their return to god may be the easier but the course that is set in the love of truth and enquiry after it is not enough for men unhappy as all must be whose mortality is supported by reason alone without the faith of the mediator that is what i have done my best to show in earlier books of this treatise especially the fourth and thirteenth book xv review and re valuation image and original argument we have been seeking for an image of the trinity in the highest of created things and this search for god even though it must be endless is justified by scripture 1 3 summary of the discussion in books i xiv 4 5 our conception of the divine being is built up of a number of attributes which we derive from our rational judgments of value 6 all these terms denote the one divine substance which belongs equally to the three persons of the trinity but we may reduce them to the three attributes of eternity wisdom and blessedness 7 8 even these three might be regarded as all implied in one viz wisdom 9 by reference to the image of god traced in his gift of wisdom to the mind we may say that the divine wisdom is trinity in virtue of its own self knowledge and self love 10 yet the analogy remains imperfect d in that the human trinity of wisdom is in man as a part of his nature whereas the divine trinity is itself constitutive of the divine nature 1 1 b in that the human faculties of memory understand ing and will are not interchangeable whereas in god we can not confine memory to the father understanding to the son and love or will to the spirit 12 our temporal modes of existence and thought make it impossible for us to comprehend a wisdom which is both memory and fore knowledge 13 we see in a glass darkly 14 16 none the less we can gain a certain understanding of the second person’s relation to the first by considering the inward speech or unspoken word which takes place in our act of think ing 17 19 the thought prior to all language of which lan guage is no more than a sign for the purpose of communication 126 the trinity 127 like the flesh assumed by the divine word this human word is the source of all human activity even as the divine word is that through which all things were made 20 but in many respects our human image of the divine word is inadequate a the knowledge which ves it form is scanty and uncertain we have indeed some ultimate certainties but they are few 21 i god’s knowledge is not acquired or conditioned from without it precedes all his creative activity and is inseparable from his being 22 the correspondence of the divine word to the divine knowledge is perfect 23 d the human word is not always born of true knowledge 24 and even a true word is not always present and actual because it is not always the object of thought at best it is formable not formed once and for au 25 26 the holy spirit as proceeding from both father and son may be regarded as the mutual charity of the first and second persons 27 but scripture says that god is charity and we have already seen the objection to identifying any person of the trinity with any one of the members of our mental triads 28 only the terms word gift and source of generation or procession can rightly be assigned to the several persons ex clusively yet if the word is more especially or appropriately named the wisdom of god there may be a similar fitness in naming the spirit charity 29 30 and this is confirmed by the language of i john 4 31 charity is indeed the supreme gift 32 and scripture is clear that the holy spirit is the gift of god 33 36 the holy spirit nghtly may receive the name of charity as proceeding from father and son and constituting the communion of both for both are spirit 37 charity how ever remains a term of the essence or substance of godhead and the heretical attempt to distinguish the divine will from the divine nature in the interest of arianism must be rejected 38 memory understanding and will offer us an image of the trinity in so far as they are mutually inherent and inseparable activities 39 41 but the analogy is defective in that the real actor is the human person or subject possessed of these three powers or faculties whereas the trinity is not in one god but is itself the one god though constituting not one person but three 42 43 all discussion of the image in the human mind has value only as it is inspired by the faith that it is an image and no more that it is sin which blurs the image and darkens our vision and that only in the life to come shall we see face to face 44 128 augustine later works for our present understanding it is hard to perceive the dif ference between generation of the son and procession of the spirit we cannot speak of either in temporal terms 45 christ gave the spirit as god received it as man 46 but the procession of the spirit is an eternal fact no less than the divine generation of the son to which there can be no parallel in our mental life it is a fact in the being of the father which with all else he imparts to the son 47 48 on this matter the un believer must accept the teaching of scripture before he can hope for any measure of understanding 49 we can but see in our image of the trinity that thought or word is begotten of remembered knowledge while will bears a dif ferent relation to both 50 let us end our work not with argument but with prayer 51 the text i i our design of preparing the reader by the study of the things that are made for the knowledge of their maker has brought us to the image of god which man presents in virtue of that which sets him above all other animals namely reason or intelligence with any other characteristic of the reasonable or intellectual soul that is properly to be assigned to what we call mens or animus mind i the word animus is used by some latin writers as a technical term to distinguish the higher element in man which is lacking in the beast from the amma or soul which is present in beast as well as man if we look for a being above this and look for an existing reality it must be god the being not created but creator and whether this being is a trinity is a question not only to be decided for faith by the authority of holy scripture but one to which we ought if we can to give some rational answer satisfactory to the understanding my reason for saying if we can will emerge in the course of our actual discussion of the question 2 ii the god whom we seek will i doubt not give us the help we need that our labour be not fruitless then shall we understand what is written in the psalm let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord seek the lord and be strengthened seek his face alway 2 one might suppose that what is always sought is never found and that the heart of them that seek must rather grieve than rejoice if they cannot find what they seek 1 see introduction fin augustine here makes it clear that reason is not the only activity of mens 2 ps 105 3 f the trinity 129 it is not said let the heart of them that find rejoice but of them that seek the lord yet that the lord god can be found through seeking we are assured by the word of the prophet isaiah seek the lord and call upon him that ye may find him presently and when he draweth near to you let the un godly leave his ways and the wicked man his thoughts if then he can be found when he is sought why are we bidden seek his face alway perhaps because even when he is found he must be sought enquiry concerning the incomprehensible is justified and the enquirer has found something if he has suc ceeded in finding how far what he sought passes comprehension comprehending the incomprehensibihty of what he seeks yet he will go on seeking because he cannot slacken his pursuit so long as progress is made in the actual enquiry into things incom prehensible so long as he is continually bettered by the search after so great a good both sought that it may be found and found that it may be sought stiu sought that the finding may be sweeter still found that the seeking may be more eager so we may interpret the words put into wisdom’s mouth in the book ecclesiasticus they that eat me shall still hunger and they that drink me shall still thirst they eat and drink because they find because they hunger and thirst they still seek faith seeks understanding finds wherefore the prophet says unless ye believe ye shall not understand and again understanding yet seeks him whom it finds for god hath looked upon the sons of men we sing in the psalm to see if there be one that is understanding or a seeker after god man is called to be understanding to the end that he may seek after god 3 thus the care with which we have dwelt on that which god has made will have been justified by its purpose that thereby we might come to know the maker for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world being understood through the things which are made are clearly seen hence the reproof in the book of wisdom of those who could not out of the good things that are seen know him that is neither by considering the works did they acknowledge the artificer but deemed either fire or wind or the swift air or the circhng of the 3 isa 55 6 f 4 ecclesiasticus 24 2 1 5 isa 7 9 in this text so important for augustine’s doctrme of under standing as the reward of faith he retains the older latin version from the lxx the vulgate represents the hebrew with non perman ebttis ye shall not endure 6 ps 14.2 7 rom 1 20 130 augustine later works stars or the violence of waters or the luminaries of heaven to be the gods which govern the world with whose beauty if they were so delighted as to account them gods let them know how much better the ruler of them is for the first author of beauty hath created them or if they marvelled at their strength and working let them understand from these things how much mightier is he that ordered them for by the greatness of the beauty and the creation the creator of them might recognizably have been discerned i quote these verses from the book of wisdom that in my search for pointers to that supreme trinity which we seek when we seek for god i may not seem to any of the faithful to have wasted my labour in beginning with the creature and so moving by stages through a number of special trinities up to the mind of man 4 iii the necessities of discourse and argument have ob liged us to deal in the course of fourteen books with many mat ters which we can hardly embrace in a single view so as to apply them without hesitation to the point we desire to grasp i shall therefore do my best god helping to summarize without discussion the results of our discussions in each book and so to make accessible at a glance not the grounds of our conclusions but the conclusions themselves in this way our later results will not be so far separated from the earlier that examination of the later will drive the earlier from our minds or if it does we shall be able readily to look back and recollect what was forgotten 5 book i showed the testimony of holy scripture to the unity and equality of the supreme trinity books ii iii and iv dealt with the same theme but the detailed enquiry into the missions of the son and of the holy spirit occupies the three books it was shown that the person sent is not less than the sender because of that relationship the trinity which is equal throughout working inseparably without any difference in the changelessness invisibility and omnipresence of its being book v met the argument that the substance of the father and of the son is not the same on the ground that nothing can be predicated of god which does not denote substance and that therefore begetting and being begotten or the begotten and the unbegotten being different predicates must denote different substances it was shown that not all that is predicated 8 wisdom 13 1 ff this hardly describes the procedure of the de tnmtate itself in which all the trinities studied have been psychological the trinity 131 of god denotes substance as do the predicates good and great and any others denoting what he is in himself but that there are also predicates of relation denoting not what he is in himself but what he is in relation to something which is not himself as he is called father in relation to the son or lord in relation to the creature that is subject to him if he is given a relative predicate such as implies temporal process as for ex ample lord thou hast become our refuge 10 that does not denote a happening to him involving change he himself in his nature or essence remains altogether changeless book vi discussed the meaning of the apostolic titles of christ the power of god and the wisdom of god postponing for further consideration the question whether he of whom christ is begotten is not wisdom himself but only the father of his own wisdom or whether wisdom has begotten wisdom but however that should be answered this book also served to make clear the equality of the trinity and that god is not treble god three times over but trinity father and son do not make up a double as against the singleness of the holy spirit and the three are not anything more than any one of them the book ended with a discussion of the meamng of bishop hilary’s phrase eternity in the father form in the image use in the gift book vii dealt with the question adjourned to the effect that god as begetter of the son is not only father of his own power and wisdom but also power and wisdom in himself the same holding of the holy spirit yet there are not three powers or wisdoms but one power and one wisdom as there is one god and one essence then it was asked in what sense we speak of one essence and three persons or in the greek manner of one essence and three substances the terms were found to meet the need of a form of speech that would provide a single answer to the question what are the three whom we truly confess as three namely father son and holy spirit book viii applied the method of reasoning to make it clear to the understanding that in true substance not only is the father no greater than the son but neither are both together a greater thing than the holy spirit alone nor are any two in the trinity a greater thing than one nor all three together 10 ps 90 i hilary de tnn ii 34 augustine wrongly supposes that hilary’s term ustisy which referred to the work of the spirit in sanctification was meant to indicate the embrace or mutual enjoyment of father and son 132 augustine later works greater than each severally then i endeavoured to make intelligible so far as that may be the incorporeal and change less nature of god using the notions of the truth which is understood and seen the supreme good from which all good proceeds the righteousness for which a righteous soul is loved by one not yet righteous and finally the charity which in holy scripture is called god and in which an actual trinity begins to show itself to the understanding in the form of lover the beloved and love book ix carried the argument to that image of god which is presented by man in his mental nature there we find a kind of trimty in the mind the knowledge whereby it knows itself and the love whereby it loves itself and its knowledge and these three are shown to be equal to one another and of one essence book x gave a more thorough and precise investigation to the same subject which led to the discovery in the mind of a trinity more manifest in the form of memory understanding and will but it was also found that the mind can never have been without the memory understanding and love of itself although it does not always think of itself and when it does the same act of thought does not cause it to distinguish itself from what is corporeal we therefore postponed our consideration of the trinity of which this is an image in order to discover a trinity in the actual process of bodily perception and thereby to offer the reader a less obscure field in which to exercise his power of penetration book xi accordingly took the visual sense as an example findings in which could be recognized as valid for the other four senses thus was disclosed a trinity of the outward man first in external vision composed of the physical object seen the form impressed from it upon the view of the beholder and the act of voluntary attention which links the two but the members of this triad are plainly neither equal to one another nor of one substance and we proceeded to the discovery of another trimty in the mind itself imported from the field of outward sense in which the same three appeared as consubstantial the imaging of the object as retained in the memory the actualizing of the form derived from it when the thinker’s view is directed thither and the act of voluntary attention which unites them even this trinity was recognized as belonging to the outward man inas much as it results from the perception of external objects book xii laid down the distinction between wisdom and knowledge and looked first in the inferior realm of knowledge in the trinity 133 the strict sense of the word for a special kind of trinity this belongs indeed to the inward man but cannot yet be regarded as the image of god or so entided book xiii developed this enquiry by way of an exposition of chnstian faith book xiv proceeded to a discourse on man’s true wisdom the wisdom distinct from knowledge conferred by god’s gift through a partaking in god himself and this led to the emerg ence of a trinity in the image of god constituted by man in his mental nature which is renewed in the knowledge of god after the image of him who created man in his image 12 and in that renewal acquires the wisdom in which there is a contemplation of things eternal 6 iv and now the time has come for us to direct our search for the trinity which is god upon that eternal world bodiless and changeless in whose perfect contemplation we have the promise of a blessed life the life that must needs be eternal the being of god is not only asserted by the authority of divine scripture the universe of nature which environs us and to which we ourselves belong proclaims its dependence on a supremely good establishes he has given us a mind and a natural reason whereby we discern the relative values of things preferring the living to what is without life the sentient to what is without feeling the understanding to what is without intelligence immortal to mortal potent to impotent righteous to unrighteous beautiful to ugly good to evil incorruptible to corruptible immutable to mutable invisible to visible incor poreal to corporeal blessed to miserable and inasmuch as we do not hesitate to set a higher value on the creator than on things created we are obliged to allow that he must have life at its highest and awareness and understanding of au things that he cannot suffer death corruption or change that he is no body but a spirit most potent righteous beautiful good and blessed 7 v but all these attributes and any others that human modes of expression may worthily assign to god belong both to the whole trinity which is the one god and to the several persons in that same trinity neither of the one god the trinity itself nor of father or son or holy spirit may any man presume to speak as without life sentience or understanding or to suggest that any of them in that being in respect of which they are accounted equal to one another is either mortal or corruptible or changeable or corporeal or to deny to any of 12 col 3 10 gen 1.27 134 augustine later works them the fullest power righteousness beauty goodness and blessedness if then these and all similar terms are to be pre dicated both of the trinity itself and of the several persons therein where or how can they display the nature of trinity let us begin by reducing their indefinite number to some thing smaller what we call life in god is his very essence and nature the life by which god lives is what he is to himself but that life is not the hfe of a tree without understanding or sentience nor the life of a beast which possesses sentience in its five divisions but no understanding the life that is god has consciousness and understanding of all things and its conscious ness is mental not bodily since god is spirit it is not through a body that god is conscious like the embodied animal for he is not composed of soul and body his uncompounded nature is conscious as it understands and understands as it is conscious his understanding is the same as his consciousness nor is the life of god such as ever to cease or ever to begin for it is im mortal rightly is it said of him that he alone hath immortal ity 14 for true immortality belongs only to him in whose nature there is no possibihty of change and the changelessness of god is the effect of his true eternity without beginning without end from which follows his incorruptibility so it is one and the same thing to call god eternal or immortal or incorruptible or changeless and it is the same thing to call him living and under standing which implies wisdom he has not acquired a wisdom to make him wise but is himself wisdom and this is his life and at the same time the strength or power and the beauty for which he is called potent and beautiful nothing could have more power and beauty than the wisdom which reacheth mightily from one end to the other and sweetly ordereth all things 15 again goodness and righteousness cannot lie apart from one another in god’s nature as they do in his works there are not two different qualities of god one goodness and an other righteousness his righteousness is his goodness and his goodness is his blessedness as for the term incorporeal it is used of god simply in the sense that for our faith or under standing he is spirit and not body 8 if then we call god eternal immortal incorruptible changeless living wise potent beautiful righteous good blessed spirit the last of these terms may be thought to denote substance only and all the rest qualities of that substance but 13 john 4 24 14 i tim 6 16 is wisdom 8 i the trinity 35 this distinction does not exist in the ineffable and uncom pounded nature of god terms which appear to denote quahty must here be taken as denoting substance or essence we may never say that god is spint in substance and good in quality he is both in substance the same applies to all the terms we have applied to him as we have argued at length in previous books 1 5 the first four of these terms as above enumerated in order were eternal immortal incorruptible changeless since these four denote one thing as i have explained let us select some one of them in order to concentrate our thought say the one that comes first eternal let us do the same with the second four living wise potent beautiful here we note that life of a sort belongs to the beast who is without wisdom that wisdom and power may in a man be so contrasted with one another that scripture can say better is the wise than the strong and that we normally use the word beautiful of bodily things our best choice among these four will therefore be wise although in god there is no inequality between the four since the four words stand for one thing in the case of the last group of four terms it is true that righteousness in god is identical with good ness and blessedness and spirit is identical with all three but in men there can be an unblessed spirit there can be one righteous and good who is not yet blessed whereas none can be blessed who is not a spirit both righteous and good let us then choose the term which even in men must carry the three others with it namely blessed 9 vi can we then say that these three terms eternal wise blessed constitute the trinity which we call god we have reduced our terms from twelve to three but possibly we might make a further reduction of these three to some one of them if wisdom and power or life and wisdom may be one and the same thing in the nature of god why should not this hold of etermty and wisdom or of blessedness and wisdom then just as in our reduction of the larger to the smaller num ber it made no difference whether we used the twelve terms or the three so it will make no difference whether we use the three or the single one to which we have suggested that the two others might similarly be reduced and then we shall hardly find a line of argument a force or power of understanding a vigour of reasoning or a penetration of thought sufficient to the reference is especially to bks v and vi wisdom 612 vulgate 136 augustine later works show without regard to all the rest how the trinity may be found in the application to god of this single term wisdom god does not learn wisdom from any other source as we do from him he is his own wisdom since in him for whom to be is to be wise his wisdom and his essence are not distinguishable things it is true that in holy scripture christ is called the power of god and the wisdom of god s g t we discussed in our seventh book the interpretation of this text so as to avoid imply ing that the son makes the father wise and our conclusion was that the son is wisdom from wisdom as he is light from light god from god and we were forced to extend the same argu ment to the holy spirit admitting that he also is himself wis dom all together constituting one wisdom as they do one god and one essence of this wisdom then which is god how shall we understand that it is trinity i do not say how shall we believe for of that there should be no question among the faithful but if there is any way by which understanding may give us a vision of what we believe what can that way be 10 we may recall that it was in the eighth book that the manifestation of the trinity to our understanding began there we essayed to lift up so far as might be the effort of our mind to the understanding of that most excellent and changeless being which is other than our mind in contemplation we were aware of it as not far from us and yet above us not spatially but by its own most reverend and wonderful excellence so that we found it present in us in virtue of its own pervading light but so far we had no glimpse of the trinity because we could not in that dazzling brightness direct our mind’s eye steadily to look for it.i all that we could with some clearness distinguish was that it was no measurable mass in which the quantity of two or three must be believed greater than that of the two only when we came to consider charity which in holy scripture is called god the light began to break upon a trinity consisting in lover the beloved and love but from that ineffable light our gaze flinched away we had to confess that our mind in its weak ness was not yet strong enough to be conformed to it and there fore in order to recruit our labouring efforts we paused in the pursuit of our undertaking and turned back to the more familiar consideration of that same mind of ours in which man has been made after the image of god and from the ninth to the four teenth book we occupied ourselves with our own creaturely 8 i cor 1 24 19 bk viii 3 li the trinity nature in order that we might be able to apprehend and per ceive the invisible things of god through the things that are made 20 and now the time has come when after this exercise of our understanding in a lower sphere for so long as need required and maybe for longer we would lift ourselves up to perceive the supreme trinity which is god yet our strength fails us many trinities we can see most surely there are those which are produced by the action of bodily objects on the outward senses and those which occur when the sense perception be comes matter of thought there are trinities when things arising in the mind apart from the bodily senses are distinguished by clear reasoning and comprehended in knowledge such as our faith and those virtues which are ways of living there are trinities when the mind itself by which w e know all that we truthfully claim to know is known to itself or thinks of itself or when it perceives an eternal and unchanging object other than itself in all these processes we see tnnities with assurance since they occur or exist in us as we remember regard and will but can we perceive therein by an act of understanding a speaker and his word the father and the son and proceeding thence the charity common to both which is the holy spirit it may be urged that while trinities belonging to the sphere of sense or mind are for us objects of sight rather than belief the fact that god is trinity must be beheved rather than seen if that be so it must follow either that the invisible things of him are nowhere apprehended and perceived by us through the things that are made or that in none of them which we perceive can we perceive the trinity that there is something in that sphere which we may perceive but something also which we are obliged to beheve though unperceived yet the eighth book showed that we do perceive a changeless good other than our selves and the same was indicated in the fourteenth book when we spoke of the wisdom which comes to man from god why then can we not recognize there the trinity it is impossible to maintain that this wisdom which is called god neither under stands nor loves itself and it is patent that where there is no knowledge there cannot possibly be wisdom that the wisdom which is god knows or loves other things but neither knows nor loves itself cannot be asserted or believed without foolishness and impiety and if so here surely is trinity wisdom its know ledge of itself and its love of itself that was how we discovered 20 rom 1 20 138 augustine later works a trinity in man the mind the knowledge whereby it knows itself and the love whereby it loves itself ii vii but these three are in man without by themselves constituting man for if we follow the definition of the ancients man is a rational and mortal animal the three things named are then man’s highest part but not by themselves man more over the one person which is the individual man possesses those three in his mind even if we adopt a different definition of man to the effect that he is a rational substance composed of soul and body it remains indubitable that man possesses a soul which is not body and a body which is not soul and then our triad is not equivalent to man but belongs to man or is in man if we set aside the body and think of the soul alone we find that the mind is a part of it as it might be its head or eye or face though we may not think of the soul’s parts as bodies thus it is not the soul but the highest thing in it which we call the mind but we cannot say that the trinity is in god in this manner a part of god but not itself god the individual man who is called the image of god not in respect of all that belongs to his nature but in respect of his mind alone is a personal unity having the image of the trinity in his mind but the trinity of whom he is image is as a whole nothing but god is as a whole nothing but trinity nothing belongs to god’s nature that does not belong to this ttrimty the three persons are of one essence not like the individual man one person la in another respect also there is a wide difference to be noted in man whether we speak of mind its knowledge and its love or of memory understanding and will nothing in the mind is remembered but through memory or understood but through understanding or loved but through will in the divine trinity reverence forbids us to say that the father understands neither himself nor his son nor the holy spirit save through the son nor loves save through the holy spirit or that through himself he does no more than remember either himself or the son or the holy spirit or similarly that the son remembers himself and the father only through the father and loves only through the holy spirit while through himself he can only understand both father and himself and holy spirit or in the same way that it is through the father that the holy spirit remembers father son and himself through the son that he understands father son and himself while through himself he can only love himself the father and the son this would amount to saying that the father is memory of himself son the trinity 139 and holy spirit the son is understanding of himself father and holy spirit the holy spirit is charity to himself father and son but to hold or express such opinions concerning the divine trinity would be extreme presumption if only the son understands for himself and father and holy spirit we are back in the irrational notion that the father is wise not of him self but by the son that wisdom has not begotten wisdom but the father is called wise in virtue of the wisdom he has begotten for where understanding is lacking there can be no wisdom if the father understands not for himself but the son for the father clearly the son makes the father wise and if for god to be is to be wise and his essence is his wisdom it will not be the son who has his essence from the father as he truly does but the father who has his essence from the son which is entirely irrational and fake we may be satisfied with our dis cussion refutation and rejection of this irrationality in the seventh book god the father is wise by that same wisdom which is his own being and the son is the wisdom of the father as being derived from the wisdom which is identical with the father of whom he is begotten and accordingly the father is understanding by the same understanding which is his own being for wisdom implies understanding and the son is the understanding of the father as begotten of the understanding which is the father’s being the same may properly be said of memory he who remembers nothing or does not remember himself cannot be wise since therefore the father is wisdom and the son is wisdom the son will remember himself no less than the father remembers himself and just as the father remembers himself and the son with a memory that is his own and not the son’s the son will remember himself and the father with a memory that is not the father’s but his own finally we cannot predicate wisdom where there is no love from which it follows that the father is his own love no less than his own understanding and his own memory we seem forced to the conclusion that our triad of memory under standing and love or will in that supreme and changeless essence that is god are not to be identified with father son and holy spirit but with the father by himself and because the son is wisdom begotten of wisdom it is equally true that he understands for himself and not the father or the holy spirit for him and that neither does the father remember nor the holy spirit love for him but he does both for himself for he is his own memory his own understanding his own love though augustine later works 140 that pioperty comes to him from the father of whom he is be gotten again since the holy spirit is wisdom proceeding from wisdom it is not true that the memory which belongs to him is the father the understanding the son and the love himself for he would not be wisdom if another remembered for him and another understood for him while for himself he did no more than love all three belong to him and in such a manner that he ts all three but this property comes to him from that source from which he proceeds 13 no man can comprehend the wisdom by which god knows all things a wisdom wherein that which we call past does not pass and that which we call future is not awaited as though not yet available but both past and future are all together pre sent with what is present a wisdom wherein there is no thinlang on particular things severally or movement of thought from one thing to another but the whole universe is presented simultaneously in one single view no man i say can compre hend such a wisdom which is both foresight and knowledge inasmuch as even our own wisdom passes our comprehension we can perceive in various ways what is present to our senses or our understanding what is absent but was once present we know by memory if we have not forgotten it we conjecture not the past from the future but the future from the past though we cannot have certain knowledge of it to some of our thoughts we look forward with a degree of clearness and assur ance as about to occur in the immediate future but when we do so with the maximum of security we do it by an act of memory which is evidently concerned not with what is going to happen but with what is past this is open to experience in the case of speeches or songs which we render from memory in a certain order did we not foresee in thought what comes next we could not speak it but what enables us to foresee is not pre vision but memory until the whole speech or song is ended there is nothing in its recitation that was not foreseen and looked for ward to yet in the process our singing and speaking is not ascribed to pre vision but to memory and we remark in those who display exceptional powers of such extended recitation a strength not of foresight but of memory we know without any doubt that such processes are carried on in our mind or by our mind but the more closely we try to observe the manner of the process the more surely does description fail us and effort exhaust itself in the attempt to reach lucidity of understanding if not of language can we expect then that our feeble minds will the trinity i4i be able to comprehend the identity of god’s pro idence with his memory and understanding the proxidence of god who does not regard each thing severally in discursive thought but embraces all that he knows in one eternal changeless and in effable vision in the strait of such perplexity we may xvell cry out to the living god trom myself thy knowledge has become wonderful its strength is shown and i shall not be able to reach it for from myself i understand how man ellous and incom prehensible is thy knowledge whereby thou hast made me and yet in my meditation the fire is kindled so that i seek thy face evermore 22 14 viii i know that wisdom is an incorporeal substance a light in which are seen things not seen by the eye of flesh and yet a man of such spiritual greatness as paul says that we see now through a mirror in an enigma but then face to face 3 if we ask of what manner or of what nature is this mirror we think immediately of the fact that in a mirror what is seen is no more than an image what we have tried to do is to gain through this image which is ourselves some vision as through a mirror of him who made us we find the same sense in other words of the apostle’s we with unveiled face beholding in a mirror the glory of the lord are transformed into the same image from glory unto glory as by the spirit of the lord 24 the word speculantes means seeing in a mirror not observ ing from a watch tower as is clear in the original greek in which the speculum that reflects an image is described by a quite different sounding word from the specula or height from the top of which we look out at distant objects and it is plain enough that speculantes in the phrase gloriam domini speculantes is de rived from speculum and not specula the words transformed into the same image refer to the image of god the same that is that very image which we behold m the mirror for this same image is also the glory of god as paul says elsewhere the man ought not to veil his head since he is the image and glory of god 2 6 a text which we discussed in the twelfth book we are transformed that is we are changed from one form into another from a form of obscurity into a form of clear light 21 ps 139.6 22 ps 39 3 105 4 23 i cor 13 12 24 ii cor 3 18 25 augustine is probably right in agreeing here with a v and r.v mg against r v text reflecting for a discussion of the text cf kirk the vision of gody pp 102 ff 2 s i cor 1 1.7 142 augustine later works even in obscurity the form is god’s image and if his image then assuredly his glory wherein we were created as men ex celling all other animals for of human nature itself it is said that a man ought not to veil his head since he is the image and glory of god and it is this nature the most excellent of things created which when justified by its creator from its ungod liness is brought over from a form that is deformed into a form of perfect beauty for even in its very ungodliness the more severe our condemnation of its fault the more unhesitating must be our appreciation of its natural dignity hence fhe addition of the words from glory into glory from the glory of creation into the glory of justification another interpretation of these words is indeed possible they may mean from the glory of faith into the glory of sight from that glory in which we are the sons of god into that glory in which we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is finally the words as from the spirit of the lord indicate that the blessing of a transforma tion so devoutly to be prayed for is granted to us by the grace of god 15 ix these remarks have been suggested by the apostle’s saying that we see now through a glass the words which follow in an enigma demand for their understanding some acquaintance with writers who have treated of the modes of expression called by the greeks tropes we ourselves use this greek word on occasion in place of the latin modes just as we commonly speak of schemata rather than jigurae the names of the several modes or tropes are very dilrcult to render in latin appropriately to each particular case without recourse to very unfamiliar terms hence certain of our translators to avoid using the greek word for the apostle’s phrase which things are in an allegory 27 have employed the circumlocu tion which stand as signifying one thing by another of this particular trope the allegory there are a number of kinds among which is the so called enigma the definition of the general term must of course cover all the kinds or species which it includes thus as every horse is an animal but not every animal a horse so every enigma is an allegory but not every allegory an enigma the allegory is simply a trope in which one term is used to mean another as for example in this passage from the epistle to the thessalonians therefore let us not slumber as others do but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunken are 27 gal 4 24 the trinity 143 drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober this allegory is not an enigma for the meaning lies to hand for all but the slowest wits the enigma may be shortly des cribed as an obscure allegory such as the leech had three daughters and the like where the apostle speaks of an allegory he is applying the term not to a phrase but to a fact for he shows that the two testaments are signified by the two sons of abraham one of a bondmaid and the other of a free woman a matter not of words but of history but before his exposition of it it remained obscure and therefore such an ex ample included under the general name of allegory might also have the special name of enigma 16 however it is not only people ignorant of literary dis course on the varieties of tropes who may question the meaning of the apostle’s saying that now we see in an enigma the more instructed may still want to know what is the emgma wherein we now see we must look therefore for a smgle meaning con veyed in both parts of the sentence in the words we see now through a mirror and the addition in an enigma it seems to me that as the word mirror was intended to signify an image so the word enigma was meant to stand for a simili tude but one that is obscure and hard to discern if then under the names of mirror and enigma we may understand the apostle to have expressed the notion of certain similitudes adapted for our understanding of god in the manner in which such understanding is possible it remains true that the simih tude best adapted for that purpose will be that which deserves to be called his image there need be no surprise that in the manner of seeing permitted us in this life through a mirror in an enigma our struggle to see at all must be a hard one if vision were easy the word enigma would not be in place the greater enigma lies in our not seeing that of which we cannot be without the vision can any man not see his own thought and can any man see his own thought i do not mean with his bodily eyes but by an actual inward vision both not seeing and seeing are unimaginable for thought is a kind of vision of the mind whether in presence of the objects seen by the bodily eyes or felt by the other senses or in their absence when their likenesses are perceived by thought and the same may be said when the object of thought is noting of the kind neither bodily things nor their hkenesses but such ideas as those of moral qualities or of thought itself the subjects of the sciences or 28 ithess 5.6 ff 29 prov 30.15 144 augustine later works liberal arts or their higher causes and principles in the eternal world or even notions of evil vanity and falsehood held in the mind either without approval or with an approval inspired by error 17 x we are now concerned with that which is object of our thought or matter of our knowing though we may not be thinking of it whether it belong to the contemplative faculty which i have argued should properly be called wisdom or to the active which i would distinguish as knowledge both are at the same time faculties of the one mind the one image of god yet when we are dealing with the lower faculty taken by itself it is not to be called the image of god although even then there is to be found in it a certain likeness of the divine trinity this we demonstrated in the thirteenth book we speak now of the whole range of human knowledge in which we know all that is known to us which must be true or it could not be known no one can know what is false except in the sense of knowing its falsity and if that is known the knowledge is true inasmuch as it is the truth that the thing is false we are dealing now with that of which we think as known and which is known to us even if we are not thinking of it undoubtedly if we would speak of it we can only do so after thinking of it for though no audible words be used whoever thinks must be speaking in his heart so we read in the book of wisdom they have said in them selves thinking amiss where said in themselves is ex plained by the addition of the word thinking there is a similar passage in the gospel where certain scribes on hearing the lord’s word to the paralytic son be of good cheer thy sms are forgiven thee said within themselves this man blasphemeth said within themselves can only mean in thought and the passage continues and when jesus had seen their thoughts he said why think ye evil in your hearts 3 i so in matthew’s account luke tells the same story as follows the scribes and pharisees began to think saying who is this that speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god only but when jesus knew their thoughts he answered and said unto them what do ye think in your hearts 2 here the words they thought saying is equivalent to the expression they said thinking in the book of wisdom in both places we are told that men speak within themselves and in their heart that is speak by thinking they spoke within themselves and were asked what is it that ye think again of the rich man 30 wisdom 2 1 31 matt 9 2 ff 32 luke 5 21 ff the trinity 145 whose field brought forth plentifully our lord himself says he thought within himself saying 3 18 thus certain thoughts are locutions of the heart which has its own mouth according to our lord’s saying not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man but that which cometh forth from the mouth this defileth the man in this one sentence he speaks of two mouths in a man one of the body the other of the heart what his hearers supposed to cause de filement enters into the body’s mouth that by which our lord says that a man is defiled comes forth from the mouth of the heart so runs his own explanation of his saying given personally to his disciples are ye still without understanding do ye not understand that whatsoever entereth into the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the draught here the mouth is plainly that of the body but the next words point to a mouth of the heart but the things which come forth from the mouth proceed from the heart and they defile the man for from the heart proceed evil thoughts etc the exposition could not be clearer yet when we say that thoughts are locutions of the heart we are not denying that they are also visions arising when they are true from visions of things known in the external sphere of bodily activity locution is one thing and vision an other but in the inward realm of our thoughts both are one and the same hearing and sight are two different functions of the bodily sense but in the mind there is no difference between seeing and hearing that is why although outward speech is not seen but heard the holy gospel can speak of the inward locutions which are thoughts as seen by our lord and not heard they said within themselves this man blasphemeth and then when jesus saw their thoughts he saw what they had said saw in his own thought their thoughts which they sup posed visible to themselves alone 19 it is possible therefore to understand the meaning of a word not only before it is uttered aloud but even before the images of its uttered sounds are rehearsed in thought for there is a word which belongs to no tongue to none that is of the tongues of the peoples of which our latin language is one any man that can understand this unspoken word can see through this mirror and in this enigma a certain hkeness of that word of which it is written in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god 5 when we speak the truth that is say what we know there must 33 luke 12 17 34 matt 15 10 ff ssjohn i:x 146 augustine later works be born out of the knowledge held in our memory a word which corresponds in all respects to the knowledge of which it is born the thought which has received form from the object of our knowledge is the word spoken in our heart a word that is neither greek nor latin nor of any other tongue only when we need to convey it to the knowledge of those to whom we speak do we employ some token by which to signify it usually a sound but sometimes a gesture is presented either to ear or eye in order that by means of bodily tokens the word carried in our mind may be made known to the bodily senses what indeed is beckoning but a kind of visible speech we can quote holy scripture to the same purpose where we read in john’s gospel verily verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me his disciples therefore looked upon one an other doubting of whom he might speak there was one of his disciples leaning upon jesus bosom whom jesus loved simon peter therefore beckoned unto him saying who is it of whom he speaks the beckoning of peter says what he did not dare say aloud these and the like bodily tokens we apply to the ears or eyes of persons present and conversing with us but we have also invented letters to enable us to converse with the absent letters being tokens of uttered sounds whereas the uttered sounds themselves are tokens in our speaking of the realities of which we think 20 xi accordingly the word in its outward sounding is sign of the word that is inwardly luminous and to this latter the name of word more properly belongs what the mouth of flesh emits is the word’s utterance which itself is called word on account of that by which it is assumed for outward exposure we may compare the manner in which our own word is made as it were a bodily utterance through assuming that utterance as a means of displaying itself to men’s senses with that in which the word of god was made flesh through assuming that flesh as a means of displaying himself to men’s senses even as our word is made utterance yet not changed into utterance so the word of god was made flesh but most assuredly not changed into flesh our word is made utterance the divine word flesh by an assumption of the outward form and not by a consump tion of itself and a passing into the other he therefore who de sires to arrive at some sort of likeness unlike as it must be at many points of the word of god should not regard the human word that sounds upon the ear either m its vocal utterance or 36 john 13 21 if the trinity 147 in the unspoken thinking of it the words of every audible lan guage may also be thought upon without speech poems may be repeated mentally while the bodily mouth remains silent not only the series of syllables but the notes of tunes material as they are and addressed to the material sense which we call hearing may be presented through their material images to the thinking mind which rehearses them all in silence we must go beyond all this to arrive at that human word which may furnish some small measure of likeness for the beholding as in an enigma of the word of god we speak here not of that word which came to one or another of die prophets of which it is said that the word of god grew and was multiplied 37 or again that faith comes of hearing and hearing through the word of christ or again when ye received from us the word of the hearing of god ye received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god 3 the scriptures contain countless sayings of the kind concerning the word of god which is spread abroad in many different tongues through the hearts and mouths of men it is called god’s word as delivering a doctrine that is divine and not human the word of god of which now we seek to gain some scanty vision by way of this likeness is that of which it is written that the word was god that all things were made by him that the word was made flesh that a fountain of wisdom is the word of god in the highest we must arrive at that human word which is the word of a reasonable creature the word of an image of god not born of god but made by him a word neither producing itself in sound nor object of thought in a likeness of sound such as must needs belong to a particular language but the word that precedes all the tokens by which it is signified and is be gotten of the knowledge which remains in the mind in the moment when that knowledge is spoken inwardly and with truth to itself the vision of thought is very like the vision of knowledge when the word is spoken aloud or by means of any bodily token it is not spoken as it truly is but in the manner in which it may be seen or heard through the medium of the body thus when the word’s content is the same as the content of knowledge it is then a true word the truth that is expected of a man wherein that which is in his knowledge is also in his word and what is not in the one is not in the other by this we recognize his yea yea and his nay nay and so the 37 acts 6.7 38 rom 10 17 39 i thess 2 13 40 john 1 1 3 14 ecclesiasticxis i 5 4i matt 5 37 augustine later works 148 likeness of the created image approaches as nearly as it may to that likeness of the image begotten by which god the son is declared like his father in all things according to substance there is a further likeness to the word of god which we may observe in this enigma it is said of the divine word that au things were made through him 42 god is asserted to have created the universe through his only begotten word so in the works of man there are none that are not first spoken in the heart and hence it is written that the beginning of every work is a word 3 but here also there is beginning of a good work only when the word is a true word and the word is true when it is begotten of the knowledge of good working here too the rule is yea yea and nay nay if yea stands in the knowledge whereby men should live it must be also in the word through which man must work if nay is there then nay must be here also else such a word will be a lie and not the truth and from it proceed sin and no right working yet another likeness of god’s word may be seen in this like ness of our human word in that a word of ours can be without a work following while there can be no work without the pre ceding word in like manner the word of god was able to be apart from the existence of any creature but there could be no creature save through that word through whom all things were made and accordingly it was not god the father nor the holy spirit nor the trinity itself but only the son the word of god that was made flesh although the making was act of the whole trinity for the purpose was that we might live aright by our word following the pattern of his example which means that in our word whether in contemplation or in work ing there be no manner of lie but that is the perfection of the image sometime to be for the attaining of it we have the in struction of a good master in christian faith and teaching of godliness to the end that with unveiled face removing the veil of the law which is shadow of things to come beholding in a mirror the glory of the lord we may be transformed into the same image from glory unto glory even as from the spirit of the lord 4 according to the exposition of this text which was given above 21 and when by that transformation the image in us will have been renewed unto perfection we shall be like god for we shall see him not through a mirror but as he is 45 in the apostle’s words face to face 42 john 1 3 43 ecclesiasticus 37 16 ixx 44 ii cor 3.18 45 i john 3 2 the trinity h9 but for our present state in this mirror this enigma this feeble trace of likeness there remains a degree of unlikeness not easy for man to measure still i will do what i can to suggest some few points in which the difference can be observed xii in the first place the knowledge itself from which our thought takes a form of truth when we say what we know must even for the most expert and learned of men be poor and scanty indeed we need not dwell on what the mind receives from the bodily senses in which the differences between appearance and reality are so many that a madman may think himself sane in reliance on the plausibility of his sensations hence the pre valence of the academic philosophy whose universal doubt was a madness even more pitiable but apart from the mind’s dependence on the senses how few things remain which we know as surely as we know that we are alive there at least we need not fear to be deceived by the plausibility of appearance since it is certam that he who is deceived is alive and this assur ance does not come to us in the way of impressions from the outer world in it there can be no optical illusion as when the oar in water appears as broken towers on the land seem to men on shipboard to be in motion and in so many other cases of dif ference between appearance and reality here it is not the eye of flesh whereby we see we know that we are alive by an interior knowledge which cannot be touched by the suggestion of the academic that we may be asleep without knowing it and dream that we see we all know that things seen by the dreamer are much hke those seen by the waking man but certainty in the knowledge of living leads a man to say not t know that i am awake but i know that i am alive whether asleep or awake he is living in that knowledge he cannot be deceived by dreams for it takes a living man both to sleep and to dream nor can the academic dispute that knowledge by saying you may perhaps be mad without knowing it for there is httle dif ference between the impressions of madness and those of san ity the madman must be alive and the reply to the academic is not i know that i am not mad but know that i am alive thus the claim to know that one is alive can never be convicted of illusion or falsity any number of deceptive im pressions of au kinds may be urged against it but he who makes 46 the sceptical school to which augustme himself was inclined for a time after his rejection of mamcheamsm conj vi 19 x and which he set himself to refute after his conversion m the contra academicos cx de tnn x 14 x augustine later works 150 the claim will remain entirely unmoved since no man can be deceived who is not alive nevertheless if human knowledge includes no more than certainties of this kind they are indeed few though it may be possible to multiply them in each class so that instead of being few they are found to run to infinity thus the assertion t know that i am alive is the assertion of a single item of know ledge but if one adds t know that i know that i am alive we already have two and knowing that these two are known makes a third and we can proceed in the same way to add a fourth and a fifth or as many as we will since however it is im possible either to comprehend an innumerable number by the addition of units or to express it without numeration we can at least comprehend and express with complete certainty the fact that this knowledge is both true and innumerable in the sense that its infinite number of items can truly be neither compre hended nor expressed and we can note the same fact in regard to certainty of will to the man who says t wish to be happy you cannot have the face to retort perhaps you are deceived and if he goes on to say t know that this is my wish and i know that i know it he can add to these two items his know ledge of them to make a third and a fourth that he knows he knows those two and so on to infinity again take the assertion t do not wish to be mistaken whether the asserter is mis taken or not it will still be true that he does not want to be mistaken and no one could have the face to reply perhaps you are deceived seeing that in whatever other matter he may be deceived he is not deceived about his unwillingness to be deceived and if he says that he knows this he can add any number of items known clearly extensible to infinity i do not wish to be deceived i know that i do not wish it and i know that i know it however awkward the expression the num ber of such knowables can be shown to be infinite there are other conclusive arguments against the academic contention that nothing can be known by man but we must dwell on the point no longer as it is not the purpose of our present work we may refer to the three books written soon after our conversion those who are able and willing to read them and to read with understanding will be disturbed by none of the various argu ments alleged by the academics against our apprehension of truth of things known there are two kinds the one of those 47 the contra academicos m retract i i augustine tells us that he wrote this work to clear his own mind of scepticism cf above 2 1 xii n the trinity things which the mind apprehends through the bodily senses the other of what it apprehends through itself these philo sophers have been voluble in depreciation of the bodily senses but they have failed altogether to cast doubt upon certain un shakable perceptions of truth which the mind reaches through itself such as the judgment i have instanced that i know that i am alive yet we are by no means to doubt the truth of what the bodily senses have taught us for through them we have come to know heaven and earth and all that therein is known to us in the measure in which he who has created us and them has willed that we should know them nor may we deny our knowledge of what we have learnt on the testimony of others else we should be ignorant of the ocean ignorant of the exist ence of lands and cities of which common report assures us ignorant of the past history of men and their works ignorant of all the events of which news comes to us every day from all parts confirmed by the agreement and support of other in formation ignorant finally of the places or the men from whom we have our own origin all these things we have believed on the testimony of others and if it be absurd to pretend such ignorance we must admit that the bodily senses not only of ourselves but of strangers have made great additions to our knowledge 2 2 all such knowledge in the mind of man whether acquired through the mind itself or through his bodily senses or by the testimony of others is preserved in the store chamber of mem ory and from it is begotten a true word when we speak what we know but this word exists before any sound before any imagining of a sound for in that state the word has the closest likeness to the thing known of which it is offspring and image from the vision which is knowledge arises a vision which is thought a word of no language a true word born of a true thing having nothing of its own but all from that knowledge of which it is born it matters not when it was learnt by the man who speaks what he knows sometimes the speaking may im mediately follow the learning it will still be true if it arises from things known xiii but when we think of god the father of whom is begotten the word that is god of god can we suppose that the wisdom which is his own underived being has been learnt in part through a bodily sense and in part through himself that would be to think of god as a rational animal not as above the rational soul but only thus can he be thought of by us men 152 augustine later works higher than all animals and all souls though seen only through a mirror divined in an enigma not yet face to face as he is of god the father we cannot say that what he knows not through the body for he has none but through himself he has learnt of any other source or has stood in need of messengers or wit nesses for the knowledge of it his own perfection suffices him for the knowledge of all that he knows messengers indeed he has in the angels but not to bring him news of what he does not know for no such thing exists the angels fulfil their being in taking counsel of his truth for their own works and when they are said to be messengers to him of anything it is not that he may learn of them but that they may learn of him through his word with no material sound they are messengers of his will sent by him to whom he wills having all their hearing of him through that his word which means finding in his truth what they must do the substance the destination and the times of their messages we too make our prayers to him yet do not instruct him of our needs tor your father knoweth as his word has said what is needful for you before ye ask of him 48 nor has he learnt the knowledge of this at any point in time all that was to be in time what and when we were to ask of him to whose asking and to what requests he should hearken or not hearken were known to him beforehand without any begin ning of all his creatures both spiritual and material his know ledge is not consequent on their existence but their existence consequent on his knowledge he was never m ignorance of what he was to create he created therefore because he knew he did not know because he created nor was his knowledge of them as created different from his knowledge of them as to be created for their being added nothing to his wisdom which stood fast as it ever was while they came into being as it be hoved them and when it behoved them so it is written in the book of ecclesiasticus all things were known unto him before they were created even so as after they were finished 49 even so not otherwise both before they were created and after they were finished even so were they known to him from that knowledge therefore our own knowledge is widely dif ferent what is knowledge in god is at the same time wisdom and what is wisdom is at the same time essence or substance for in the marvellous simplicity of the divine nature to be wise and to be are not different things what constitutes wisdom itself constitutes being as we have constantly maintained in 48 malt 6 8 49 ecclesiasticus 23 20 the trinity 153 dous books 50 whereas our own knowledge in many matters ubject to loss and acquisition since in us there is no identity being and knowledge or wisdom we may still have being lugh we are ignorant or lacking in understanding of what we e learnt from external sources for this reason the unlike s of our knowledge to the knowledge of god is paralleled by unlikeness of the word in us which is born of our knowledge the word of god that is begotten of the father’s essence ich is as much as to say of the father’s knowledge or of the ther’s wisdom or to express it more adequately of the father o is knowledge the father who is wisdom 3 xiv thus the word who is god the father’s only gotten son in all things like and equal to the father god of d light of light wisdom of wisdom essence of essence lt word is entirely what the father is though he is not the ther since this is son and that is father so he knows all that father knows but his knowledge hke his being is from the ther for kno ving and being here are one whereas the ther’s knowledge no more than his being is derived from son the father’s begetting of the word equal to himself all things is a kind of speaking of himself he would not vc spoken himself wholly and perfectly if there were less or ire in his word than in himself here we see the supreme tlization of yea yea nay nay so that this word is truly th itself for he contains all that is in that knowledge of ich he is begotten and nothing that is not in it there can 7ct in this word be any falsity since he disposes himself im itably as the father disposes himself from whom he is the cl can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father ing 51 this inability is true ability not weakness but the ength whereby truth is unable to be false so the father ows au things both in himself and in the son but in himself knows au things as himself in the son as his word springing m all that is in himself in like manner the son knows all ngs in himself as what is born of that which the father ows in himself and in the father as that of which is born that the son knows in himself thus father and son know e another the one by begetting the other by being begotten that is in their knowledge their wisdom their essence is n by each of them in a single act with no separation into rts or units as though the sight should move from one point another and back again or transfer itself from this or that e g de tnn vi 8 vii see introduction p 21 si john 5 19 154 augustine later works point to others in succession unable to see one without losing others from view all i say are seen together and of them all there is nothing that is not always in sight 24 we have seen that there is in ourselves a word that has no sound uttered or imagined but belongs to a reality of in ward vision and inward utterance and therefore not to any spoken language hence there is in this enigma a kind of likeness to the word of god which is also god inasmuch as this word is born of our knowledge as god’s word is born of the father’s but in this word of ours so recognized as having a certain likeness to god’s it must not irk us to observe and describe as fairly as we may the many elements of unlikeness xv first can we say that the word in us is born only of our knowledge do we not say many things that we do not know and not doubtfully but in the belief that they are true if they happen to be true the truth will lie in the things of which we speak and not in our own word for there is no true word that is not begotten of a thing known in this way our word may be false not through our lying but through our mis taking when we are in doubt the word is derived not from the thing of which we doubt but from the doubt itself we may not know whether that of which we doubt is true but we know that we doubt and therefore when we say so the word is true for we are saying what we know again we may lie in which case our word is wilfully and knowingly false whereas the true word is that we are lying for that is what we know and when we confess a he we speak the truth for we are saying what we know which is that we have lied but that word which is god and more powerful than us has no power so to do for he can do noth ing but what he seeth the father doing and he speaks not from himself but has from the father all that he speaks since he himself is spoken by the father alone the high power of that word is to have no power to lie in him there is no yea and nay but yea yea and nay nay it may be objected that what is not true ought not to be called a word and to that i wilhngly agree but even when our word is true and so rightly called a word can we say that as it may be called vision from vision or knowledge from knowledge it can also be called essence from essence even as the word of god is chiefly and most rightly so called it cannot because in us being and know ing are not identical we know many things which have through our memory of them a kind of life and when we forget them a kind of death thus when they are no longer in our knowledge the trinity 155 yet we still exist and when our knowledge has slipped from the mind and so perished for us yet we are still alive 25 there are indeed items of knowledge which cannot be lost since their presence belongs to the nature of the mind itself as for example the knowledge that we are alive which must continue as long as the mind continues and that means for ever but this and any similar kind of knowledge in which we may especially look for the image of god though always known is not always object of thought since the word in us is spoken by thinking it is not easy to see how the word of such knowledge can be called everlasting the mind’s hfe and the mind’s know ledge that it lives are both everlasting but its thinking of its life or of the knowledge of its life is not since in passing from one thought to another it will cease to think of the former although it will not cease to know it if then any everlasting knowledge can exist m the mind but an everlasting thought of that know ledge cannot and if the true inward word in us is spoken only when we think it follows that god alone may be understood to possess a word that is everlasting and co eternal with himself it may be suggested that a word as unbroken as the knowledge is to be found in the mere possibility of thought in the fact that what is known is always potentially object of a true thought even when it is not actually being thought of but what has not yet taken form in the mental vision is not in the proper sense a word it cannot present a likeness to the knowledge of which it is born if it has not the form of that knowledge and is only called a word as having such form potentially we might as well say that it should be called a word because it is one potentially but what ts this potential word that claims the name of word what is this thing capable of form but still un formed but a process in our mind darting hither and thither with a kind of movement of passage as we turn our thought from one object to another in the course of discovery or pre sentation it becomes a true word only when what i have called this darting movement of passage comes upon what we know and takes form from it receiving its likeness at every point so that the mode of thought correspond to the mode of knowledge and its object be spoken in the heart without voice uttered or imagined such as must belong to a particular 52 we are reminded here of augustme’s assertion that memory imderstand ing and will are always present in the mind even if below the level of con sciousness cf above x 1 9 xii n the fouowmg discussion brings out the difficulties of the conception with regard to understanding 156 augustine later works language we may allow to avoid the appearance of verbal con troversy that the mental process capable of taking form from our knowledge may be called a word even before the form is taken as being so to say formable but who can fail to see the unlikeness herein to that word of god which is in the form of god not in the sense of having been first formable and later formed or able at any time to be without form but as being a form incomposite and equal without composition to him from whom it is derived and with whom it is in marvellous wise co eternal we speak therefore of the word of god but not of god’s thinking in order to exclude the notion of any passing process in god now receiving form and now regaining it in order to become a word capable therefore of losing its form and passing through some unstable condition of formlessness that great master of language vergil knew well the value of words with a sure insight into the nature of thought when he wrote in his poem passes within himself the varied happenings of war 53 which simply means thinks that is why the son of god is not called god’s thought but god’s word our own thought becomes our true word when it arrives at what we know and takes form from it the word of god must be understood apart from any thought of god as a form in itself incomposile de pending on no formable state that may as well lack form as have it the scriptures do indeed speak of thoughts of god but only by the same mode of expression which also speaks of god’s forgetting of which assuredly there can in strictness be none in god 26 recognizing then so great an unlikeness to god and his word in this enigma as it now is despite the measure of hke ness we have found in it we must admit that even when w e shall be like him when we shall see him as he is 54 words clearly implying awareness of our present unlikeness we shall yet have no natural equality with him for the created nature must always be less than the creator then indeed our word will not be false for we shall neither lie nor be mistaken per haps there will be no passage in our thoughts of movement and return from one thing to another but we shall see all our know ledge in one simultaneous view yet even in that state if we reach it the creature that was once formable will have achieved 53 verg aen x 159 f 54 i john 3 2 the trinity 57 formation indeed in such wise that nothing will be lacldng to its destined form but still it cannot be reckoned equal to that incomposite being in which there is nothing formed or re formed that once was formable but pure form an eternal and immutable substance neither formless nor formed 27 xvii concerning the father and the son we have now said as much as we have found possible to discern by means of the mirror and enigma of our human mind it remains for us to consider with such insight as god’s gift may grant us the holy spirit scripture teaches us that he is the spirit neither of the father alone nor of the son alone but of both and so his being suggests to us that mutual charity whereby the fathei and the son love one another but for the exercise of our under standing the inspired word has set before us truths not lying on the surface but to be explored in the depths and thence brought up to light so that our search calls for the greater diligence the scripture has not said the holy spirit is charity if it had much of our enquiry would have been foreclosed it has said god is charity 55 and so left us to ask whether god the father be charity or god the son or god the holy spirit or god the trinity itself now it is not open to us to say that god is called charity not because charity is a substantive reality worthy to be named god but because it is god’s gift in this latter manner when god is addressed in scripture in such terms as fthou art my patience the meaning is not that our patience is the substance of god but that it comes to us from him as indeed we read elsewhere from him is my patience 5 7 but this interpretation is at once refuted by the actual lan guage of the scriptures thou art my patience is like thou lord art my hope and my god is my compassion 59 and many expressions of the kind but we do not read the lord is my charity or thou art my charity or god is my charity but god is charity just as god is a spirit anyone who cannot see the difference must seek understanding from the lord and not explanation from us for we have no words to make the point more evident 28 god then is charity our question is whether this be speaks father or son or holy spirit or the trinity itself which is not three gods but one god i have argued earlier in the present book that the divine trinity must not be so conceived from the likeness of the three members displayed in our mental 55 i john 4 16 56 ps 71 5 57 ps 62 5 58 ps 91 9 59 ps 59 17 158 augustine later works trinityj as to make the father memory of all three the son understanding of all three and the holy spirit charity of all three it is not as though the father neither understood nor loved for himself but the son understood for him and the holy spirit loved for him while he himself did nothing but re member both for himself and for them nor as though the son neither remembered nor loved for himself but the father remembered for him and the holy spirit loved for him while he himself did nothing but understand both for himself and for them nor as though the holy spirit neither remembered nor understood for himself but the father remembered for him and the son understood for him while he himself only loved both for himself and for them rather must we think that all and each possess all three characters in their proper nature and that in them the three are not separate as in ourselves memory is one thing understanding another and love or charity another but that there is one single potency for them all such as wisdom itself so possessed in the nature of each several person that he who possesses it is that which he possesses i.e the form of a changeless and incomposite substance if this be understood and its truth manifest so far as we may be suffered to see or to con jecture in these great matters i see no reason why just as father son and holy spirit are each called wisdom and all together are not three wisdoms but one so father son and holy spirit may not each be called charity and all together one charity in the same way the father is god the son is god and the holy spirit god and all together are one god 29 yet there is good reason why in this trinity we call none word of god but the son none gift of god but the holy spirit none of whom the word is begotten and from whom the holy spirit originally proceeds but god the father i add the word originally because we learn that the holy spirit proceeds also from the son o but this is part of what is given by the 0 the doctrine of the double procession of the holy spirit which led to the insertion of the fzhoque clause into the nicene greed was expressly maintained by augustine he argued that it was implied both by the scriptural phrases spirit of the son spirit of christ and by the account in john 20 22 of christ’s insufflation of the spirit upon his dis ciples after the resurrection see e.g in jo ev tr xgix 6 ff quoted by augustine below in bk xv 48 xxvii contra maxim ii xiv i at the same time augustme always insisted as here that the procession of the spirit from the son is part of that which the son receives from the father in his eternal generation there is thus no real difference between his position and the eastern doctrme of the spirit’s procession from the father through the son the trinity 159 father to the son not as already existing without it but given to him as all that the father gives to his only begotten ord in the act of begetting he is begotten in such wise that the com mon gift proceeds from him also and the holy spirit is spint of both and this distinction within the indivisible trinity is not to be admitted in passing but to be observed with all diligence for hence it comes that the word of god is by a special fitness called also the wisdom of god though both father and holy spirit are wisdom if then one of the aree is by a special fitness to be named charity the name falls most appropnately to the holy spirit and this means that in the incomposite and supreme being of god substance is not to be distinguished from chanty but substance is itself charity and charity itself is sub stance whether in the father or in the son or in the holy spirit and yet by a special fitness the holy spirit is named charity 30 we may compare the manner in which all the oracles of the old testament scripture are sometimes denoted by the name of law a text quoted from the prophet isaiah where he says by other tongues and other hps i will speak to this people is introduced by the apostle with the words it is written in the law and our lord himself says it is written in their law that they have hated me without a cause though we read the words in a psalm but sometimes the title is as signed specially to the law given through moses as in the texts the law and the prophets were until john and on these two commandments hang the whole law and the prophets here certainly the law is entitled in its special sense as that coming from mount sinai again under the name of prophets we find the pseilms denoted though elsewhere the saviour himself says it behoved all things to be fulfilled which are written in the law and the prophets and the psalms concerning me here again the name prophets excludes the psalms law then may be used in a general sense to in clude prophets and psalms but also in a special sense of the law given through moses and prophets may be used as a common term including the psalms as well as in a special sense excluding them and there are numerous other instances to show that many names can both be extended generally and also applied in a special sense to certain things but we need not dwell at length on so plain a matter i am concerned only to isa as'ii i cor 14 2 62 john 15 25 ps 35.19 3 matt it 1 3 22.40 luke 24 44 l60 augustine later works rebut the charge of impropriety in calling the holy spirit char ity if made on the ground that both god the father and god the son are entitled to the same name 31 we may say then that just as we give the name of wisdom by a special fit ness to the one word of god though in general both the holy spirit and the father himself are wisdom so is the holy spirit by a special fitness to be called charity though both father and son are charity in general the word of god god’s only begotten son is expressly named as the wisdom of god in the apostle’s own phrase christ the power of god and the wisdom of god but we can also find authority for calling the holy spirit charity by a careful examination of the apostle john’s way of speaking after saying beloved let us love one an other for love is of god he goes on to add and every one that loveth is born of god he that loveth not hath not known god for god is love this makes it plain that the love which he calls god is the same love which he has said to be of god love then is god of or from god but since both son is born and spirit proceeds from god the father we must naturally enquire to which of them applies the saying in this passage that god is love only the father is god without being of god so tliat the love which is god as being of god must be either the son or the holy spirit now in what follows the writer refers to the love of god not that by which we love him but that by which he loved us and sent his son as expiator for our sins and bases thereon his exhortation to us to love one an other that so god may dwell in us since god as he has said is love and there follows at once designed to express the matter more plainly the saying hereby we know that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit thus the holy spirit of whom he has given us makes us dwell in god and god in us but that is the effect of love the holy spirit himself therefore is the god who is love a little further on after repeating his statement that god is love john adds immediately and he that abideth in love abideth in god and god abideth in him which corresponds to the earlier saying hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit it is the spirit therefore who is sig nified in the text god is love god the holy spirit who pro ceeds from god when he is given to man kindles him with the love of god and of neighbour and is himself love for man has 65 1 cor 1.24 65 i john 4 7 ff the trinity l6l no means of loving god unless it comes of god hence the fol lowing saying that sve love him because he first loved us it is the same in the apostle paul the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts through the holy spirit which is given to us 57 32 xviii more excellent gift of god than this there is none it alone divides between the sons of the eternal kingdom and the sons of eternal perdition other favours also are given through the holy spirit but without charity they avail nothing unless the holy spirit be bestowed in such measure on any man as to make him a lover of god and of his neighbour he cannot pass from the left hand to the right the name of gift belongs properly to the spirit only on account of love the love which he that lacks though he speak with the tongues of men and angels is sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal though he have prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge and though he have all faith so as to remove mountains he is nothing and though he distribute all his substance and give his body to be burned it profits him nothing how great a blessing must this be without which blessings so great can bring no man to eternal life but suppose a man that does not speak with tongues has not prophecy knows not au mysteries or all knowledge dis tributes not all his goods to the poor whether because he has none to distribute or because some necessity forbids nor gives his body to be burned if he have no trial of such suffering to face love itself or charity both words mean the same thing if such a man have it will bring him to the kingdom even to faith charity gives all its fruitfuhiess for there may indeed be faith without charity but not a faith that profits so the apostle paul says in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but the faith which worketh through love so distinguishing this faith from that whereby the devils also believe and tremble thus the love which is of god and is god is specially the holy spirit through whom is spread abroad in our hearts the charity of god by which the whole trinity makes its habitation within us and therefore is the holy spirit god though he be most rightly called also the gift of god and what can be the special sense of that gift but 67 rom 5 5 this exegesis of i john ch 4 for which cf in ep jo tr y vii 6 viii 12 is no doubt forced in so far as it attempts to prove an intentional equation of love with the holy spirit but augustine is not mistaken m finding both in john and paul the doctrme that love is the unfailing evidence of the spirit’s presence and working 68 i clor 13 1 ff 69 gal 5 6 70 james 2 19 augustine later works 162 charity which brings us to god and without which no other of god’s ts can bring us to him 33 xix if proof be still awaited that the holy spirit is called in the inspired writings the gift of god we have the words of our lord jesus christ in the gospel according to john if any man thirst let him come to me and drink he that be keveth in me as the scripture saith out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water to which the evangelist adds his com ment and this he said of the spirit which they that believed on him were to receive hence too the saying of the apostle paul and we have all drunk of one spirit 2 it may be asked whether this water which is the holy spirit is actually called the gift of god the answer is that this water found in that place to be the holy spirit is found elsewhere in the same gospel named as god’s gift when our lord was talking at the well with the woman of samaria to whom he had said give me to drink and she answered that the jews had no dealings with the samaritans jesus answered and said unto her if thou hadst known the gift of god and who he is that saith unto thee give me to drink thou mightest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water the woman saith to him lord thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep whence then hast thou hving water jesus answered and said unto her every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again but he that shall drink of the water that i shall give him shall not thirst for evermore but the water that i shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water springing unto eternal life since this hving water according to the evangelist’s ex position is the holy spint no doubt but the spirit is that gift of god of which our lord here says if thou hadst known the gift of god and who he is that saith unto thee give me to drink thou mightest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water the reference in the one passage out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water is the same as in the other shall become in him a fountain of water springing unto eternal life 34 paul the apostle also tells us that to each one of us is given grace according to the measure of the giving of christ and that the giving of christ is the holy spirit is shown by his next words wherefore he saith he ascended on high and led captivity captive and gave gifts to men 74 now we know well 71 john 7 37 ff 72 i cor 12 13 73 john 4 7 ff 74 eph 4 7 f the trinity 163 that our lord jesus after his resurrection from the dead and ascension into heaven gave the holy spirit by whose inspira tion the believers spoke with the tongues of all nations the word gifts instead of gift need not disturb us for it comes in a quotation from the psalm where however we actually read thou hast ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive thou hast received gifts among men xhis is the reading of most manuscripts especially the greek and so we have it as the translation of the hebrew the apostle follows the prophet in using the word gifts and not gift but where the prophet says thou hast received gifts among men the apostle chooses to say gave gifts unto men thus we get the fullest meaning from both texts the prophetic and the apostolic as in both is the authority of the divine word for both are true both that he gave to men and that he received among men gave to men as the head to his members and received among men himself in his members on account of these his members he called from heaven saul saul why persecutest thou me and concerning them he says when ye did it unto one of my uttlest ones ye did it unto me 76 thus christ himself both gave from heaven and received upon earth on the other hand both prophet and apostle have spoken in the plural of gifts because through the one gift which is the holy spirit there is a distribution to the community of all christ’s members of many gifts appropriated to each of them not every individual has all the gifts but these have some and those others though that one gift the holy spirit by whom the rest are severally appor tioned is given to all paul in another passage after mentioning the many gifts says all these worketh one and the same spirit apportioning to every man as he will we find the same thought in tbe epistle to the hebrews god bearing them witness with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and with distributings of the holy spirit 8 in the text from which we started after the quotation he ascended on high led captivity captive and gave gifts to men paul continues that he ascended what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same that 75 ps 68.18 76 acts 9 4 matt 25 40 this principle of exegesis based on the doctrine of the church as christ’s mystical body which augustine used as key to interpretation of the psalms he had learnt from the rides of tyconius the donatist for a possible explanation of paul’s variation from the psalm text see armitage robinson’s commentary on ephesians ad loc 77 i cor 12 11 78 heb 2 4 augustine later works 164 also ascended above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers here we see why gifts were spoken of as paul says elsewhere are all apostles are all prophets and he concludes for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministering unto the building up of the body of chnst that is the house built up as the psalm has it after the captivity for of those who are delivered from the devil by whom they were held captive is built up the house of christ the house which is called the church that captivity has been led captive by the conqueror of the devil who has bound him first with the chains of justice and then with the chains of power that he might not carry with him into eternal punishment those that were to be members of a holy head so is the devil himself signified by the captivity led captive by him who has ascended on high and given gifts to men or received them among men 35 we have also the words of the aposde peter recorded in our canonical acts of the apostles when by his speaking of christ the jews are stirred in their hearts and ask what then shall we do brethren show us he answers repent and be baptized each one of you m the name of jesus christ for the re mission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy spirit in the same book we read how simon magus would have given money to the apostles in order that he might receive from them the power by which through the laying on of his hands the holy spirit should be given it is peter again who answers thy money pensh wisi thee because thou hast thought to possess the gift of god by money in another passage of the acts where peter speaks to cornelius and them that were with him proclaiming and preaching christ the scripture says while peter yet spoke these words the holy spirit fell upon all them that heard the word and the believers of the circum cision that had come with peter were amazed because upon the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy spirit for they heard them speaking with tongues and glorifying god afterwards peter is called to give account to the brethren at jerusalem who were moved at the report of his action in bap tizing men uncircumcised because before they were baptized the holy spirit had come upon them so as to cut away all ground 9 i cor 12 29 eph 4 12 ps 127 1 8 see bk xiii argument si acts 2.37 f s acts 8 18 at ss acts 10.44 at the trinity 165 for questioning and his story ends when i had begun to speak unto them the holy spirit fell upon them as upon us in the beginning and i remembered the word of the lord how that he said john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy spirit if therefore he hath given to them an equal gift as to us who have believed in the lord jesus christ who was i that i should be able to prevent god from giving unto them the holy spirit 6 there are many other scripture texts which agree in their testimony that the holy spirit is the gift of god inasmuch as he is given to them that love god through him but it would be tedious to collect them all and a man not contented by those we have quoted is likely to be content with nothing 36 it may be necessary to point out when the scriptural appellation of the holy spirit as god’s t is recognized that the phrase gift of the holy spirit is a form of expression of the same kind as putting off the body of the flesh just as body of the flesh means no more than the flesh so the t of the holy spirit means no more than the holy spirit he is the gift of god inasmuch as he is given to those to whom he is given in himself he is god though he were given to no man he was god co etemal with father and son before being ven to anyone nor is he a lesser than they because they are givers and he given though given as god’s gift he is as god the giver of himself the spirit who is said to breathe where he listeth cannot be held to lack power over himself similarly the apostle’s words already quoted all these worketh one and the same spirit dividing severally to every man as he will indicate not a subjection of the given and a domination of the givers but a concord of given and givers 37 to sum up holy scripture proclaims that god is charity charity is of god and its effect in us is that w'e dwell in god and he in us this we know because he has given us of his spirit it follows that the spirit himself is the god who is charity if among god’s gifts there is none greater than charity and there is no greater gift of god than the holy spirit we naturally con clude that he who is said to be both god and of god is himself charity and if the charity whereby the father loves the son and the son loves the father displays beyond the power of words the communion of both it is most fitting that the spirit who is common to both should liave the special name of charity the sounder way of faith or of understanding is to hold that s acts ii 15 ff ttciol 2.11 john 3 8 i66 augustine later works while charity in the divine trinity is not the holy spirit alone yet the reasons given justify applying to him this special name so in the trinity it is not he alone that is either spirit or holy since the father is spirit and the son is spirit the father is holy and the son is holy piety allows no doubt of that yet we have reason for calling him in especial the holy spirit because he is common to both he has in especial the name that belongs to both in common if in the trinity the holy spirit alone were charity then the son would be made out to be son not of the father alone but also of the holy spirit countless as are the texts which call him the only begotten son of the father the apostle’s saying concerning god tie father remains true vho hath delivered us from the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of the son of his charity 9 fot here of his son though that would have had the truth of frequent usage but son of his charity if in the trinity there is no charity of god save the holy spirit then the son is son also of the holy spirit that conclusion being absurd the alternative must be accepted that the holy spirit is not charity alone of the trinity but so called especially for the reasons sufficiently set forth the phrase son of his charity means simply his be loved son in fine the son of his substance for that charity of the father that exists in his ineffably incomposite nature is nothing else than his very nature and substance as we have so often said and must not weary of repeating thus the son of his charity is no other than the offspring of his substance 38 xx this shows the foolishness of the arguments of eunomius from whom the eunomian heresy arose he could not understand and would not believe that the only begotten word of god through whom all things were made was the son of god by nature that is born of the father’s substance there fore he maintained that the word was not son of his nature his 89 col 1 13 90 eunomius was the chief representative of the later dialectical arianism and both basil and gregory of nyssa wrote to refute him the particular doctrine that the generation of the son was a creative act of the father’s will had been held by arians from the beginning as well as by eusebius of caesarea they could appeal to the language of earlier fathers including origen who had said de pnncip iv 28 that the son might be called son of the father’s will being the son of his love see athanasius c anan iii 59 ff eunomius distinguished the essence of god from his activity in creation and the time process the latter being identifiable with his will the theory is stated in his apologeticiisy prmted in migne p.g xxx with the works of basil the trinity 167 substance or essence but son of god’s will his intention was to make the will by which the father begot the son an accident in god just as we will something at one time w hich w e did not will before but that is why our own nature must be understood as changeable w hich we cannot possibly beheve of god it is written that there are many thoughts in the heart of a man but the counsel of the lord abideth for ever the whole pur port of which is that we may understand or believe that the counsel of god is unto eternity even as he is eternal and there fore changeless as he is and what is said of thoughts may with equal truth be said of wills there are many wills in the heart of a man but the will of the lord abideth for ever some have sought to avoid speaking of the only begotten word as son of the counsel or will of god by saying that the word is himself the father’s counsel or will g j t it is better in my judgment to call him counsel from counsel or will from will as he is sub stance from substance and wisdom from wisdom in that way we avoid the absurdity already exposed of saying that the son makes the father wise or willing the father being without counsel or will in his own substance we may recall the pene trating answer once given to the heretic who ingeniously enquired whether god begot his son willingly or unwilhngly if one should say unwillingly an impossible affliction would be imposed upon god if wilungly the designed conclusion would at once follow irresistibly that the son is son not of nature but of will to which the wary interlocutor rejoined with another question is god the father god willingly or unwilhngly if the reply were unwillingly again an affliction would be im posed upon god which it were insane to credit if one should say willingly the answer would be that then god is god by will and not by nature the heretic thus had no resource but silence seeing himself caught by his own question in an inescapable dilemma if indeed any person in the trinity is to be termed specially the will of god the name is applicable rather like charity to the holy spirit for charity is strictly a form of willing 39 i believe that my treatment of the holy spirit in this book has given an exposition of holy scripture that may suffice to the believer who knows already that the holy spirit is god prov 19.21 52 the reference may be to athanasius himself who answers arius in this way in the passage referred to above note 90 53 see gregory of nazianzus theological orations iii 6 ed mason l68 augustine later works and is neither of another substance nor lesser than the father and the son of which in earlier books we have demonstrated the truth in accordance with the same scriptures concerning the creature that god has made we have done our best to en courage seekers after a reasoned knowledge to perceive the in visible things of him being understood in the measure possible through the things that are made and especially through the rational or intellectual creature that is made in the image of god in it as in a mirror they may see if they are able and as they are able the trinity of god in our memory understand ing and will let a man have the lively perception of these three existing naturally in his mind by the divine ordering let his memory recall his understanding observe and his love em brace the greatness m that mind whereby even the being that is everlasting and changeless can be remembered viewed and desired and there assuredly he will find an image of the supreme trinity upon the remembering beholding and loving of that supreme trinity that he may recall it contemplate it and delight in it he ought to make all the hfe in him depend but i have also given him such warning as appeared sufficient that this image made by the trinity is altered for the worse by its own fault when therefore he compares it to the divine trinity he must not suppose it like in all respects but rather discern even in its measure of likeness a great unlikeness also 40 xxi of god the father and god the son god the begetter who has in a manner spoken in his own word co eternal with himself all that belongs to his own substance and that same word of his god to whose own substance belongs all in measure neither greater nor less that is in him whose beget ting of the word is no lie but perfect truth these two i have endeavoured to trace so far as possible not as seen face to face but by inference however remote from this likeness in an enigma in the memory and understanding of our human mind to memory we assigned all that we know even though we are not thinking of it and to understanding the impartation of a certain definite form to thought it is by thinking of a truth discovered that we are said especially to understand it and afterwards we leave it once more in the memory but it is in a more recondite depth of our memory that we find such truth when first we think of it and so is begotten that inward word which is of no language as a knowledge from knowledge a vision from vision and an understanding manifest in thought from understanding already present in the memory but hidden yet thought itself the trinity 169 must have some kind of memory of itself else it could not return to things left in the memory when one thought is exchanged for another 41 of the holy spirit i have shown in this enigma of ours no apparent likeness but the will or the love which is will in fuller strength for the will which exists m us by nature acquires vary ing tones in relation to the objects present to it or meeting it by which we are attracted or offended but is it possible to say that our will when rightly directed is ignorant of what to seek or shun if it is not it must contain a knowledge of its own such as cannot be without memory and understanding we could never accept the suggestion that the charity which does no wrong is ignorant of what it does there is both under standing and love in that prime fount of memory wherein we find ready and laid up the truth we can arrive at by the act of thought for both of these we find there present before we thought of them when in the act of thought we discover our own understanding and love of any object there is both memory and love in the understanding which takes form in thought the true word spoken inwardly without any specific language when we say what we know for our thought can only turn its observation upon anything by remembenng and will only be concerned to do so by loving love is that which takes the vision which has its seat in memory and the vision of thought which thence receives form and joins them together as parent and offspring but in the same way unless it possessed the knowledge of purposive seeking which involves memory and understanding it would be ignorant of its own proper object 42 xxii but when these three elements exist in a single person such as a man an objector may make the point that this triad of memory understanding and love belong not to them selves but to me what they do is done for me not for them or rather it is done by me through their means it is i that remem ber by memory understand by understanding love by love when i turn my thought’s eye upon memory and say within myself what i know begetting out of my knowledge a true word both are mine both the knowledge and the word i know and i speak within myself what i know and when in the process of thought i discover in my memory an existing understanding and love for something an understanding and a love which were there already before i thought of them it is my understanding 54 i cor 13.5 see bk x 19 xii 12 lyo augustine later works and 77y love that i find in my memory of which i am the sub ject and not they again when thought performs the act of remembering and by the act of will returns to what it had left in the memory wills to perceive it as understood and to speak it as an inward word the act of remembering is performed with wy memory the act of will with will not its own and when my love remembers and understands what it ought to seek or shun it remembers by memory not its own and understands whatever it loves with understanding by my understanding and not its own in short in all three it is i that remember i that understand i that love and i am neither memory nor under standing nor love but the possessor of them they can be enumerated by the one person who possesses the three of them and is not identical with them but in the uncompounded sim plicity of the supreme being which is god though there is one god there are yet three persons father son and holy spirit 43 xxiii thus there is a difference between the reality of the trinity and its image in another subject the image in virtue of which the mind embracing our three elements is itself called an image just as the word image is applied both to the panel and to the painting on it the panel being named an image because of the picture it supports the absolute trans cendence of the supreme trinity defies comparison a trinity of men cannot be called one man but such is the inseparable unity of the divine trinity that in it both for our naming and in reality there is one god and the trinity is not in one god but is itself one god again the image the man in whom our triad is contained is a single person the trinity is three persons father in relation to son son in relation to father spirit in relation to father and son in our image of the trinity the human memory especially as distinguished from that of beasts by containing ideas not conveyed to it through the bodily senses offers in its own measure a likeness however inadequate of the father the human understanding which receives form therefrom in the effort of thought when the thing known is spoken as an inward word belonging to no language offers in all its disparity a certain hkeness of the son the human love which proceeds from knowledge and is a link between memory and understanding as being common to parent and offspring so that it cannot be identified with either offers in that image a likeness even if an inadequate likeness of the holy spirit but whereas in the image the three do not compose one man but 96 see introduction p 24 the trinity 17i belong to him in the supreme trinity whose image it is the three do not belong to one god but are one god and the persons are not one but three and what is marvellously inex pressible or inexpressibly marvellous though the image of the trinity is one person and the divine trinity itself is three yet the trinity of three persons is more inseparable than the imaged trinity of one for the divine trinity by the nature of its divimty or godhead if the term be preferred is what it is change lessly and always equal to itself at no time was it not or was different at no time will it not be or be different but the three elements contained in the inferior image though not spatially separate not being corporeal yet in this present life are quan titatively variable the fact that material mass is wanting does not prevent us seeing in one man more memory than under standing in another the reverse while in a third these two may be exceeded by love whether they are equal to one another or not thus we may find a superiority of any one severally to the other two of two together to any one severally of any several one to any other of the greater to the less even when they shall be made whole from all infirmity and equal to one another the being that owes its constancy to grace will not attain equality to the being which is essentially changeless there can be no equality between creature and creator and the making whole from all infirmity will itself be a change 44 when the promised vision face to face has come we shall behold the trinity that trinity which is not only incor poreal but perfectly inseparable and truly changeless far more clearly and surely than we now behold its image in ourselves this present vision through a mirror and in an enigma as vouchsafed to us in this life belongs not to any who can per ceive in their own mind all that we have here set out by our analysis but to those who see the mind as an image and so are able to achieve a certain relating of what they see to him whose image it is to reach through their actual vision of the image a presumptive vision of the onginal which cannot yet be seen face to face the apostle does not say we see now a mirror but we see now through a mirror xxiv those who see the mind as it may be seen and in it that trinity of which i have attempted to give a variety of descriptions yet without believing or understanding it to be the image of god they are seeing a mirror but so far from seeing through the mirror him who is now to be seen only in that way they are unaware that the mirror seen is a mirror which is to say an image if they knew 172 augustine later works it they might be conscious of the need to seek and in some measure even now to see through this mirror him whose mir ror it is their hearts being purified by faith unfeigned so that he who is seen now through a mirror may at last be seen face to face but if they despise the faith that purifies hearts no understanding of the most subtle analysis of our mind’s nature can serve but to condemn them on the testimony of their own understanding itself the failure to reach any firm assurance despite all their struggles to understand can be caused only by envelopment in a darkness which is punishment and the burden of a corruptible body which presseth down the soul s such evil can have been incurred only by the guilt of sin and the gravity of the evil should be their warning to follow the lamb that taketh away the sin of the world xxv for men in his keeping whose gifts of intellect are far less than theirs when released from the body at this life’s end are clear of all claim upon them by the powers of malice those powers which the lamb whom they slew without debt of sin vanquished by the right of his blood before overthrowing them by the might of his power 1 free from the power of the devil they have welcome from the holy angels delivered from every evil through the mediator of god and men the man christ jesus for the holy scriptures old and new are at one both those that foretell the christ and those that forth tell him in knowing no other name under heaven whereby men must be saved thus cleansed from every taint of corruption the elect are established in peaceful dwelling places until their bodies be given back to them bodies corruptible no longer for beauty not for burden ing for so the perfect goodness and perfect wisdom of the creator has ordained that the spirit of man in dutiful subjection to god should possess a body blessedly subject to itself and that this blessedness should abide for ever 45 there without any impediment shall we see the truth and enjoy it in perfect clarity and assurance the mind will not pursue a knowledge by reasoning but in contemplation will dis cern why holy spirit is not son though he proceed from the father in that light all such questioning will cease though here its difficulty has been proved so great for me and doubt less for all who read with care and understanding what i have written in my second book i promised to discuss the question in another place but whenever i would have pointed out some 97 i tim i 5 acts 15 9 98 wisdom 9 15 99 john 1.29 1 bk xiii argument 2 i tim 2 5 3 acts 4.12 the trinity 173 likeness to that truth in our creaturely being i found no form of words adequately corresponding to such understanding as i had reached though even in that understanding i am aware of more endeavour than success again when i found in the single person of a man an image of the supreme trinity i sought to make the likeness more easily apprehended in the sphere of things changing and to display it particularly in the ninth book as existing in temporal succession but as we have shown in this fifteenth book our human way of thinking cannot fit the three entities in one person to the three divine persons xxvi moreover in the supreme trinity that is god there is no temporal successiveness whereby the question whether first the son is born of the father and then the holy spirit pro ceeds from both could be answered or even asked holy scrip ture indeed calls him spirit of both it is he of whom the aposde says because ye are sons god hath sent the spirit of his son into your hearts and it is he of whom the son himself says for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father that speaketh in you and there are many other texts of scripture which prove that he who in the trinity has the special title of holy spirit is spirit both of father and of son the son again says of him whom i will send to you from the father and elsewhere whom the father will send in my name that he proceeds from both may be learnt first from the saying of the son that he proceeded from the father and secondly in that after his rising from the dead and appearing to his dis ciples he breathed on them and said receive ye the holy spirit 8 so showing that the spirit proceeds from himsee the spirit is that same virtue which as we read in the gospel went from him and healed them all 46 if one ask why it was that after his resurrection he first gave the holy spirit on earth and afterwards sent him from heaven my answer would be that by this get is shed abroad in our hearts the charity whereby we love god and our neigh bour according to those two commandments on which hang all the law and the prophets to signify this the lord jesus gave the spirit twice once on earth for the love of neighbour and again from heaven for the love of god but if the double gift of the holy spirit should be otherwise explained at least 4 the reference to bk ix seems to be a slip augustine must be thinking ofbk xl c bkx ad jin 5 gal 4 6 6 matt 10 20 7 john 15.26 14 26 8 john 15 26 20 22 9 luke 6.19 rom 5 5 matt 22 37 ff 174 augustine later works we may not doubt that it was the same holy spirit given in the breathing of jesus of whom afterwards he says go baptize all nations in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit it is the same spirit then that was also given from heaven on the day of pentecost ten days after the lord’s ascension into heaven he who gives the holy spirit must assuredly be god nay how great a god must he be who gives god none of his disciples gave the holy spirit they prayed that the spirit should come upon those on whom they laid their hand but they did not themselves give him and the church keeps now the same rule in her officers even simon magus when he offers money to the apostles does not say give me also this power that i may give the holy spirit but that on whomsoever i lay my hands he may receive the holy spirit the words of scripture preceding were not simon seeing that the apostles gave the holy spirit but simon seeing that by the laying on of the apostles hands the holy spirit was given 12 accordingly the lord jesus himself not only gave as god the holy spirit but also received him as man and therefore he is said to be full of grace and full of the holy spirit i3 more expressly is it written of him in the acts of the apostles for god hath anointed him with the holy spirit with no visible oil but with the gift of grace which is signified by the visible unction wherewith the church anoints the baptized doubtless christ’s own anointing with the holy spirit was not at that time when the spirit descended upon him as a dove at his bap tism then it was his body that he deigned to represent his church in which particularly at baptism the holy spirit is re ceived the mystical and invisible anointing of him we must recognize at the moment when the word of god was made flesh that is when human nature with no preceding merits of good works was so linked with god the word in the virgin’s womb as to become one person with him s therefore we confess him born of the holy spirit and the virgin mary it would be incongruous indeed to suppose that he received the holy spirit when he was already thirty years old at which age he was bap tized by john 1 5 he must have come to baptism as altogether without sin so not without the holy spirit if it is written of john his minister and fore runner that he shall be filled with n matt 28 19 12 acts 8 18 f 13 john i 14 luke 4 i acts 10 38 15 cf enchind 36 xi and esp de praed sancly 30 f xv 16 luke 3.21 ff the trinity 175 the holy spirit even from his mother’s womb gince though engendered by the father he yet received the holy spirit when he was formed in the womb how are we to think or believe concermng the man christ the very conception of whose flesh was not fleshly but spiritual when it is written of him that he received from the father the promise of the holy spirit and poured it forth is both natures are displayed the human and the divine he received as man he poured forth as god we can receive indeed the gift according to our capacity but pour it forth upon others we cannot for that we must invoke upon them the god by whom it is performed 47 we cannot then ask whether the holy spirit had already proceeded from the father when the son was begotten or had not yet so proceeded but upon the begetting of the son pro ceeded from both for here nothing takes place in time when we come to deal with the temporal we can suppose will first to proceed from the human mind making a search for what may be called an offspring when it is found with the getting or begetting of this the act of will is completed coming to rest in its object so that the pursuit of the will that sought becomes the love of the will that enjoys and this love now proceeds from both from the begetting mind and the begotten idea as from parent and offspring but it is impossible to look for parallels to this in a region where there are no temporal begin nings that can reach completion in process of time thus given the power to understand the timeless generation of the son from the father one must hkewise understand the timeless proces sion of the holy spirit from both given power to understand in the saying of the son as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself 20 that the father’s gift of hfe is not to a son previously existing without life but that by this timeless generation the life given by the father in his begetting is co eternal with the hfe of the father who gave it one must hkewise understand that as the holy spirit’s procession from the father belongs to the father’s own being so has he given to the son that the same holy spirit should proceed from him in both cases timelessly when it is said that the holy spirit proceeds from the father we under stand that his procession from the son comes hkewise to the son from the father if it is from the father that the son has all that he has it must be from the father that he has the 17 luke 1 15 7 acts 2.33 19 cf bk xiv 8 vi 20 john 5 26 iy6 augustine later works proceeding from him of the holy spirit 21 we must think here of no temporal before or after for here there are no times at all it would be wholly irrational to call the spirit the son of both for while the son receives his being with no temporal origin and no mutability of nature by generation from the father the holy spirit receives his being with no temporal origin and no mutability of nature by procession from both we do not call the holy spirit begotten but neither may we presume to call him unbegotten lest the words suggest either two fathers in the divine trinity or two persons underived the father alone is underived and therefore alone called unbegotten not indeed m scripture but in the common usage of theologians making discourse on such high matter as fitly as they can 22 the son is begotten from the father and the holy spirit proceeds ulti mately from the father and by the father’s gift at no temporal interval from both in common he could be called son of father and of son only if both had begotten him a notion intolerable to all sound feeling thus he is not begotten of both but pro ceeds from the one and the other as the spirit of both 48 xxvii to distinguish generation from procession in the divine trinity co eternal co equal incorporeal beyond all expression changeless and inseparable is indeed most diffi cult for readers who find their thought here at the end of its tether it may suffice for the moment to repeat what we have said in a sermon addressed to our christian congregation and afterwards put in writing i had shown by texts of holy scrip ture that the holy spirit proceeds from both tf then i said the holy spirit proceeds both from the father and from the son why has the son said that he proceedeth from the father 2 3 it can only be after his manner of ascribing that which belongs to himself to him from whom he has his own being for example my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me 24 here the doctrine he says is not his own but the father’s must yet be understood as his doctrine no less must we understand in the text before quoted where he says that the spirit proceedeth from the father not proceedeth not from me that the spirit proceeds also from himself the son is 21 cf above xvii and n 22 in particular the axian theologians profiting from the confusion between the words agennetos unbegotten and agemtos uncreated or eternal had attempted to make unbegottenness the essence of deity itself whence they could argue that he who is begotten is not very god see athana sius de decretis 28 ff 23 john 15 26 24 john 7 16 the trinity 177 god from god and he from whom is derived the godhead of the son is the same from whom is derived the holy spirit’s proceeding from the son so it is from the father that the holy spirit has his procession from the son even as he proceeds from the father and this may enable us to understand so far as understanding is possible for men like us why the holy spirit is not called begotten but is said to proceed for if he also were called son he must be son of both the other persons which would be altogether irrational a son can be son of two only if they be father and mother and between god the father and god the son no relation of the kind is even to be thought of indeed no human son proceeds at one and the same time from father and mother he does not proceed from the mother when he proceeds from father into mother and he does not proceed from the father at the time of his proceeding from the mother into visible existence whereas the holy spirit does not proceed from the father into the son and then from the son to sanctify the creature he proceeds at once from both although his pro ceeding from the son as from the father is the father’s gift to the son we cannot say that while the father is life and the son is life the holy spirit is not life as then the father who has life in himself has given to the son to have life in himself so has he given to the son that life should proceed from him even as it proceeds from himself 25 1 insert this passage from a ser mon into the present book it is addressed of course to the faith ful and not to unbelievers 49 unbelievers indeed may lack the power to contemplate god’s image in them and to see the reality of the three elements in their own mind which are three not as three persons but as all pertaining to the one person of a man then they had best be lieve what the holy books contain concerning the supreme trinity that is god instead of demanding for themselves a per fectly clear and rational account such as weak and sluggish human minds cannot take in by all means once they have an unshakable belief in the truth of holy scripture’s witness let them go on by prayer and enquiry and right living to the pur suit of understanding which means the seeing with the mind so far as seeing is possible of what is firmly held by faith who should forbid them who indeed would not encourage them to do so but if they suppose that the reality must be denied be cause their minds are too blind to perceive it then the blind from birth may with equal right deny the existence of the sun 25 in jo ev xcix 8 f gf above 29 xvu n augustine later works 178 the light shineth in darkness if the darkness comprehend it not fi let those who are darkness first become enlightened by the gift of god into believing and so begin in comparison with the unbelieving world to be light upon that foundation they may be built up to see what they believe and in due course gain the power of sight there are certain matters of belief the sight of which is no longer possible christ can never again be seen upon the cross but without belief in that which once happened and was seen though there can be no expectation of its hap pening or being seen again we can never reach that vision of the christ which shall be without end as for such discernment as is possible for the understanding of the supreme ineffable immaterial and changeless being of god there is no field wherein the human mind can better train its insight under the guidance of the rule of faith than in that possession of human nature which is better than anything in the beasts and better than any other part of the human soul namely the mind itself to it has been granted a certain vision of things invisible it is the authority raised upon the seat of honour in its inner cham ber for whose judgment the bodily senses deliver all their mes sages above it there is none to whose rukng it is subject save god 50 in all this long discourse i dare not claim to have said anything worthy of the unspeakable greatness of the supreme trinity i confess rather that trom myself his knowledge has become wonderful its strength is shown and i cannot attain unto it 27 and thou soul of mine where in all this dost thou find thyself where best thou where standest thou waiting for him who has shown mercy upon all thine iniquities to heal all thy sicknesses 28 doubtless thou seest thyself in that inn whither the samaritan brought him that was found half dead from the many wounds laid on him by the robbers yet thou hast seen many truths not with the eyes that see the hues of bodily things but with those for which the psalmist made his prayer let mine eyes look upon equity 29 thou hast seen many truths indeed and not confused them with that light that enabled thee to see them lift thine eyes to the light itself and fix them upon it if thou canst o then only shalt thou see the difference of the begetting of god’s word from the proces sion of god’s gift wherefore the only begotten son has said that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and is not be 26 john 1 5 27 ps 139 6 28 ps 103 3 29 ps 17.2 30 cf bk viii 3 li the trinity 179 gotten of him so as to be his brother being a certain consub stantial communion between father and son the spirit is called the spirit of both never the son of both but to perceive this plainly and clearly thou art not able to keep thine eye fixed firmly i know thou art not able i speak truth to myself i know what exceeds my power yet the light itself displays to thee those three elements in thyself wherein thou mayest recog nize the image of the supreme trinity whom thou hast not yet the strength to contemplate with unwavering eyes the light itself shows thee that a true word is in thee when it is begotten of thy knowledge that is when we say what we know though it be with no people’s tongue that we utter or think a sound with meaning but our thought receives a form from the object of our knowledge in the view of the thinker arises an image nearly alike to that knowledge which memory contained while the will or love unites the two to one another as parent and off spring that will proceeds from knowledge for no one wills a thing of whose being or nature he is altogether ignorant yet it is not an image of knowledge and thus acre is a suggestion in this mental reality of the difference between begetting and pro ceeding inasmuch as to view in thought is not the same as to pursue or to enjoy with the will so much is to be perceived and discerned by him who is able and thou too hast been able to perceive it although thou couldst not and canst not set forth in adequate expression that truth which through the mists of material similitudes that never cease to invade men’s thinking thou didst hardly see yet the hght which is not thyself shows thee also that the immaterial hkenesses of material things are wholly other than the reality which our understanding contem plates when they are rejected this and the like certainties are manifested by that light to thine inward eye is there any reason why thou canst not behold the hght itself with a gaze un wavering but thine own infirmity and what has made thee infirm but thine own iniquity therefore there is none that can heal all thy sicknesses but he that has mercy upon au thine iniquities so were it better to bring this book at last to an end not with argument but with prayer 51 xxviii o lord our god we believe in thee father son and holy spirit if thou wert not trinity the truth w ould not have

christian morals in the last years of the fourth century the proscription of paganism by the edicts of theo dosius brought into the church large numbers of converts whose christianity can hardly have gone deeper than accept ance of baptism and profession of the name there was enough in the church’s official teaching upon the efficacy of the sacra ments to encourage such nominal christians in the belief that membership of the church was all that was necessary for salva tion the growth and spread of monasticism itself in great part a reaction against the worldhness of churchmen had made familiar the notion of a double standard of morality for those who would be perfect strict compliance with the severest exhorta tions of the gospels for the rest a life of compromise in varying degrees moreover in the western church human nature had for long been painted m darker colours than in the eastern with a greater stress upon the lasting consequences of the fall men had learnt to acknowledge the universahty of sin and the weakness of the human will as facts which compelled rehance upon those means of salvation which the church provided we know nothing for certain about the early life of pelagius but he had certainly been in rome for twenty years perhaps for thirty when the onset of alaric and the goths in 410 drove him with the crowd of refugees first to africa and then to the east he had come to rome likely enough from his native britain as a young man seeking to prepare himself for a civil career but he had soon found his vocation not in the pnest hood nor in the monastery though he was often called a monk but in the exercise of a layman’s mission to the upper the spirit and the letter 183 circles of the more or less christianized roman society of the day he saw himself called to stop the rot to restore the slackened vigour of christian life by recalhng the roman to his ancient ideal of manliness virtus and the chnstian to the inflexible demands of christ we know that the first impression of pela gius which augustine derived from the reading of his book on human nature was that of a man fired with a burning indigna tion against those who instead of laying the blame for their sins upon their human wills put it upon their natural constitution as men and seek to make that nature their excuse i the relipon of pelagius was firmly based upon two axioms that god is just and that man is responsible which means free he thought of the divine justice as the character of a law giver who is also judge who rewards and pumshes men accord ing to their deeds in god’s justice there can be no respect of persons justice forbids the showing favour gratia to one man rather than another a just god can give an unfair start to no one and he can command nothing which any man is unable to perform the existence of a divine command necessarily im plies ability in all to whom it is given to obey it all men can keep the commandments of god if they will but that is to say that nothing counts for god’s judgment of the individual but his own responsible actions god will distribute his rewards and his punishments stricdy according to merit and merit is what each man earns by what he does it is open to all christians without exception to set themselves by a life in accordance with the gospel ideal of poverty chastity and well doing to earn the supreme rewards which only such a hfe can win and if it is open to all it is incumbent upon all a pastoral activity such as that of pelagius inspired by this rigid moralism could no doubt be pursued for a time without compelling attention to its theological implications but it could not long avoid a clash with the sacramental and devotional practice of the church it was too late in the day to open a cam paign against infant baptism and the pelagians did not attempt it but the church knew one and only one baptism tor the re mission of sins the form of the sacrament was the same for infants as for adults if there is no guilt but where there has been responsible action how can the infant need forgiveness and if he needs no forgiveness has christ not died for him again the pelagian homiletic insisted that sinlessness impeccantia was a conch tion achievable by any man in this hfe yet the universahty 1 de natura et gratia i i 184 augustine later works of sin was not only a fact asserted by unequivocal texts of scripture ps 143 2 rom 3 23 i john i 8 it was implied by the petition for forgiveness in the lord’s prayer which every christian however saintly must repeat all his days it was therefore on these two points the significance of in fant baptism and the possibility of avoiding sin that pelagian ism was first challenged pelagius himself seems to have been aware of the danger and anxious to avoid a conflict it was the common christian tradition in east and west alike that adam’s transgression involved the whole human race in a predicament from which salvation is through christ alone but the greek fathers in general thought of this predicament as mortality and they were not exercised by the question of fallen man’s status as a moral agent the effect of the fall upon man’s capacity to do right they followed origen m holding that self determina tion is an essential characteristic of the created spirit fallen man retains that power of deliberate choice without which there can be neither virtue nor vice and this had been maintained in the west both by tertullian as the basis of his doctrine of merit and later by ambrose but tertullian had held the theory known as traducianism according to which every child derives both soul and body from his parents and therefore inherits a nature in which both soul and body suffer from corruption tertullian’s traducianism however regarded the soul itself as material and was therefore unacceptable to later latin fathers in the form he had given it the alternative theory of the soul’s origin was creationism as generally held by the greeks viz that every soul is created at birth by the immediate act of god but this view made it difficult to attach any original defect vitium onginis to the soul and so favoured the tendency which in fact displayed itself in alexandrian theology to find the source of moral evil in the flesh in the third century origen in palestine and cyprian in africa had suggested in similar though vague terms that the baptism of infants implies some kind of defile ment which is inseparable from the process of natural birth here there was serious danger of playing into the hands of manichaeanism a danger which the pelagians were not slow to detect and exploit the matter was bound up with the exegesis of romans 5 the argument of paul in that chapter is best interpreted as teaching not a physical inheritance of sin but a mystical solidarity of mankind in adam analogous to the unity of christians in christ on these lines ambrose bishop of milan the spirit and the letter 185 when pelagius settled in rome taught that we have all sinned in the first man that adam is in each one of us that in adam i fell and in him i have incurred guilt at rome pela gius had written his commentary on the epistles of sl paul in which he takes the language of romans 5 to mean simply that those who sin as adam did die in hke manner i.e that both sin and the spiritual not physical death which is its conse quence come from the following of adam’s example neverthe less he had been careful as augustine noted when the com mentary first came into his hands not to associate himself with the objections which he adduces on rom 5 15 of those who oppose the traducianist doctrine though he added that the same school of thought on the creationist theory will urge that it is unjust that a soul born to day and not derived from the substance massa of adam should bear the ancient sin of another and that reason forbids that god who remits a man’s own sins should impute to him another’s 2 this last observation recalls a well own phrase of cyprian’s who in discussing infant baptism had said that the infant receives re mission not of his own but of another’s sins 2 it was not pelagius himself but his less wary disciple caeles tius whose activities provoked the first official condemnation of pelagian doctrine he had come to africa hke his master as a refugee from rome in 410 and he was summoned before a synod of bishops at carthage at which augustine was not pre sent to condemn a number of propositions attributed to him of which the most important were i that adam’s sin had injured no one but himself 2 that infants come into the world in the same state of innocence as belonged to adam before his fall 3 that even before the coining of christ there had been men whose lives were sinless so that a fortiori under the christian dispensation the avoidance of sin is no impossible ideal of caelestius’s defence we know only that he claimed as he reasonably might that the traducianist theory of the trans mission of sin was not catholic dogma and that he admitted the propriety of infant baptism it is probable that he explained this admission by interpreting the sacrament as one of adoption into christ’s sonship and by making a distinction between eternal life and the kingdom of heaven saying that the unbaptized infant dying without actual sin is not excluded from 2 see the text in souter’s edition of pelagius’s expostuons of ha rteen epistles of sl paul 3 cypnan ep lxiv 5 i86 augustine later works eternal life whereas christian baptism in accordance with john 3 5 is necessary for entry into the kingdom caelestius was condemned and left africa for the east but the dissemination of his ideas had caused so much stir in africa that marcellinus the imperial legate who presided in 41 1 at the great conference with the donatists wrote to consult augustine with whom he was intimate on the questions at issue augustine though at the moment much exercised by the troublesome after math of the conference replied with the first of his anti pelagian works on the deserts and remission of sins the first book deals with the bearing of the church’s baptismal practice on the doctrine of original sin dismisses the attempted dis tinction between eternal life and the kingdom of god and in sists that the text of rom 5 12 can only mean that sin and death pass from adam to his descendants by propagation not by imitation as he in whom all are made alive not only offered himself as a pattern of righteousness to be imitated but also gives to the faithful that altogether hidden grace of his spirit which he pours unseen even into infants so he in whom au die not only is the example imitated by those who voluntarily transgress the commandment of god but also has infected in himself with the hidden corruption of his carnal desire all those who come of his seed this passage makes it clear enough that augustine sees the pauline contrast between adam and christ as one between flesh and spirit in his view the mystery of original sin is bound up with physical heredity while the mystery of grace is purely spiritual though sacramentally conveyed the subject of the second book is the pelagian doctrine of sinlessness augustine begins by admitting that we cannot deny the power of god to bring a man into a state of grace in which he should become altogether free from sin but he thinks that the testimony of scripture and of the confessions of holy men tends to show that no one has in fact reached such a condition he next asks why should this be so if it be pos sible divine grace lending its aid to the human will for men to be without sin the question may be put why then are they not a very simple and true answer would be because they have not the will if i am asked but why have they not we shall need longer to make that plain i may however without pre judice to more careful enquiry say shortly this men will not do 4 see augustine be peccato originally 3 111 iv 5 be pecc mer y i 10 ix the spirit and the letter 187 what is right either because the right is hidden from them or because they find no delight in it for the strength of our will to anything is proportionate to the assurance of our knowledge of its goodness and to the warmth of our dehght in it thus ignor ance and infirmity are failings which hinder the will from being moved to perform a good action or to abstain firom a bad one but that what was hidden may become clear what delighted not may become sweet this belongs to the grace of god which aids the wills of men if they lack that aid the cause lies no less in themselves and not in god whether they be predestined for damnation because of the wickedness of pride or for judgment and instruction against their pride if they be children of mercy this short answer gives us the essence of augus tinianism augustine could not know how much longer he would need to account for men’s unwillingness to do the right but what he has said here not only armounces the theme which he was to develop in the spirit and the letter it lays down the criterion by which he was always to test the claim of pelagians that in their teaching the grace of god was upheld and not denied marcellinus himself was the first to ask for a longer ex planation he thought it paradoxical to concede as augustine did that the achievement of sinlessness was a theoretical possibility and yet to deny not only that it ever has been achieved but that there either has been or ever can be any in stance of a completely sinless human life except in the case of christ himself augustine responded to his request for a solution of this difficulty by writing within the year 412 his treatise on the spirit and the letter which is occupied entirely with an ex position of the doctrine of grace based on an exegesis of paul’s teachmg in the epistle to the romans with the saying of ii cor 3 6 the letter kiueth but the spirit giveth life as text augustine agrees with the comment of pelagius on this text that the opposition of letter and spirit is not that of literal and allegorical or spiritual interpretation of scrip ture but whereas pelagius on rom 3 28 had taken the works of the law apart from which a man is justified by faith to mean the external ceremonies of circumcision sab bath etc augustine shows convincingly that the whole argu ment of the epistle is concerned with the law as a system of ethical precepts which can do nothing but convince of sin and with grace as the divinely given power to fulfil these same de pecc mer ii a6 xvii l88 augustine later works precepts what is enjoined under the law of works is granted under the law of faith 22 the divine assistance for the working of righteousness consists not in god’s gift of the law full as it is of good and holy commands but in that our will itself without which we cannot do the good is aided and up lifted by the imparting of the spirit of grace 20 grasp this clear difference between the old covenant and the new that there the law is written upon tables here upon hearts so that the fear imposed by the first from without becomes the de light inspired by the second from within and he whom the letter that killeth there made a transgressor is here made a lover by the spirit that giveth life then you can no longer say that god assists us in the working of righteousness and works in us both to will and to do according to his good pleasure inas much as he makes us hear with the outward sense the command ments of righteousness no it is because he gives increase within us by the shedding abroad of charity in our hearts through the holy spirit which is given us 42 in all the long series of augustine’s anti pelagian writings there is none that can compare with the spirit and the letter for calm and confident grasp of christian principles here augus tine is not debating there is none of the wearisome eristic of the later treatises he is going straight to the fountainhead of all christian faith in the grace of god and triumphantly vindicat ing that faith with an understanding of paul more profound than any shown by earlier interpreters augustine’s exegesis is often mistaken in detail and we know now that the pauline justification is not the equivalent as he thought it was of being made righteous it remains true to day that if we would penetrate beneath the surface of language and logical form to the vital springs of paul’s religion we shall hardly find a better guide than this httle book for our understanding of augustine himself however a special interest attaches to the latter part of the work in which having completed his exposition of paul he turns to examine two objections to the doctrine of grace which has been set forth i if grace alone enables men to fulfil the law what is to be said of good works outside the gospel and the church paul speaks in rom 2 14 of gentiles which have not the law doing by nature the things contained in the law now augus tine cannot surrender his conviction that saving grace is the grace of our lord jesus christ he begins by suggesting that paul is here referring to gentile christians but he is not qmte the spirit and the letter 189 happy about this clearly mistaken interpretation and expects it to be disputed there is he says a possible alternative the image of god belongs to the created nature of humanity and it is ineffaceable however obscured by sin its survival may en able even the heathen to recognize and at least in part to per form the commandments of god for what is written upon the heart in the new covenant is still the same law which was not altogether effaced by growing old but he will not admit that such natural righteousness can be inspired by the true love of god which is the gift of grace it cannot bring the salva tion which is through grace alone it can only avail as no doubt it will in god’s justice avail for mitigation of punishment augustine could have reached no other conclusion without allowing the truth of one of the propositions charged against gaelestius viz that the law admits to the kingdom of heaven as well as the gospel with the general tradition of the church he believed that the saints of the old testament were not excluded from salvation but this could only be because in the light of prophecy they had believed in the christ who was to come 2 the second objection is one which is both more funda mental in itself and more important for the controversy does not the operation of grace so conceived violate human free dom augustine’s answer is confused by his carelessness in the use of terms he starts from the expression liberum arbitrium usually translated free will but more properly free choice or free decision and he maintains that it is something which has to be conferred by grace in the order or process of salvation faith comes first then grace which heals the sick soul then the liberum arbitrium which the healing makes possible and then the love of righteousness which fulfils the law here liberum arbitrium is said not to exist before the work of grace it is the christian freedom which augustine generally calls hberty but he proceeds to ask in what sense the faith with which the whole series begins can be said to be in our power and he answers that the faith in god which is belief in his promises must like all belief be a voluntary act and therefore is in our power be cause we perform it if we will then arises the question whence comes the will to believe from god’s gift or from the liberum arbitrium which is implanted in us by nature and now this liberum arbitrium is described as a neutral power conferred upon the rational soul in the way of nature by god’s creative act and therefore itself as pelagius also insisted the igo augustine later works gift of god god will judge men according to their use of this gift but the good use of liberum arbitrium which shows itself in the will to believe depends upon god’s calling in the form of those presentations or suasions which come to us by his providence in our day to day experience sixteen years earlier in his answer to the questions of simpliaanus written before he knew anything of pelagius he had developed this idea of the calling of god we are enjoined to believe in order that we may receive the gift of the holy spirit and the power to do good works through love but who can believe unless he be touched by some kind of calling some testifying of the truth who has it in his own power to bring it about that his mind receive such impressions as may move his will to faith 7 in the spirit and the letter the consent to this calling is said to belong to our own will but only as the act of acceptance the crucial text what hast thou which thou hast not received is still upheld and god is said to work in us the will to believe the later history of the pelagian controversy does not con cern us here but it is worth while to examine the attempts of pelagius during the years that passed between 412 and his final condemnation m 418 to defend himself against the charge of making the grace of god of none effect in 415 his treatise on came into augustine’s hands and augustine quotes freely from it in his book on nature and grace written in that year pelagius had begun by arguing for the possibility of being without sin which as we have seen augustine was prepared to allow pelagius went on to deny that sin could weaken or alter nature and to assert that sin cannot be a personal action unless it is voluntary which implies that it is avoidable i shall be told he said that many are disturbed at my appearing to maintain a man’s ability to be without sin as though it did not come through the grace of god and he exclaims indignantly that he has insisted upon the derivation of this very ability from god as the author of nature that we are able not to sin is not he says a matter of will or choice arbitrium at all it is a natural necessity we cannot be without the ability to avoid sin that is how god has made us in this same year 415 pelagius had been acquitted of heresy by a synod of palestinian bishops confronted with statements of caelestius to the effect that the grace and help of god is not given for particular actions but consists in the power of free choice or in law and teaching and that god’s grace is given 7 de div qiiaest ad simpl i 21 de nau et grat 52 ff the spirit and the letter i9i according to our deserts since if he gave it to sinners he must appear to be unjust pelagius had answered have never held such views and i anathematize anyone who may hold them whether this disclaimer was entirely sincere it is diffi cult to say but in the long profession of orthodoxy which he submitted to the pope in 417 there were only a dozen words on the question of grace vlule confessing the reality of free choice we maintain that we always have need of the help of god 10 what he meant by the help of god he had made clear enough in the work on freedom of choice composed after his acquittal by the palestinian synod from which we have extracts in augustine’s treatise on the grace of chrut written in 418 after the final condemnation of the heresy pelagius had analysed moral activity into i ability 2 will and 3 performance ascribing the first to god’s gift and the two latter to our selves it is god he wrote who has given us the ability to will and to work and by the help of his grace continually assists this ability itself and such assistance is given through doctrine and revelation whereby god opens the eyes of the heart shows what is to come uncovers the wiles of the devil and illuminates us with the gift of heavenly grace god works in us to will by the promise of reward by the revelation of wis dom and by all manner of good counsel that we are able to do what is good comes of him who gave us this ability that we do good belongs to ourselves it is ghnst who absolves be hevers from all their sins through baptism and then encourages them to perfect holiness by the imitation of himself and over comes the force of evil habit by his example of au virtues the divine aid thus recognized by pelagius appears to coincide closely enough with those presentations or suasions experienced by the individual in the course of his hfe in which augustine saw the calling of god and which he commonly describes as the divine preparation of the will if augustine had maintained consistently and unambiguously that the will’s consent to this calling must be a genuinely free act of personal decision the cleavage between him and pelagius would have been less complete indeed his position would have superficially resembled what was later known as semi pelagianism the doctrine that men have power to make the initial act of faith 9 de gest pelag 30 xiv 10 the libellus fidei is given in the appendix to tom x of augustme’s works in the benedictine edition u de grot ckristi 7 8 ii 26 43 102 augustine later works of themselves he was aware that he himself had begun by holding a similar doctrine and he dated his realization that faith is wholly the gift of god from that closer study of the epistle to the romans to which he had been drawn at the beginning of his episcopate yet in the spirit and the letter as we have seen he was still able to say that the consent of the will to the calling of god is our own and he finds no occasion to correct this statement in the retractations in which the change in his views is frankly admitted but in the work on grace and free choice written in 426 just before the retractations were finished he had declared roundly that god brings about our willing without us he seems never to have perceived that faith is the will’s consent or response to the calling of god and that this consent is not always once for all but may need continually to be renewed the effect of the pelagian controversy was to sharpen the dilemma either god’s work or ours that the dilemma is false augustine himself was able even in his old age to recognize on occasion in his earliest attempt to deal with problems arising from the epistle to the romans he had writ ten that we believe is our own act that we work what is good belongs to him who gives the holy spirit to them that believe he comments in the retractations 1 23 i should not have said that if i had known then that faith itself is found among the gifts of god which are given in the same spirit both therefore faith and works are ours through the choice arbitnum of our will and yet both are given through the spirit of faith and charity that was to fall back upon the true para dox of grace as paul expressed it crucified with christ i live yet not i but christ liveth in me he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit there lies the ultimate difference between pelagian and augustinian religion the theology of pelagius was the theology of deism his ethics were the ethics of natuialism there was no room in his version of christianity for christ in you the hope of glory nor for the real indwelling of the holy spirit in the believer augustine saw that in such a version the gospel has disappeared and we owe it to him that the church has not parted company with paul 12 joe grat et lib arb 33 xvii the spirit and the letter argument the possibiuty of moral perfection for a man in this life may reasonably be allowed even if christ be the only instance of it for god could do many thmgs which he does not do and human righteousness is itself a divine work 1 3 what we cannot admit is that the human wiu is sufficient of itself to reach or even to move towards such perfection for that it must be divinely aided and that not merely by its creation with freedom to choose and by instruction in the moral ideal 4 a man must also receive the holy spint’s gift of that delight in righteousness which is the love of god 5 instruction in the law of god is by itself the letter that killeth ii cor 3 6 the meaning of the letter in this text is not to be limited to scripture as understood literally as against its allegorical interpretation the letter may also stand for the moral precepts of the law which must necessarily be taken literally and so the spint that giveth life may mean not spiritual or allegorical interpretation of scripture but the spirit’s gift of the desire for what is good 6 7 this can be shown by a study of paul’s argument in rom chs 5 7 his subject is the contrast of law and grace 8 1 1 the grace which he knew from his own experience 12 he meets the jew’s boast in the possession of the law by showing that the law avahs nothing if it be not kept the law brings only the knowledge of sin 13 14 and the righteousness which keeps the law is not product of men’s will but is the righteousness of god i.e the righteousness which god im parts to men upon faith in christ 15 16 glorying i.e the conceit of righteousness is cut out by the law of faith 193 194 augustine later works the thankful acknowledgment of the righteousness of god i 18 5 which paul has proclaimed at the beginning of the epistle showing that if glory be not given to god only the natural knowledge of god as creator cannot save men from the cor ruption of sin 19 20 paul does not mean that the law of works belongs to judaism and the law of faith to christian ity for the moral law thou shalt not covet is equally valid for both 21 the difference between the two is that what is enjoined with threatenings under the law of works is granted to belief under the law of faith 22 that the letter that killeth is in fact the moral law sum marized in the decalogue is as plain from the whole context of ii cor ch 3 23 24 as from the argument of rom ch 7 25 26 the passage of ii cor suggests a contrast be tween sinai and pentecost the finger of god which wrote the law on tables of stone and the finger of god as the holy spirit writing upon the heart 27 28 the one working through fear the other through love 29 the one a letter which is external the other an inward presence 30 31 in this same passage paul refers to the new covenant spoken of in jeremiah 31 32 33 the new differs from the old not by substituting a new law but by giving the power to fulfil the law 34 the new covenant heals the sickness of the old man 35 again the promises attached to the old covenant were earthly material benefits 36 the promise of the new covenant is a spiritual good the life which is the knowledge of god 37 39 the promise is given to the true israel after the spirit that is to god’s elect 40 to whom he grants the vision of himself 41 42 to the doctrine of grace so stated it may be objected i that paul himself speaks of gentiles who do by nature the things contained in the law rom 2 14 but this cannot con tradict his teaching that all true righteousness is of grace 43 either a these gentiles are christian believers 44 45 the law being written on their hearts as heirs of the new covenant 46 and the nature by which they fulfil the law being the image of god restored by grace 47 or 4 they are heathen in whom some trace of the divine image re mains as strangers from the grace of christ their good works cannot bring them salvation though they may receive a lighter punishment 48 49 on either interpretation it remains true that no man can claim credit for his own fulfilment of the law 50 a man must be justified before he can do the the spirit and the letter i95 works of which it is written that if a man do he shall live in them 51 ii that the doctrine would deprive man of the freedom to choose we may reply that this freedom is established by the grace which heals the soul 52 but since the gift of grace only follows upon faith we have to ask whether faith itself is in our own power power may be defined as will plus capacity to act 53 the act of belief involves the consent of the will no one believes unwillingly nor is it true that all willing is of god since in any case the evil will is not 54 the belief in god which is faith is in our power because it is a willing act 55 but it must be the belief of sons not slaves of love not fear and love is always the gift of the spirit 56 whence then comes the will to believe from nature or from god’s gift in either case we ask why is it not universal 57 natural gift of freedom to choose is morally neutral and that whether we use it rightly or wrongly the will of god is undefeated for god renders to au according to their works 58 59 but the will to beheve is not only a function of the natural freedom of choice it depends on the presentations which come to us in experience whether objec tively or subjectively caused and of these god is the author our own consent to his calling is necessary but this consent is itself an act of acceptance by which we receive god’s gift 60 summary and conclusion 61 66 perfect righteousness in this hfe is not an impossibility if we allow as we must that our righteousness is a work of god for it presumes no more than the perfect knowledge of what is right and an insuperable delight in it normally both our knowledge of god’s will and our love of him are in this life imperfect the present life may indeed show a lesser righteousness in which there is no sin in the sense of consent to evil desire but even so we must still pray forgive us our trespasses god could re move from a man au need for such a prayer but as far as we know he does not the text i i my beloved son marceuinus i sent to you not long ago two essays in the first of which i discussed the practice of iifiant baptism and in the second the idea of moral perfection as an end never reached or likely to be reached by any man in this life save only by the one mediator igs augustine later works who endured the trials of humanity in the likeness of sinful flesh remaining altogether without sin and now you tell me that you are struck by my speaking in the second of these essays of the possibility of a man’s being without sin if god’s help be given and his own will not lacking and yet asserting that there neither has been nor will be any man except him alone in whom all shall be made alive to reach such perfection while he lives on earth you think it a paradox to claim as possible a thing of which no instance can be given yet i suppose you would not doubt that there has been no case of a camel’s passing through the eye of a needle though christ said that even this is possible for god scripture tells you that twelve thousand legions of angels could have fought to save christ from his pas sion yet it did not happen 3 scnpture tells you that the nations could have been cut off all at once from the land given to the children of israel yet god willed that it should only be by little and little we can think of any number of other things which we admit might have happened or may happen though we can allege no instance of their occurrence we should not then deny the possibility of a man’s being without sin simply because there is no man save him who is not only man but very god in whom we can show this perfection actually achieved 2 ii you may object that the cases i have mentioned of things possible yet not actual are works of god whereas the avoidance of sin belongs to man’s own working man can do no better work than that which results in a righteousness full per fect and complete in every part and you think it not creible if such a work can be achieved by man that there neither has been nor is nor will be anyone m this life who has achieved it but you should consider that though this pursuit is indeed man’s business it too is a divine gift and so you should not doubt it to be a divine work for it is god says the apostle who worketh in you both to will and to do according to his good will 3 3 accordingly we need not be disturbed by those who maintain that any man lives or has lived in this world entirely without sin we must press them to establish their assertion if they can there are texts of scripture which seem to me to lay it down that no man in this life free though he be to choose is ever found without sin for example enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justi fied if anyone can show that this and the like texts do not 1 i cor 15 22 2 matt 19 24 26 3 matt 26.53 4 judg 2 20 ff 3 phil 2 13 ps 143 2 the spirit and the letter i97 mean what they appear to say and can prove that there has been a man or men whose life has been sinless only a very grudging critic would refuse to accept his demonstration i wiu not say without opposition but rather wddi enthusiasm on the other hand supposing as i incline to think that no one is or was or will be so perfect in purity it would not so far as i can judge be an error either serious or mischievous to maintain the contrary the mistake being naturally caused by a generous disposition provided that the holder of such an opinion do not hold himself to be an example of perfection unless his conscience has really and clearly declared it to him 4 but there is an opinion that calls for sharp and vehement resistance i mean the belief that the power of the human will can of itself without the help of god either achieve perfect righteousness or advance steadily towards it when we press upon those who so think the presumption of supposing this to happen without divine aid they check themselves from venturing a statement which they see would be irrehgious and intolerable but they say that the reason why it does not happen without divine aid is that god has both created man in possession of a win that chooses freely and teaches him by the t of his com mandments the right way of life so that god’s help consists m the removal by instruction of man’s ignorance so that he can know what is to be avoided in his actions and what is to be sought and thus by means of the power of free choice belong mg to him by nature he may enter upon the road pointed out to him and by a life of self control justice and piety may merit attainment to the life which is both blessed and eternal 5 hi our own assertion on the contrary is this that the human will is divinely assisted to do the right in such manner that besides man’s creation with the endowment of freedom to choose and besides the teaching by which he is instructed how he ought to live he receives ae holy spirit whereby there arises m his soul the delight in and the love of god the supreme and changeless good this gift is his here and now while he wallcs by faith not yet by sight that having this as earnest of god’s free bounty he may be fired in heart to cleave to his creator kindled m mind to come within the shining of the true light and thus receive from the source of his being the only real well being free choice alone if the way of truth is hidden avails for nothing but sin and w hen the right action and the true aim has begun to appear clearly there is stiu no doing no devotion no go life unless it be also delighted in and loved igs augustine later works and that it may be loved the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts not by the free choice whose spring is in ourselves but through the holy spirit which is given us 6 iv the truth is that the teaching which gives us the commandment of self control and uprightness of life remains without the presence of the life givmg spirit a letter that killeth that text the letter killeth but the spirit giveth hfe 8 naturally taken to mean that we are not to understand the figurative sayings of scripture in their literal sense which may be irrational but to look for their deeper significance and find nourishment for the inward man in a spiritual understanding of them inasmuch as to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace there is much for ex ample in the song of songs which if carnally understood must encourage the passion of lustful desire and not the fruit of en lightened charity but this is not the only meaning of the apostle’s saying the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life there is also and perhaps more important the sense which he clearly indicates elsewhere in the words i was unaware of concupiscence did not the law say thou shalt not covet and a little further on sin taking occasion by the command ment deceived me and through it slew me ii there is the letter killing the words thou shalt not covet are no figurative saying not to be understood literally they are a most plain and wholesome command the fulfiuer of which will be altogether without sin the apostle has purposely chosen a general all embracing precept to convey the voice of the law forbidding all sin for there is no sin whose commission does not begin with coveting accordingly the law which gives this command is good and praiseworthy but where the holy spirit’s aid is not given leading us to covet good 2 instead of evil that is shedding charity abroad in our hearts there assuredly this law good though it be increases by its pro hibition the evil desire a continuing flow of water in the same 7 rom 5.5 this text to which augustine is continually returning re mained for him the most conclusive scriptural refutation of pelagianism it must be noted that he always takes it to refer not to god’s love for us but to our love for god cf 56 ad jin but since for him love m us is the product of god’s love for us he is not really misusing the text 8 ii cor 3.6 9 this was the sense in which augustine had heard the text employed by ambrose at milan before his conversion cf conf vi 4 10 rom 8 6 u rom 7 7 ii 12 here augustme uses the phrase concupiscentia bona as cantos the spirit and the letter i99 direction gains in impetus vhen an obstacle is interposed and after overcoming its resistance breaks forth with added volume in a more headlong current the coveted object grows somehow more attractive through being forbidden that is how sin deceives through the commandment and through it kills provoking the transgression which does not exist where there is no law 7 v it will be well to consider and as god shall help us expound this whole passage of paul’s epistle i wish to show if i can that the apostle’s words the letter kiueth but the spirit giveth hfe do not refer primarily to figurative modes of speech though that sense may also fit them but rather to the law’s express forbidding of what is evil that being demon strated it will be the more evident that the good life is a divine gift not only because god has given man the power of free choice without which moral life were impossible not only be cause he has given the commandment to teach us how to live but because through the holy spirit he sheds abroad charity in the hearts of those whom he foreknew that he might pre destinate predestinated that he might call called that he might justify and justified that he might glorify if i can make this clear i think you will see that the proposed objection falls to the ground i mean the argument that nothing is to be called possible in the absence of an instance but works of god hke my case of the camel’s passing through the needle’s eye and all else that with us is impossible but not with god and that human righteousness cannot be included in this class as belonging not to god’s work but man’s so that there can be no reason for dis believing in any example of its perfection if that perfection is possible in this hfe this argument i say must clearly fall to the ground once we are assured that human righteousness itself though not arising independently of man’s will is yet to be ascribed to the operation of god we cannot deny the possi bihty of its perfection in this life just because all things are possible for god both what he does by his own will alone and what he has ordained to be accomplished by himself with the co operation of the wills of his creatures anything m either kind that he does not do will be without example in fact but will have the reason of its possibility in god’s power and the reason of its non occurrence in god’s wisdom such reason may be hidden from a man but he must not forget his humanity and attribute unwisdom to god because the wisdom of god exceeds his grasp 13 rom 4 15 14 rom 8 29 f 200 augustine later works 8 now consider the apostle’s exposition in his epistle to the romans in which he gives sufficient proof that his words to the corinthians the letter kiueth but the spirit giveth hfe are to be understood as we have said in that the letter of the law admonishing us to avoid sin kills if the life giving spirit be not present for the law makes sin to be known rather than shunned and inasmuch as transgression of law is added to the evil of coveting to be increased rather than diminished 9 vi the apostle’s aim is to commend the grace which came through jesus christ to all peoples lest the jews exalt themselves above the rest on account of their possession of the law he says 15 that through one man sin and death entered into the human race and through one man righteousness and eternal life by the one pointing obviously to adam and by the other to christ and he proceeds the law entered in that the offence might abound but where the offence abounded grace did much more abound that as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord next he puts to himself the question what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid he has seen that perverse readers might put a perverse interpretation on what he has just said the law entered in that the offence might abound but where the offence abounded grace did much more abound he might be taken to assert that because of the abounding of grace sin was profitable he rejects this with his god forbid and adds how shall we that are dead to sin live therein that is to say since grace has effected for us our death to sin to live therein would be nothing but ingratitude to grace to praise the benefits of medicine does not imply a profit in the diseases and wounds which medicine heals the higher our praise of medicine the stronger is our censure and abhorrence of the hurts and diseases from which the admired art relieves us so the praise and preaching of grace is the censure and condemna tion of offences man needed to be shown the foulness of his malady against his wickedness not even a holy and good commandment 5 could avail by it the wickedness was rather increased than diminished for the law entered in that the offence might abound so that thus convicted and confounded he might see his need for god not only as teacher but as helper to direct his ways lest any iniquity have dominion over him that he should flee to the help of mercy for his healing and so 15 cf rom 5 12 6 ii 15 rom 7 12 i 7 ps 119 133 201 the spirit and the letter where the offence abounded grace should yet more abound not by the desert of the sinner but through the aid of the succouren 10 to this same healing medicine mystically shown forth in christ’s passion and resurrection the aposde points in his next words know ye not that so many of us as were baptized in christ jesus were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ rose from the dead through the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted to gether in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the like ness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man has been crucified with him that the body of sin may be brought to nought that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is justified from sin now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall live together with him knowing that christ rising from the dead dieth no more and death shall have no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once for all but in that he liveth he hveth unto god so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead imto sin but living unto god in christ jesus it is plain enough that by the mystery of the lord’s death and resurrection is signified the setting of our old life and the rising of the new there is shown forth the destruction of sin and the renewal of righteousness surely so great a benefit can come to man not by the letter of the law but only by faith in jesus christ ii vii this holy consideration preserves the sons of men who hope in the protection of god’s wings that they may be satisfied with the fatness of his house and drink of the river of his pleasures for with him is the fountain of life and in his light we shall see light he extends his mercy unto them that know him and his righteousness unto them that are of an up right heart he extends his mercy not because they know him but in order that they may know him he extends his righteousness whereby he justifies the ungodly not because they are upright in heart but that they may become upright in heart this consideration does not lead astray into pride the fault that arises from trust in self and making the self the spring of its own life to go that way is to draw back from the fountain of life whose draught alone gives the righteousness which is good hfe and from that changeless hght by whose participation the reasonable soul is as it were set burning so as to be itself a light made and created so was john a burning and a shining 18 ps 36.711 202 augustine later works light yet one that knew whence came his shining of his fullness says the gospel we have received of the fullness that is of him in comparison with whom john was no light for that was the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into this world accordingly in the psalm from which we have quoted the words extend thy mercy to them that know thee and thy righteousness unto them that are of upright heart it continues let not the foot of pride come upon me and let not the hands of sinners disturb me there are they fallen all that work wickedness they are cast out and were not able to stand by the ungodliness which makes a man ascribe to himself what belongs to god he is driven into his own darkness the works of iniquity those works assuredly he does himself and for their accomplishment he is sufficient to himself but the works of righteousness he cannot do except as he receives of that fountain and that light where there is life in need of noth ing where there is no change nor shadow of alteration 21 12 paul the apostle who chose to be called paul as i think instead of his former name of saul simply to indicate his little ness as the least of the apostles contends with such vigour and zeal on behalf of this grace of god against the proud and arrogant presumei s upon their own works just because the manifestation of grace had been in himself more especially plain and notable his own work m vehement persecution of the church of god had earned for him condign penalty but in stead of condemnation he received mercy instead of punish ment he met with grace rightly then is he loud and eager above all in the defence of grace he cares nothing for the mahce of men without understanding in this profound and inscrutable matter who twisted his wholesome sayings into a perverted sense unhesitatingly he preaches the gift of god by which alone salvation comes to the sons of promise the sons of divine goodness the sons of grace and mercy the sons of the new testament his greeting is always in these terms grace to you and peace from god the father and the lord jesus christ 22 and in his letter to the romans this very matter is almost his sole concern waging his fight with such manifold argument as to weary the reader’s endeavour to follow yet such weariness is profitable and wholesome training rather than enfeebling the physique of the inward man 13 viii from this argument come the words which i 19 john 5 35 20 john i 16 9 21 james i 17 22 e g i cor 1.3 the spirit and the letter 20 have already quoted and also the passage in which he convicts the jew saying that he is named jew and yet by no means car ries out what he professes if thou art called a jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast m god and knowest his will and approvest distinctions being instructed out of the law if thou art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of them which are in darkness an instructor of the foolish a teacher of babes having the form of knowledge and truth in the law thou therefore which teachest another teachest thou not thyself thou that preachest against stealing dost thou steal thou that speakest against adultery dost thou commit adultery thou that abhorrest idols dost thou do sacrilege thou that makest thy boast in the law through breaking the law dis honourest thou god for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles through you as it is written circumcision indeed profiteth if thou keep the law but if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision therefore if the uncircumcised keep the righteous acts of the law shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision and shall not un circumcision which is by nature if it fulfil the law judge thee who by the letter and circumcision art a breaker of the law for he is not a jew which is one in appearance neither is that circumcision which is apparent in the flesh but he is a jew which is a jew in the unseen and by circumcision of the heart in the spirit not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of god 23 here is shown the meaning of the words thou makest thy boast in god if one that was a jew indeed should make his boast in god in the manner called for by grace which is given not according to the merits of works but freely his praise would be of god and not of men but they made their l3oast in god as though they alone had deserved to receive his law according to that verse of the psalm he hath not so done unto any nation and hath not shown forth his judgments unto them 24 yet this law of god they supposed themselves to fulfil by their own righteousness though they were rather its trans gressors and so its working for them was wrath as sin multi plied committed by those who knew it for sin even those who did as the law commanded without the help of the spirit of grace did it through fear of punishment and not from love of righteousness thus in god’s sight there was not in their will that obedience which to the sight of men appeared in their work they were the rather held guilty for that which god knew they 23 rom 2 17 ff 24 ps 147 20 augustine later works 204 would have chosen to commit if it could have been without penalty by circumcision of the heart paul means a will pure of all unlawful coveting and this comes not of the teaching and threatening of the letter but of the helping and healing of the spirit therefore is the praise of such not of men but of god who by this grace supplies that to which praise is due god of whom the psalm says in the lord shall my soul be praised 25 and to whom it says with thee is my praise 2 this is not the mind of those who will have praise rendered to god because they are men but to themselves because they are righteous 27 14 what is their answer we do give praise they say to god as author of our justification inasmuch as he gave the law by the study of which we know how we ought to live they are deaf to the scripture because from the law shall no flesh be justified before god 28 it may be so before men but not before him who sees into the very heart and inward will and there perceives even though the fearer of the law act otherwise how he would act if he were given licence we cannot suppose that the aposde means here by the law by which no man is justified the law of ancient rites in which many commandments were figuratively conveyed as in that of circumcision itself to be received by infants upon the eighth day for he goes on im mediately to define that law of which he was speaking in the words for through the law is the knowledge of sin it is then the same law of which he says later i have not known sin but through the law for i was unaware of concupiscence did not the law say thou shalt not covet 29 in other words through the law is the knowledge of sin 15 ix here perhaps it will be rejoined by that human presumption which is ignorant of god’s righteousness and eager to establish its own 3 o that the apostle had good cause to say from the law shall no man be justified since the law does but point out what is to be done or not done in order that the will may carry out its promptings and so man be justified not by the law’s command but by his own free choice nay but o man consider what follows but now without law the right eousness of god hath been manifested witnessed to by law and prophets 31 can even the deaf fail to hear the righteousness 25 ps 34.2 26 ps 22 25 27 the general argument for grace against pelagianism righteoxisness is a greater gift than existence 28 rom 3 20 29 rom 7 7 30 rom 10.3 31 rom 3 21 the spirit and the letter 205 of god hath been manifested this is that righteousness of which they are ignorant who would establish their own and will not be subject to that other the righteousness of god not the righteousness of man or the righteousness of our own will the righteousness of god not that by which god is righteous but that wherewith he clothes man when he justifies the ungodly to this law and prophets bear witness the law inasmuch as by its commands and its threatenings and its justifying of no man it gives ample token that man is justified by the gift of god through the help of the spirit and the prophets because christ’s coming has fulfilled that which they foretold for how does the apostle continue the righteous ness of god through the faith of jesus christ that is the faith whereby we believe in christ the faith of christ here meant is not that by which christ believes any more than the right eousness of god is that by which god is righteous both are our own called of god and of christ because bestowed upon us by his bounty thus the righteousness of god without law is yet manifested not without the law otherwise it could not have been witnessed to through the law it is indeed a right eousness of god without law because god confers it upon the believer through the spirit of grace without the help of the law the law that is contributes nothing to god’s saving act through it he does but show man his weakness that by faith he may take refuge in the divine mercy and be healed it is said of god’s wisdom that she beareth law and mercy on her tongue 2 law by which the proud are held guilty mercy by which the humble are justified accordingly there is a right eousness of god through the faith of jesus christ unto all that believe for there is no difference all have sinned and are in want of the glory of god not of their own glory for what have they which they have not received and if they have re ceived why do they glory as though they had not received 3 they are in want of the glory of god and observe the conclu sion are justified freely by his grace justified then not by the law not by their own will but freely by his grace not that the justification is without our will but the weakness of our will is discovered by the law so that grace may restore the will and the restored will may fulfil the law established neither under the law nor in need of law i6 x the law is not made for the righteous man yet it is good if a man use it lawfully 4 in putting together these 32 prov 3 16 lxx 33 i cor 4 7 34 i tim 1 8 f 206 augustine later works two seemingly conflicting statements the apostle prompts his reader to the asking and answering of a question in what sense can it be said that the law is good if a man use it lawfully if the following words are true knowing this that the law is not made for the righteous for who but the righteous uses the law lawfully yet it is not made for him but for the unright eous the answer is that the unrighteous in order that he may be justified that is made righteous must use lawfully the law as the tutor conducting him to grace through which alone he can fulfil the law’s commands through grace he is justified freely that is by no preceding merits of his own works otherwise grace is no more grace 3 for it is given not because we have done good works but in order that we may have power to do them not because we have fulfilled the law but in order that we may be able to fulfil it for of him who said i came not to destroy the law but to fulfil it is writ ten we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten from the father full of grace and truth that is the glory of which it is said that all have sinned and are in want of the glory of god and that is the grace of which paul speaks in the same breath being justified freely by his grace the un righteous man then uses the law lawfully in order that he may be made righteous when he has been made righteous he is to use it no longer even as the use of a vehicle ceases at the journey’s end or in the apostle’s own simile already men tioned the use of a tutor when instruction is completed if the law is necessary for the righteous also not to bring him while as yet unrighteous to the grace which justifies but to be used lawfully by him after his becoming righteous it is hard to see how the law is not made for the righteous man we may per haps answer indeed we may surely answer that there is a lavdtul use of the law by him who is already righteous which consists in his putting the fear of it upon the unrighteous so when they too have found the plague of inveterate covetousness worsened by the stimulus of prohibition and the multiplying of transgression they may take refuge by faith with the grace that justifies and escape the punishment threatened by the letter through being brought by the spirit’s gift to delight in the sweetness of righteousness in this way there will be no con trariety nor conflict between the tw o positions that the right eous also may use lawfully the good law and yet the law be 35 gal 3 24 36 rom ii 6 37 matt 5 17 38 john i 14 the spirit and the letter 2o7 not made for the righteous for he is justified not by it but by the law of faith through which he has believed that his own infirmity could in no way be enabled to fulfil the commands of the law of works save by the succour of divine grace 17 where then asks the apostle accordingly is thy glorying it is cut out by what law the law of works nay but by the law of faith 3 here the glorying may be that commendable glorying in the lord cut out not in the sense of being banished but in that of being made to stand forth in rehef in this sense we sometimes call a worker in silver a cutter out and the same use is found in the psalm text that they who are approved by silver may be cut out which means that they who are approved by the word of the lord may stand forth clearly as it is said in another place the words of the lord are pure words silver tested in the fire or it may be that paul means the faulty glorying which comes of pride the glorying of those who think their hfe is righteous and glory as though they had not received it and this he says is cut out cast out and cast away not by the law of works but by the law of faith since it is by the law of faith that all must come to know that any good in their life is theirs by the grace of god and that their perfecting in the love of righteousness can come about in no other way 1 8 xi it is this consideration that makes a man god fearing for the fear of god what the greeks call theosebeia is the true wisdom the wisdom commended when man is told in the book of job behold the fear of god is wisdom 2 xhe greek word theosebeia might according to its derivation be trans lated the worship of god of which the essence lies in thank fulness of soul wherefore we are exhorted in our liturgy of the one true sacrifice to give thanks to the lord our god 43 but it will be thanklessness in the soul to attribute to itself that which comes to it from god above all to think of the works of righteousness as its own as acquired by itself for itself this is not the vulgar conceit of wealth or good looks or eloquence or of any of those good things of body mind or circumstance 39 rom 3 27 40 ps 68.30 where the vulg has ut excludant eos qui probati sunt argento augustine takes excludant here in the sense of exclusor meaning a silver worker and suggests that the word exclusa which correctly translates the greek in rom 3 27 may have the same sense the suggestion is cleaily impossible 41 ps 12 6 42 job 28 28 43 the beginning of the canon of the mass 208 augustine later works which may equally be possessed by wicked men it is a would be superior pride in those goods which properly belong to the good it is the fault which has caused even great men to fall away from the steadfastness of the divine being into the dishonour of idolatry so paul begins this same epistle in which he is to speak so powerfully on behalf of grace by acknowledging that he is debtor both to greeks and barbarians both to wise and unwise and ready therefore so much as in him lies to preach the gospel to them that were at rome tor i am not ashamed he says of the gospel for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the righteous liveth by faith this is the righteousness of god which was hidden in the old testament and is revealed in the new called the righteousness of god because god by imparting it makes man righteous even as it is the lord’s salvation by which he causes men to be saved and this is the faith from which and to which it is re vealed that is from the faith of those who proclaim it to the faith of those who are obedient to it by the faith of jesus christ the faith that is which christ has conferred upon us we believe that from god is given to us and will be given yet more fully the life of righteousness wherefore with that holy fear by which he alone is to be worshipped we give him thanks 19 xii with good reason the apostle turns at this point to denounce those who through the fault above mentioned have mounted of themselves like blown up bubbles into the empty air and fallen down not to rest but to be shattered on the stones of idolatry he had commended the true rehgion of faith by which we should show thankfulness to god for our justifica tion and now he opposes to it the contrary state for our abhor rence for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of those men who hold the truth in iniquity because that which is known concerning god is manifest in them for god has manifested it to them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood through the things which are made his eternal power also and divinity that they may be without ex cuse because though having a knowledge of god they glorified him not as god nor gave thanks but became empty in their thoughts and their foolish heart was darkened professing rom i 14 flf pg 3.8 the spirit and the letter 200 themselves to be wise they were made fools and changed the glory of the incorruptible god into the likeness of the image of corruptible man of birds of four footed beasts and creeping things notice that paul does not call them ignorant of the truth but says that they held the truth in iniquity and he does not fail to meet the natural question whence could they to whom god had not given the law have knowledge of the truth for he says that through the visible things of the creation they reached an understanding of the invisible things of the creator there have indeed been great minds who sought earnestly for truth this way and were able to find it in what then lies their ungodliness in that having come to know god they glori fied him not as god nor gave thanks but became empty in their thoughts emptiness is the peculiar disease of men who deceive themselves in the belief that they are something when they are nothing 4 s they enter into the shadow of that swelling hill of pride of whose foot the holy singer prays that it come not against him saying in thy light we shall see light thus they have turned away from the very light of changeless truth and their foolish heart is darkened for though they had known god their heart is not wise but foolish since they glorified him not as god nor gave thanks for to man he has said behold the fear of god is wisdom therefore pro fessing themselves to be wise which means simply ascribing this same wisdom to themselves they have been made fools 20 what need to tell the sequel through this godlessness those men those very men who were able through the creation to reach a knowledge of the creator have fallen because god resists the proud and to what depths they have sunk we may better learn from the following verses of the epistle than here describe it is not our purpose in this work to expound the epistle to the romans but to use its testimony to prove as surely as we may that the divine aid for the working of righteousness consists not in god’s gift of the law full as it is of good and holy commands but in that our will itself without which we cannot do the good is aided and uplifted by the imparting of the spirit of grace without that aid the teaching is a letter that killeth 46 rom i i8 ff 47 augustine is thinking of plato and the platonists whom he always re garded as having reached a genuine apprehension of god cx conf vii 9 48 gal 6 3 50 job 28 28 a.l.w 14 49 ps 36 1 1 9 51 james 4 6 210 augustine later works since it rather holds men m the guilt of transgression than justi fies the ungodly to those who gained knowledge of the creator through the creature that knowledge was of no avail unto salvation because knowing god they glorified him not as god nor gave thanks professing themselves to be wise even so those who through the law of god know how man ought to live are not justified by their knowledge since willing to establish their own righteousness they have not been subject to the righteousness of god 2 21 xiii we shall do well then to consider the difference between the law of works which does not cut out the glorying spoken of and the law of faith which does but this requires an effort of attention and discrimination one might hastily con clude that the law of works belongs to judaism and the law of faith to christianity on the ground that the jewish law pre scribes circumcision and suchhke works which christian prac tice has abandoned the error in this distinction is what we have all along been endeavouring to prove and it may be have proved already for clear thinking readers in particular for yourself and for the like of you yet the matter is important enough to warrant us for dwelling in its demonstration upon still further evidences the law of which paul speaks by which no man is justified is the same law which he says entered afterwards that the offence might abound 3 but he defends it against any ignorant argument or profane accusation what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid nay i have not known sin but by the law for i was unaware of concupiscence did not the law say thou shalt not covet sin therefore find ing its opportunity through the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence and again the law is holy and the commandment holy just and good but sin that it might appear sin wrought death in me by that which is good therefore the law which says thou shalt not covet is itself the letter that killeth and of it paul says in the words already quoted through the law is the knowledge of sm but now the righteousness of god without law has been manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of god through the faith of jesus christ unto all who believe for there is no distinction au have sinned and are in want of the glory of god being justified freely by his grace through the re demption that is in christ jesus whom god has set forth to make expiation through faith by his blood for the showing of his 52 rom 10.3 53 rom 5 20 54 rom 7 7 ff the spirit and the letter 2ii righteousness on account of the sins which have gone before under god’s forbearance to show his righteousness at this time that he may be just and the justifier of him who is of the faith of jesus then follows the text with which we are now dealing where then is thy glorying it is cut out by what law of works nay but by the law of faith this law of works then is that same law which says thou shalt not covet because by it is the knowledge of sin i chal lenge anyone to tell me whether the law of faith does not say thou shalt not covet if it does not why may not we who stand under it sin with freedom and impumty for that is what the apostle was supposed to imply by those of whom he writes as some affirm that we say let us do evil that good may come whose judgment is just 56 but if the law of faith also says thou shalt not covet as is constantly testified aloud by so many evangelic and apostolic precepts why is not it too called a law of works because it no longer has the works of the old ordinances circumcision and the like it does not follow that the matter of its own ordinances adapted to our own time are not works there was no question of the works of these ordi nances 56a when reference was made to the law in respect that through it is the knowledge of sin and accordingly no one by it is justified so that glorying is cut out not by it but by the law of faith by which the just lives can it be that through the law of faith also comes the knowledge of sin since it too says thou shalt not covet 22 where then lies the difference to put it in a sentence what is enjoined with threatenings under the law of works is granted to behef under the law of faith the one says thou shalt not covet 57 the other says because i knew that no man can be temperate unless god grant it and that to know of whose gift it came was a part of wisdom i came near unto the lord and besought him 58 that is the wisdom which is called the fear of god wherewith is worshipped the father of light from whom is every good and perfect gift 59 he is worshipped by the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving that his worshipper may 55 rom 3 20 ff 56 rom 3 8 5 a ordinances translates augustine’s word sacr amenta the sacra ments of the old covenant have been replaced by others in the new both are works but not by them but by the moral law common to both covenants comes the knowledge of sin 57 ex 20 17 58 wisdom 8.21 note that augustine can quote apocrypha for the law of faith 59 james 1 17 212 augustine later works glory not in himself but in god o so by the law of works god says do what i command by the law of faith we say to god give what thou commandest the law commands that we may be advised what faith must do that the hearer of the command if he cannot as yet perform it may know what he should pray for if at once he can and performs it obediently he should know by whose gift he has that power for we have not received the spirit of this world says the same most con stant preacher of grace but the spirit which is of god that we may know those things which have been given to us by god what also is the spirit of this world but the spirit of pride by which was darkened the foolish heart of those who knew god but glorified him not as god by giving thanks the same spirit by which those men are deceived who being ignorant of god’s righteousness and willing to establish their own have not been subject to the righteousness of god he that knows from whom he may hope to receive that which he has not yet is more a child of faith i think than he who ascribes to himself what he has though better than either is he who both has and knows from whom he has it only let him not believe himself to be what as yet he is not and so fall into the offence of the pharisee who gave god thanks for what he had but asked for nothing to be given him as though he stood in need of nothing for the increase and perfecting of his righteousness the examination and discussion which we have carried out to the best of that power which the lord deigns to bestow has led us to conclude that man is not j’ustified by the precepts of the good life but only through the faith of jesus christ that is not by the law of works but by the law of faith not by the letter but by the spirit not by the deserts of our actions but by grace freely given 23 xiv the apostle’s reproof and correction of those upon whom circumcision was being urged may seem to indicate that what he calls the law is circumcision and similar legal obser vances which as shadows of what was to come are now rejected by christians who hold the reality of that which was promised in a figure through those shadows but the law by which he says that no man is justified is meant by him to be taken in the sense not only of those ordinances which were given to them as 60 ii cor 10 17 61 the famous prayer of conf x 40 which gave offence to pelagius aug de praedesl ii 53 62 i cor 2 12 63 luke 18 1 1 f the spirit and the letter 213 figures of the promise but also of the works in whose perfor mance is the life of righteousness whereto belongs the command thou shalt not covet to make our point the clearer let us look at the decalogue itself undoubtedly moses received on the mount a law to be ministered to the people written on tables of stone by the finger of god it is comprised in ten commandments among which there is no charge of circum cision nor of the animal sacrifices which by christians are no longer offered in these ten commandments apart from the observance of the sabbath i would ask what the christian is not bound to observe of the commands not to make or worship idols or any other gods but the one true god not to take god’s name in vain to honour parents to avoid fornication murder theft false witness adultery and the coveting of that which is another’s which among these commands can be said not to bind the christian it is impossible to suppose that what the apostle calls the letter that killeth is not this law written on the two tables but that of circumcision and the other ancient ordinances now done away for in the law of the tables comes thou shalt not covet the command by which says paul though it is holy and righteous and good sin deceived me and thereby slew me which can only be the letter killing 24 it is still more patent that in the context of the epistle to the corinthians where the saying occurs that the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life the letter can only mean the decalogue written upon the two tables the passage runs thus for ye are the epistle of christ ministered by us writ ten not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart and such trust have we through christ towards god not that we are fit to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who also hath made us fit ministers of the new covenant not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter idlleth but the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death formed in letters of stone was made in glory so that the children of israel could not stedfastly look upon the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which is being done away why shall not the ministration of the spirit be yet more in glory for if the ministration of condemnation is glory much more shall the ministration of righteousness abound in glory on this text much might be said but it may be more in place later for the moment note what is meant by the letter that ex 31 18 deut 9 10 11 cor 3.2 ff augustine later works 214 killeth contrasted with the spirit that giveth life unques tionably it is the ministration of death formed in letters of stone the ministration of condemnation because the law entered afterw’ards that the offence might abound 6 commandments themselves are profitable and wholesome to the doer so much so that only the doer of them can have life but can the decalogue be called the letter that killeth because of that one commandment which it includes concerning the sab bath on the ground that to continue the literal observance of that day is to be carnally minded and to be carnally minded is death can it be diought that the other nine command ments which it is still right to observe as they are written belong not to the law of works by which no man is justified but to the law of faith by which the just lives it would be absurd to suppose that the ministration of death formed in letters of stone applies not to all ten commandments but to the single one which deals with the sabbath what then are we to make of the texts the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgi'ession until the law sin was in the world but sin was not imputed when there was no law by the law is the knowledge of sin those words so often quoted and above all the saying that admits no doubt as to its reference i was un aware of concupiscence did not the law say thou shalt not covet 25 consider the whole of this last passage and see whether it has any reference at ail to circumcision sabbath or any ordinance that is a shadow of things to come or is not entirely concerned to show that the letter forbidding sin does not give life to man but rather kius through increasing con cupiscence and filling up iniquity with transgression did not grace bring deliverance through the law of faith which is in christ jesus when charity is shed abroad in our hearts through the holy spirit which is given to us paul has just said o that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter and he continues what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid nay i have not known sin but by the law for i was unaware of con cupiscence did not the law say thou shalt not covet but sin finding its opportunity through the commandment worked in me all manner of concupiscence for without the law sin is dead at one time i lived without the law but when the command er rom 5 20 67 rom 8 6 68 rom 4 15 5 13 3 20 7 7 heb 10 1 70 rom 7 6 ff the spirit and the letter 215 ment came sin revived and i died and the commandment which was ordained unto life i found to be unto death for sin finding its opportunity through the commandment deceived me and by it slew me so the law indeed is holy and the com mandment is holy and just and good was then that which is good made death unto me god forbid but sin that it may appear sin has worked death for me through that which is good that sin through the commandment may become exceed ing sinful for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin for that which i work i know not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that i do if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good but as it is it is no more i that work it but sm that dwelleth in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh good dwelleth not for to will is present with me but to perform the good is not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that which i would not it is no more i that work it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see an other law in my members warring against the law of my mind and making me captive in the law of sm which is in my mem bers o wretched man that i am who shall dehver me from the body of this death the grace of god through jesus christ our lord therefore i myself with the mind serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin 26 thus it is manifest that the oldness of the letter if the newness of the spirit be lacking rather makes men guilty by the knowledge of sm than delivers them from sin with which agrees the saying in another place he that addeth to knowledge addeth to sorrow 2 vjqt that the law itself is an evil thing but that it holds the good commandment in the letter that demonstrates not in the spirit that brings aid and if the com mandment be done through fear of penalty and not through love of righteousness it is done in the temper of servitude not freedom and therefore it is not done at all for there is no good fruit which does not rise from the root of charity the man in whom is the faith that works through love begins to delight in the law of god after the inward man and that delight is a 71 so the latin versions in place of i thank god or thanks be to god in the greek 72 eccl 1 18 73 because the new commandment is the paradoxical command to love 74 gal 5 6 augustine later works 216 gift not of the letter but of the spirit it will work even though there be still another law in the members warring against the law of the mind until all that is old be changed and pass into that newness which day by day has increase in the inward man as the grace of god delivers us from the body of this death through jesus christ our lord 27 xv this grace lay hidden in the old testament under a veil it is revealed in the gospel of christ according to that perfectly ordered dispensation of history by which the wisdom of god disposes all things in their time perhaps we may discern its concealment in the fact that in the decalogue given on mount sinai the only thing hidden under a figurative command is that which concerns the sabbath the sabbath is a day of sanctification it is not for nothing that among all the works which god made the word sanctification is uttered first at that point when he rested from all his works this is not the place to discuss that matter it is enough for our present ques tion to observe that with good reason was the people com manded to abstain on that day from all servile work which signifies sin for to abstain from sin belongs to sanctification that is to the gift of god through the holy spirit and this alone among the commandments of the law written on the two tables of stone is set under the shadow of a figure whereby the jews observe the sabbath to signify that in that time there was a hiding away of that grace which was to be revealed in the new testament through christ’s passion as by the rending of the veil 77 jor when thou shalt pass over unto christ says paul the veil shall be taken away 28 xvi now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty this is the spirit of god by whose gift we are justified hereby it comes to pass in us that we find our delight m not sinning which means liberty whereas apart from the spirit we find delight in sinning which means servitude from the works of which we are to abstain that is keep sabbath m the spirit that holy spirit through whom charity which is the fulness of the law is shed abroad in our hearts is also called in the gospel the finger of god that those tables of the law were written by the finger of god and that the finger of god is god’s spirit through whom we are sanctified so that kving by faith we may do good works through love how striking here is 75 gen 2 3 7 5 lev 23 7 etc 77 matt 27.51 78 ii cor 3 16 f 79 luke 11.20 the spirit and the letter 217 at once the agreement and the difference fifty days are counted from the celebration of passover which was com manded through moses to be a figure signifying by the killing of a lamb the lord’s passion that was to be unto the day when moses received the law on tables written by the finger of god so and in like manner after the fulfilment of fifty days from the killing and the resurrection of him who was led as a lamb to the slaughter si the faithful assembled together were filled by the finger of god which is the holy spirit 29 xvii in this wonderful agreement there is the very great difference that in the old testament the people is held back by a fearful dread from approaching the place where the law was given s 2 whereas in the new the holy spirit comes upon those who were assembled together waiting for his promised coming there the finger of god worked upon tables of stone here upon the hearts of men so there the law was set outside men to be a terror to the unjust here it was given within them to be their justification for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment written as we know upon those tables ht is briefly comprehended said the apostle in this saying thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself love worketh not a neighbour’s ill and charity is the fulness of the law s 3 this law is not written on tables of stone but is shed abroad in our hearts through the holy spirit which is given to us therefore the law of god is charity to it the mind of the flesh is not subject neither indeed can be but when to put fear into the mind of the flesh the works of charity are written upon tables we have the law of works the letter killing the tiansgressor when charity itself is shed abroad in the heart of believers we have the law of faith the spirit giving life to the lover 30 now observe the tallying of this distinction with those words of the apostle which we quoted a while ago for another purpose and postponed their closer consideration ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart he points you see to the fact that the one is written outside the man to be a 80 deut 16 9 ff the harvest festival of pentecost was held in later judaism to commemorate the giving of the law 81 isa 53 7 82 ex 19 10 ff 84 rom 8.7 83 rom 13 9 f 85 ii cor 3 3 ff augustine later works 218 terror to him from without while the other is written in the man himself to justify him from within by the fleshy tables of the heart he means not those of the mind of the flesh but that which is hving and conscious in contrast with the unfeeling stone when he says further on that the children of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses who therefore spoke to them through a veil that signifies that the letter of the law justifies no man but a veil is set over the reading of the old testament until we pass over unto christ and the veil is taken away that is pass over unto grace and understand that from him we have the justification whereby we do what he com mands he commands in order that we may take refuge with him when in ourselves we fail and so when paul has said that we have such confidence through chnst unto god he is most careful to add at once his explanation lest this be attributed to our own strength not that we are fitted to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life 31 xviii accordingly it is because the law as he says elsewhere was set because of transgression that is the letter written outside the man that he calls it the ministration of death and the ministration of condemnation whereas the other that of the new testament he calls the ministration of the spirit and the ministration of righteousness because through the gift of the spirit we work righteousness and are delivered from the condemnation of transgression so the one is done away while the other remains since the tutor who puts in fear 87 shall be removed when fear has given place to charity for where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty that this ministration proceeds not from our deservings but from mercy is stated thus therefore seeing that we have this ministration as hav ing obtained mercy let us not be weakened but cast away the hidden things of confusion not walking in craftiness nor falsify ing the word of god by deceit by this craftiness and deceit he indicates that hypocrisy of the proud will that seeks to be accounted righteous so in the psalm which our apostle quotes in testimony of this same grace we read blessed is he to whom the lord hath not imputed sin nor is there deceit in his mouth 88 that is the confession of humble saints not boasting themselves to be what they are not and so paul continues for we preach not ourselves but jesus christ as lord and 86 gal 3 19 87 gal 3 25 ss ps 32 2 rom 4 8 the spirit and the letter siq ourselves as your servants for jesus sake because god who com manded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts the light of the knowledge of his glory upon the face of jesus christ it is the knowledge of his glory v hereby we know that he is the light by which our darkness is enlightened ob serve how he insists upon this very point but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be god’s and not of us then in more copious enlargement upon the same grace in the lord jesus christ he goes on to speak of that clothing with the righteousness of faith clothed wherewithal we may not be found naked and how for this cause we groan burdened as we are with mortality and desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life and he adds now he that hath wrought us for the self same thing is god who hath given us the earnest of the spirit and later concludes that we may be the righteousness of god in him the righteousness of god not that by which he is righteous but that by which we are made so by him 32 xix this and this only is the christian faith from which no christian should stray a man may shrink from saying in so many words that we make ourselves righteous without the grace of god working the same m us because he sees such claims to be intolerable to the faithful and devout but we must refuse the argument that we cannot be righteous without the operation of god’s grace merely because god gave the law instituted the teaching delivered good precepts for all this apart from the spirit’s aid is indubitably the letter that killeth only when the life giving spirit is present does he cause to be written within and loved that which when it was written externally the law caused to be feared 33 look for a moment at the magnificent testimony ren dered to this truth in the words of the prophet 9 behold the days come saith the lord when i will consummate upon the house of israel and the house of judah a new covenant not according to the covenant that i made for their fathers in the day when i took their hand to bring them forth from the land of egypt because they have not continued in my covenant and i have let them go saith the lord for this is the covenant that i will ordain for the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their heart and will write them upon their mind and i will be their god and they shall be my jer 31 31 ff 220 augustine later works people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every man ids brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them be cause i will forgive their iniquity and their sins will i remember no more what shall we say of this in the old testament it is difficult if not impossible to find outside this prophetic passage any men tion of the new covenant in express terms in many places it is signified or predicted but not by its actual name consider then carefully the difference between the two covenants the old and the new to which god here bears witness 34 after the words not according to the covenant that i made for their fathers in the day when i took their hand to bring them forth from the land of egypt it goes on because they have not continued in my covenant it is accounted their fault that they have not abided by the covenant of god lest it should appear that the law which then they received was to be blamed it is the same law which christ came not to destroy but to fulfil though the ungodly are justified not through that law but through grace that is by the action of the life giving spirit apart from whom the letter kills for if there had been a law given which could have given life righteousness would be altogether by the law but the scripture hath shut up all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe by this promise that is by the goodness of god the law is fulfilled without it men are made trans gressors whether in the actual doing of the evil work where the flame of concupiscence has swept across the barrier of fear or at least in the will if fear of punishment overcomes the attrac tion of desire the saying that the scripture hath shut up all under sm that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe shows the advantage of the shut ting up it is for the purpose presently named before faith came we were kept in ward under the law shut up unto the faith which afterwards hath been revealed the law was given that grace might be sought grace was given that the law might be fulfilled for the non fulfilment of the law was not through its own fault but the fault of the mind of the flesh a fault which the law must exhibit and grace must heal what the law could not do in that it was made weak through the flesh god sent his son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and in regard to sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the 90 gal 3.21 ff the spirit and the letter 221 law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit so we read in the prophetic testimony i will consummate upon the house of israel and upon the house of judah a new covenant consummate meaning fulfil not according to the covenant that i made for their fathers in the day that i took their hand to bring them forth from the land of egypt 35 xx this was the old covenant because the other is new but why should they be distinguished as old and new if through the new covenant is fulfilled the same law which in the old said thou shalt not covet the answer is that they have not continued in my covenant and i have let them go saith the lord it is because of the sickness of the old man which the commands and the threatenings of the letter did nothing to heal that the former covenant is called old and the latter new with the newness of the spirit which heals the new man from his old failing the words that follow set in the clearest light that truth which the self confident refuse to look upon for this is the covenant that i will ordain for the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their heart and will write them upon their mind now we understand those words of the apostle above quoted not on tables of stone but on tables of the heart because not with ink but by the spirit of the living god the reason surely for his mentioning the new covenant in this passage where he says who also hath made us fit ministers of the new covenant not of the letter but of the spirit must be that he had this prophecy in mind when he wrote the words not on tables of stone but on fleshy tables of the heart for in the same prophecy where the new covenant is promised by that name it is also said i will write them upon their hearts 36 xxi it follows that the laws of god written by god himself upon the heart are nothing but the very presence of the holy spirit who is the finger of god the presence by which charity the fulness of the law and the end of the command ment is shed abroad in our hearts the promises of the old covenant are earthly promises certain of its ordinances were shadows of things to come such as circumcision the sabbath and other observances of days rules as to particular foods and the manifold ceremonial of sacrifices and holy rites adapted to the old era of a fleshly law and the yoke of servitude it is true that apart from these the old covenant contained precepts 91 rom 8 3 ff 222 augustine later works of righteousness such as we are still enjoined to observe especially those which are set forth in the two tables with a literal and not allegorical significance as thou shalt not com mit adultery thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not covet and any other commandment which is summed up in this say ing thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself nevertheless the promises there announced as i have said are earthly and temporal good things of this corruptible flesh even though they may be figures of the eternal and heavenly goods belonging to the new covenant whereas now there is promised a good of the heart itself a good of the mind a spiritual good in the words put my laws in their mind and write them in their hearts they are to receive in other words not a law that menaces from without of which they must be m fear but the very law of righteousness dwelling widiin them which they are to love 37 xxii finally we are told of the reward i will be their god and they shall be my people this is that reward of which the psalmist speaks in his prayer for me to cleave unto god is good i will be their god and they shall be my people there can be no better good no happier happiness than this life for god hfe from god with whom is the well of life in whose light we shall see hght of that life the lord himself says this is hfe eternal that they may know thee the one true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent that is thee and jesus christ whom thou hast sent the one true god 55 that is his own promise to his lovers he that loveth me keepeth my commandments and he that loveth me is loved of my father and i will love him and will show myself unto him 56 show lumself in the form of god whereby he is equal to the father not in the form of a servant whereby he showed himself to the ungodly also for then shall it be done as it was written let the ungodly be taken away that he see not the glory of the lord 57 when they on the left hand shall go into everlasting fire but the righteous into life eternal we have heard the definition of eternal life that they may know the one true god with this agrees the saying of john beloved we are the sons of god and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be we know that when he appears we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is 58 that likeness begins now to be 92 rom 13 9 93 ps 73 28 94 ps 36 9 95 john 17 3 augustine twists the text to make it conform to orthodox doctrine 96 john 14.21 97 isa 26 10 98 i john 3.2 the spirit and the letter 223 formed again while man is renewed within from day unto day according to the image of him who created him 99 38 xxiii but between this and the perfection of that excellency which is then to be what comparison is possible the apostle applying to those unspeakable things such distant analogy as he may from the familiar world contrasts the age of infancy with the age of manhood when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things and he goes on to point the bearing of his parable now we see in a mirror darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know as also i have been known 39 xxiv in the same way the word given to the prophet whose testimony we are examining leads to this indication that in god is our reward in god our end in god the perfection of our happiness in god the sum of blessed and eternal life after the saying i will be their god and they shall be my people there follows immediately and they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least unto the greatest of them assuredly the time of the new covenant promised through the prophet in the words of the passage quoted is already here with us why then is it still said by everyone to his neighbour and his brother know the lord is it not said when the gospel is preached when it is the very aim of the gospel’s preaching that this be said everywhere does not the apostle call himself the teacher of the gentiles because it is happening as he says how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed or how can they believe in him whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher since then this preaching is now multiplied in all the world how can it be the time of the new covenant of which the prophet has written they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least unto the greatest of them we can only understand that here has been added the promise of that same new covenant’s eternal reward which is the most blessed contemplation of god himself 40 all from the least unto the greatest of them will then mean all who spiritually belong to the house of israel and the house of judah that is the sons of isaac the seed of abraham for that is the promise given in the words in isaac shall thy 99 col 3 10 ii cor 4 16 1 i cor 13 11 ff rom 10 14 augustine later works 224 seed be called for they which are sons of the flesh are not the sons of god but the sons of promise are counted for the seed and this is the word of promise at this time will i come and sara shall have a son and not only this but rebecca also con ceiving by our father isaac two children at one time of whom when they were not yet bom nor had done anything good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her that the elder shall serve the younger that is the house of israel or the house of judah because of christ’s coming of the tribe of judah the house of the sons of promise which means a house founded not on their own works but on the gracious act of god for god promises that which he does himself the promise is not his and the doing another’s which would be predicting not promising so it is not of works but of him that calleth that it be not their own doing instead of god’s lest the reward be reckoned not of grace but of debt and so grace be no more grace grace whose powerful vindicator and maintainer is the least of the apostles who laboured more than they all yet not he but the grace of god with him to return to the text they shall all know me all are the house of israel and the house of judah inasmuch as not all are israel that are of israel but those who are addressed in the psalm entitled for taking up in the morning which we may interpret for the new dawn or the dawn of the new covenant magnify him the whole seed of jacob let all the seed of israel fear him the whole seed without exception tmly all the seed of the promised and the called but the called according to his purpose for whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified therefore it is of faith that according to grace the promise may be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law which descends from the old covenant to the new but to that also which is of faith not a seed which has already received the law but of the faith of abraham that is to those that copy the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have set thee as a father of many nations 8 in sum these all predestinate called justified glorified shall know god through the grace of the new covenant from the least unto the greatest of them 3 rom 9 7 ff rom 4 4 s i cor 15.9 f ps_ 22.33 for the title cf r.v mg the lxx gives for the momuig slid 7 rom 8 28 30 rom 4 16 f the spirit and the letter 225 41 thus the law of works written on tables of stone and its reward in the land of promise which the house of israel accord ing to the flesh received after it was dehvered out of egypt be longs to the old covenant whereas the law of faith written in the heart and its reward in the immediate vision of god which the spiritual house of israel shall enjoy when it is delivered from this world belongs to the new covenant for then it shall be as the apostle says whether there be prophecies they shall be brought to nought whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall be brought to nought he speaks of that knowledge of children in which our life here passes a knowledge in part through a mirror darkly for because of it prophecy is needed while past still gives place to future because of it there is use for tongues the variety of mean ings whereby one thing is conveyed by another in allegory to the mind that cannot yet contemplate in purity the eternal light of transparent truth but when that which is perfect has come and all that is in part has been done away then the word which took flesh to appear to flesh shall show himself to his lovers then it will be life eternal for us to know the one true god then we shall be like him for then we shall know as we have been known then they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know him from the least of them unto the greatest of them we may understand this in more than one sense perhaps it means that there also the saints differ from one another in glory as star from star o it is all one whether we say from the least unto the greatest or from the greatest unto the least and this will hold if we should understand by the least those who have attained only to faith and by the greatest those who have reached also to such understanding as in tliis life is possible of the incorporeal and changeless light 1 or may be the least means the later m time and the greatest the earlier for all at once are to receive the promised vision of god because they also foresaw better things for us that without us they should not be made perfect 12 and so the least are found to be the first since their waiting has been less as in the gospel par able of the penny received first by those who came last into the i cor 13 8 ff 10 i cor 15 41 u for augustine’s distinction of faith and understanding see de tnn introduction p pp 22 f 35 12 heb 11 40 226 augustine later works vineyard and there may well be some other way of which i cannot at the moment think of taking least and greatest in the text 42 xxv the point i have so laboriously endeavoured to make clear and on which i would have you concentrate your mind is this in this promise of a new covenant not according to the covenant before made with the people of israel upon their deliverance from egypt the prophet has nothing to say of a change of sacrifices or outward ordinances of any kind although that change was certainly to ensue in the manner we now see to which the same prophetic scripture in many other places bears witness he insists only upon this great difference between old and new that god would put his laws into the mind of those who should belong to the new covenant and write them on their hearts whence the apostle drew his not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not on tables of stone but on fleshy tables of the heart and that the everlasting reward of this justification or being made righteous is not the land from which were driven amorites hittites and the rest of the nations recorded as dwelling in it but god himself unto whom to cleave is good the love of whose goodness is the love of him self from whom men are separated by nothing but their sins which are remitted only by his grace that is why the words they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them are followed by the promise i will forgive their iniquity and their sins i will remember no more by the law of works the lord says thou shalt not covet by the law of faith the lord says without me ye can do nothing meaning the good works which are the fruit of the vine branches grasp this clear difference between the old covenant and the new that there the law is written upon tables here upon hearts so that the fear imposed by the first from without be comes the delight inspired by the second from within and he whom the letter that killeth there made a transgressor is here made a lover by the spirit that giveth life then you can no longer say that god assists us in the working of righteousness and works in us both to will and to do according to his good pleasure inasmuch as he makes us hear with the outward sense the commandments of righteousness no it is because he gives increase within us by the shedding abroad of charity in our hearts through the holy spirit which is given to us 43 xxvi a difficulty however may be raised by the 13 matt 20.8 ff 14 john 15 5 the spirit and the letter 227 apostle’s words when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts is does not this obscure the differ ence of the new covenant in which the lord promised to write his laws in the hearts of his people if the gentiles have that by nature we are presented with a serious problem which is not to be shirked the argument will run if god distinguishes the new covenant from the old in that he wrote his law upon tables in the old covenant but upon hearts in the new how are the faithful of the new covenant istinguished from the gentiles who have the word of the law written in their hearts by which they do by nature the things contained in the law it would seem that they have the advantage over the old israel who re ceived the law upon tables and the priority over the new to whom is conferred by the new covenant only that which nature has conferred upon the gentiles 44 it is possible that the gentiles of whom the apostle speaks as having the law written in their hearts are those who belong to the new covenant let us see how he comes to speak of them first he sets out the virtue of his gospel it is the power of god unto salvation to every man that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for the righteousness of god is revealed in it from faith to faith as it is written the just liveth by faith 1 then he speaks of the ungodly whose pride made even the knowledge of god of no avail to them because they glorified him not as god nor gaye thanks then he passes to those who judge and yet do the things which they condemn this no doubt refers to the jews who made their boast in the law of god though he does not at first name them expressly wrath and indignation he says tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the jew first and also of the greek but glory honour and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the greek for there is no acceptance of persons with god for as many as have sinned without law shall perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified 17 and this brings him to the matter of our question he goes on for when ae gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law and so on as above quoted accordingly we may think that 1 rom 2 14 f i rom i 16 n rom 2 8 ff 228 augustine later works those here called gentiles are none other than those before referred to under the name of greek in the phrase to the jew first and also to the greek the gospel is the power of god unto salvation to every man that beheveth the jew first and also the greek but wrath and indignation tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the jew first and also of the greek but glory honour and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the greek now if it is this greek who is signified under the gentiles who do by nature the things contained in the law and have the work of the law written in their hearts clearly these gentiles who have the law written in their hearts belong to the gospel they are believers to whom it is the power of god unto salvation how could paul promise glory honour and peace to the good works of gentiles placed outside the grace of the gospel be cause there is no acceptance of persons with god and not the hearers but the doers of the law are justified he argues that all whether jew or greek that is all behevers of the gentiles shall alike have salvation in the gospel for there is no differ ence as he says later all have sinned and are in want of tlie glory of god being justified freely by his grace how could he maintain that the greek doer of the law is justified apart from the grace of the saviour 45 the words the doers of the law shall be justified cannot mean that they are justified by works and not by grace that would be to contradict his own statement that a man is justified freely by faith apart from the works of the law where the word freely means simply that works do not come before justification this he makes plain in another place if by grace then not of works else grace would be no longer grace that the doers of the law shall be justified must be taken in the sense that they can be doers of the law if and only if they be justified so that justification dqes not follow but precede the doing the word justified is equivalent to made righteous made righteous by him who justifies the ungodly so that he who was ungodly becomes righteous the statement men s h ll be made free could only be understood to mean that freedom comes to persons who are already men but the statement men shall be created could not possibly denote the creation of already existing men it means the bringing of men into being as such by the act of creation similarly if we were told that the doers of the law shall be honoured we should properly roin 3 aaf rom 3 38 o rom 11 6 the spirit and the letter 229 understand that honour is to be given to those who are already doers of the law but to say that the doers of the law shall be justified is equivalent to saying that the just shall be justified for doers of the law are ipso facto we must take it therefore in the same way as we should understand the doers of the law shall be created not because they were but in order that they may be so it should be made clear even to the jewish hearers of the law that they need the grace of the justifier in order that they may become doers 21 alternatively we must suppose that shall be justified here means shall be held just shall be accounted just as in the case of the lawyer in luke of whom we read and he willing to justify himself 22 that is with a view to being held or accounted just so we say that god sanc tifies his saints in a sense different from that of the prayer let thy name be sanctified in the one case sanctify means that god himself makes saints of men who were not saints in the other we pray that what is ever holy in itself may be held by men as holy may be feared in holy wise 46 in speaking then of gentiles who do by nature the things contained in the law and have the work of the law writ ten m their hearts paul may have intended those who believe in christ because they come to the faith without having re ceived the law beforehand as the jews then we have no need to distinguish them from those to whom the lord promised the new covenant by the prophet saying that he would write his laws in their hearts because they also by the grafting done to the wild olive belong to the one olive tree the one people of god 24 in this way the apostolic testimony will be in accord with the prophetic to belong to the new covenant will be to have the law of god written not on tables but on hearts that is to embrace with inward affection the righteousness of the law in which faith works through love for god justifies the gen tiles by faith as scripture foresees in the prediction to abraham that in thy seed shall all the nations be blessed 25 by this grace of the promise the wild olive was to be grafted into the olive tree and the faithful gentiles become sons of abraham in abraham’s seed which is christ 26 following the faith of him who before any law was given upon tables and not yet having 21 this characteristically over subtle piece of exegesis is the result of augustine’s misunderstanding of the pauline justification in what follows here he glances at the possibility of a forensic interpretation of the word 22 luke 10 29 23 matt 6 9 24 rom 11 24 gtn 12 3 26 gal 3 8 16 augustine later works 230 received circumcision believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness so the saying of the apostle about these gentiles that they have the work of the law written in their hearts will be comparable with his words to the corin thians not on tables of stone but on fleshy tables of the heart they become members of the house of israel when their uncir cumcision is counted for circumcision inasmuch as they do not display the righteousness of the law by the cutting of the flesh but keep it in charity of heart for if the uncircumcision keeps the righteous requirements of the law will not its uncircum dsion be counted for circumcision therefore they are sharers in the new covenant in the house of the true israel wherein is no guile because god puts his laws in their minds and writes them in their hearts with his finger the holy spirit by whom there is shed abroad in those hearts the charity which is the fulness of the law 47 xxvii this interpretation need not be disturbed by the saying of the text that they do the things contained in the law by nature not by the spirit of god by faith or by grace for it is the work of the spirit of grace to renew in us the image of god in which by nature we were made the fault in man is contrary to his nature and is just that which grace heals the grace besought in the prayer have mercy on me heal my soul for i have sinned against thee 29 accordingly it is always by nature that men do the things contained in the law those who fail so to do fail by their own fault by that fault the law of god was effaced from men’s hearts and so when it is written there through the heahng of the fault the things contained m the law are done by nature not that nature is the denial of grace but that grace is the mending of nature for by one man sin entered into the world and through sin death and so it passed into all men in whom all sinned there fore since there is no difference all are m want of the glory of god being justified freely by his grace by grace the righteousness which guilt had effaced is written in the inward man thus renewed and this is god’s mercy upon the human race through jesus christ our lord for there is one god and one mediator also between god and men the man christ jesus 32 2 gen i 5 6 28 rom 2 26 29 ps 41 4 39 rom 5 12 the m quo orrmes pecccaiermt of augustine's latin version misrepresents the original greek 31 rom 3 22 ff 32 i tim 2 5 the spirit and the letter 231 48 if this interpretation is rejected and if those who do by nature the things contained in the law are not to be reckoned among those who are justified by the grace of christ then they must belong to the number of the heathen who worship not the true god in truth and righteousness and yet do some things known to us from books observation or report which judged by the standaird of right conduct call not only for the withholding of blame but even for merited and proper commendation it is true that enquiry into the end or purpose of such actions would make it less easy to discover any that deserve the praise or the defence due to genuine righteousness 3 xxviii yet we must remember that the image of god in the human soul has not been so completely obhterated by the stain of earthly affections that no faint outhnes of the original remain therein and therefore it can rightly be said even in the ungodliness of its life to do or to hold some parts of the law this may possibly be meant by the saying that the gentiles who have not the law that is the law of god do by nature the things contained in the law and that such men are a law unto themselves and have the work of the law written in their hearts namely that the imprint of god’s image in their creation has not been altogether effaced 3 but even so there will be no shaking of the difference between old and new covenant whereby the writing of the law of god in the hearts of the faith ful through the new is opposed to its writing upon tables through the old for what is now written by way of renewal is what was not altogether effaced by growing old just as by the new covenant there is a renewal in the mind of believers of that very image of god which ungodliness had not entirely done away at the least there remained the essential rationality of the human soul so even here what is written is undoubtedly that law of god which was never quite effaced by unrighteousness and now is renewed by grace this writing which is justification could not be made effective in the jews by the law written on tables its effect was only transgression men indeed they were and there was in them that natural impulse which gives the rational creature both a certain awareness of what is lawful and a certain 33 augustine could say de cw xix 25 that the virtues of the heathen are to be accounted vices rather than virtues because they are not referred to gkid 1 e god is not acknowledged as their source and the love of him is not their motive it is worth noting however that the phrase splendida vitia is not augustinian see mausbach die ethik des heil augustuws vol ii pp 258 ff 34 of the important passage m de trm xiv 21 xv 2 2 augustine later works power of doing it but the religion that conveys to another life of blessedness and eternity possesses a law unspotted con verting souls 35 so that they receive of that light renewal and fulfilment of that which is written the light of thy countenance o lord is marked upon us 36 if men turn aside from it they have deserved that it should fade away renewal save by the chnstian grace which is the mediator’s intercession they can not have for there is one god and one mediator also between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself to be the redemption of all and if those of whom we are speaking those who do by nature the things contained in the law in the manner we have sufficiently set forth are strangers from the grace of christ then the thoughts which excuse them can advantage them nothing in the day when god shall judge the hidden things of men unless it be for a punishment less severe even as the righteous man is not held back from eternal life by those venial sins of which some in this life there must be so for eternal salvation the ungodly has no advantage from some good works which even in the life of the worst of men can scarcely be altogether absent but as in god’s kingdom the saints differ in glory like star from star so in the condemnation of everlasting punishment it will be more tolerable for sodom than for another city and some will be twofold more than others the children of hell 37 god’s judgment will not fail to take account of it if even in the ungodliness which must be condemned one has sinned more or less than another 38 49 the apostle is checking the self glorification of the jews he has said that not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified and he proceeds at once to speak of some who not having the law do by nature the things contained in the law what is the point here made if the reference is not to those who belong to the grace of the mediator but to those who without that worship of the true god which is true religion can yet show some good works in their ungodly life it may be that this is his way of proving what he had already said that there is no respect of persons with god 35 ps 197 36 ps 4 6 37 i cor 15 41 luke 10 12 matt 23 15 38 the council of carthage m a d 418 which condemned pelagiamsm rejected the belief in a middle place m the after life for unbaptized infants yet augustine himself coidd say that they would receive mitissima poena a very gentle penalty he clearly believes in degrees of punish ment as of reward see enchrid 23 29 and contrast the horrible argu ments of de civ xxi i 10 the spirit and the letter 233 and what he says later that god is not god of the jews only but also of the gentiles inasmuch as no works of the law how ever small could be found implanted by nature in those who have not received the law unless it came from the relics of the divine image which he in whom there is no respect of persons does not despise when they believe in him nevertheless whether we accept this interpretation or the other it holds good that the grace of god in the new covenant was promised also by the prophet and that this grace is defined as consisting in the writing of god’s laws in the hearts of men so that they come to that knowledge of god in which they shall not teach every man his neighbour or his brother saying know god for they shall all know him from the least unto the greatest of them and this is the gift of the holy spirit by which charity is shed abroad in our hearts that charity alone which is the love of god from a pure heart and a good conscience and a faith unfeigned 3 9 by it the righteous lives in his pilgrimage here and by it he is led on from mirror and dark saying and all that was in part to the region of sight that he may know face to face as also he has been known one thing he seeks from the lord and re quires the same that he may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of his life to the end that he may contemplate m de light the fair beauty of the lord i 50 xxix no man therefore may boast of that which he seems to have as though he has not received it j or think that he has received it because the letter that comes from without has been set down for his reading or made to sound for his hear ing for if righteousness is by the law then christ has died for nought 43 if he has not died for nought he has ascended up on high led captivity captive and given gifts unto men 44 whoever has anything has it from thence whoever denies that he has it from thence either has it not or else that which he has shall be taken away from him 4 5 for there is one god who justifies the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith 46 the change of preposition does not indicate any difference of meaning but serves simply to vary the phrase elsewhere speaking of the gentiles that is the uncircumcision he says the scripture foreseeing that god justifies the gentiles by faith 47 and again speaking of the circumcision to which he himself belonged we jews by nature and not sinners of the 39 i tim 1 5 40 i cor 1312 4 i ps 27 4 42 i cor 4 7 43 gal 2.21 44 eph 4.8 45 luke 19.26 46 rom 3 30 47 gal 3 8 augustine later works 234 gentiles knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith of jesus christ we also have believed in christ jesus 48 here we have both the uncircumcision said to be justified by faith and the circumcision through faith yet only if the circumcision hold to the nghteousness of faith for the gentiles which followed not after righteousness have laid hold on righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith received it in answer to their prayer from god not by counting upon themselves but israel in following after the law of righteousness hath not attained to that law wherefore because it was not by faith but as though by works 49 as though they wrought it by themselves and not believing that god wrought it in them for it is god that worketh in us both to will and to work according to his good pleasure there fore they stumbled upon the rock of stumbling the mean ing of paufs actual words because it was not by faith but as though by works is made quite clear in a following verse for they being ignorant of the righteousness of god and desir ing to establish their own have not been subject to the righteousness of god for christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone that believeth 2 can we still have any doubt what are those works of the law by which a man is not justified if he regards them as his own apart from the help and gift of god which is by faith of jesus christ can we think for a moment of circumcision and such like because we read similar sayings about these ordinances in other places here at least it was not circumcision that they desired to establish as their own righteousness for circumcision itself was estabhshed by the command of god nor can we sup pose any reference here to those works of which the lord told them ye do reject the commandment of god that ye may set up your traditions 3 paul’s words are israel in following after the law of righteousness attained not unto that law 4 not following after their own traditions the contrast lies entirely in the point that they ascribed to themselves the keeping of the law thou shalt not covet and the rest of the holy and righteous commands of god man’s power to accomplish them is wrought in man by god through faith of jesus christ who is the end unto righteousness for everyone that believeth in whom that is to say everyone that is incorporated through the spirit 48 gal 2 15 f 49 rom 9 30 f so phil 2 13 51 rom 9.32 52 rom 10 3 53 matt 15.3 54 rom 9.31 the spirit and the letter 235 and made a member of him is enabled to work righteousness because he gives the increase from within of the works of such the lord himself has said that without me ye can do nothing 51 the righteousness of the law of which it is said that if a man do it he shall live in it 56 is set forth to this end that every man may recognize his own infirmity and so not in his own strength or through the letter of the law which cannot be but winning through faith the favour of the justifier may attain and do and live in it for the work which if a man do he shall live in it is done only by one who is justified and justification is granted to the prayer of faith of which it is written say not in thy heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down or who shall descend into the deep that is to bnng christ back from the dead but what saith the scripture the word is nigh thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that is says the apostle the word of faith which we preach for if thou confess with thy mouth that jesus is lord and hast believed in thy heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved 7 and righteous inasmuch as saved for by the same faith we believe that god raises up us also from the dead for the time present in spirit so that in newness of his grace we live soberly righteously and godly in this world and afterwards even in our flesh which shall rise again unto immortality such shall be the reward earned for flesh by spint which goes before it in a spiritual resurrection that is in justification for we have been buried with christ by baptism unto death that like as christ rose from the dead through the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life by faith of jesus christ is granted to us both the httle beginning of salva tion in possession and its perfecting which we await in hope for every one that shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved how countless is the sum of thy sweetness o lord as the psalm says which thou hast hidden from them that fear thee but perfected unto them that hope in thee from the law comes our fear of god from faith our hope in him but grace is hidden from those who are in fear of punish ment the soul that labours under that fear not yet victorious over evil concupiscence and still held in the stern ward of that same fear must take refuge by faith with the mercy of god that he may grant what he commands impart the sweet savour of 55 john 15 5 s6 lev 18.5 s rom 10 5 ff 58 titus 2 12 rom 6 4 50 rom 10 13 ps 31 19 augustine later works 236 grace and by his holy spirit make the delight of his precepts greater than the attraction which obstructs the keeping of them thus that countless sum of his sweetness the law of faith which is the love of him written and shed abroad in our hearts is perfected unto them that hope in him so that the healed soul may work that which is good not in fear of punishment but through love of righteousness 52 do we then make void freedom of choice through grace god forbid yea we establish freedom of choice 2 as the law is not made void by faith so freedom of choice is not made void but established by grace freedom of choice is necessary to the fulfilment of the law but by the law comes the knowledge of sin by faith comes the obtaining of grace against sin by grace comes the healing of the soul from sin’s sickness by the healing of the soul comes freedom of choice 3 j by freedom of choice comes the love of righteousness by the love of righteousness comes the working of the law and thus as the law is not made void but estabhshed by faith since faith obtains the grace whereby the law may be fulfilled so freedom of choice is not made void but established by grace since grace heals the will whereby righteousness may freely be loved all the links in that chain which i have drawn out are found speaking in the holy scriptures the law says thou shalt not covet faith says heal my soul for i have sinned against thee grace says behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto thee health restored says o lord my god i cned unto thee and thou hast healed me 57 free dom of choice says i will sacrifice freely unto thee love of righteousness says the unrighteous have spoken unto me of delights but not as thy law o lord why then must wretched men be bold to vaunt themselves either of their freedom of choice before they are made free or of their own strength if the freedom has been given them why will they not hear in the very words freedom of choice the meaning of liberty where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty how if they are slaves of sin can they boast freedom of choice for of whom a man is overcome to the same is he brought in bondage but if they have been made free why boast of it as though it were their own work and glory as though they had not received it 62 rom 3 31 63 see introduction p 189 65 ps 41 4 66 john 5 14 68 ps 54 6

the son shall make you free then shall ye be free indeed 72 53 xxxi in this hnked series which i have described the beginning of salvation or of the way to it appears to be faith the question will be asked is this faith itself placed in our own power it will help us to see the answer if we look somewhat more attentively into the nature of power willing is one thing abihty another willing does not necessarily imply ability nor ability willing we sometimes will what we are not able to do and sometimes are able to do what we do not will the latin words make it plain that wiu voluntas is derived from velle power potestas from posse he who wills has voluntas he who is able has potestas but will must be present for power to be operative we do not call an unwilling act the operation of power yet on a closer analysis it appears that even if you do a thing under compulsion unwillingly you do it by your will if you do it at all you are said to do it against your will that is unwillingly because you would prefer to act differently you are compelled to act because of some evil which it is your will to avoid or remove and so you act under compulsion if your will were strong enough to prefer the suffering of the evil to the doing of the act you would of course resist the compulsion and refuse the act thus if you act though it may not be with full or free will it can never be without willing and since the willing is carried into eflfect we cannot say that the actor was powerless if in yielding to compulsion you willed an act which you could not perform we should say that the will was present albeit forced but the power lacking but when you do not act because you will not the power is there but the will is lacking so long as your resistance to compulsion withholds the act that is why in the employment either of compulsion or of persuasion it may be said why not do what you have in your power in order to escape this evil and one who is altogether unable to do that which he is being pressed to do on the supposition of his abihty may reply with the excuse i would do it if it were m my power we have then a sufficient definition of power in the union of will with the capacity to act we say that any man has in his power that which he does if he wills and does not if he wills not 54 now consider the question we raised for investigation whether faith is in our power we are speaking of the faith with 72 john 15 5 8.36 1238 augustine later works which we respond in believing not of that which we give when we make a promise here too we speak of faith but we use the word in different senses when we say he had not faith in me and when we say he did not keep faith with me the meaning in the first case is he did not believe what i said in the second he did not do what he said by the faith where with we believe we are faithful to god by the faith wherewith his promises are performed god himself is faithful to us as the apostie says god is faithful in not suffering you to be tempted beyond that which you are able it is the faith whereby we believe god or believe in god of which we now ask whether it is in our power the faith of which it is written abraham be lieved god and it was counted unto him for righteousness and again unto him that believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness ask yourself then whether anyone can believe if he will not or not believe if he will the supposition is absurd for belief is simply consenting to the truth of what is said and consent is necessarily an act of will it follows that faith must be in our power but as the apostle says there is no power but of god 75 there can be no reason then for excluding this power from the application of the words what hast thou which thou hast not received 75 even our believing is a thing that god has granted to us but nowhere do we read in the holy scriptures that there is no will but of god and rightly so for it is not true else if there were no will but of him god would be the author of sins which god forbid for the evil will by itself is sin even if its effect be lacking that is if it have not power to act when the evil will receives power to accomplish its intent this comes of the judgment of god in whom there is no un righteousness his punishment is carried out in this way as well as in others and it is not the less just because it is hidden though the wicked man only knows he is being punished when manifest penalty makes him feel against his will the evil of the sin he wrought willingly this is the meaning of what the apostle says of certain sinners god gave them over unto the lusts of their heart to do the things winch are unfitting 77 and as the lord said to pilate thou couldest have no power against me unless it were given thee from above 78 but the giving of power is not the imposition of necessity the david who received the power 73 1 cor 10.13 74 rom 4 3 5 75 rom 13 1 a misapplied text 76 i cor 4 7 77 rom i 24 78 john 19 ii the spirit and the letter 239 to slay saul chose to spare and not to strike thus we under stand that the evil receive power for the condemnation of their evil will but the good for the proving of their good will 55 xxxii faith then is in our power because everyone believes when he wills and when he believes believes willingly we must next enquire or rather recall to mind what is the faith that the apostle urges upon us with such force of argument it is not any kind of beheving that is good or we should not be warned brethren believe not every spirit but test the spirit which is of god paufs words in his praise of charity believeth all things si do not mean that we should de preciate the charity of any man who does not at once believe everything he hears the same charity forbids us easily to believe any evil of a brother and counts it rather as a part of itself not to believe when it hears such evil spoken the charity that beheveth all things also beheves not every spirit we are not told that it believes all men it believes all things but its belief is given to god there can be no doubt that the faith commended by the apostle is that whereby god is believed 56 but a further distinction is required god may be be lieved as well by those who are under the law and try to work their own righteousness through fear of punishment so that they cannot work the righteousness of god for that is done by the charity that takes pleasure only in the lawful and not by the fear that is compelled to act lawfully while the will’s desire would be to have licence if that were possible for the unlawful they also believe god if they were devoid of such belief they would have no dread of the law’s punishment but this is not the faith commended by the apostle who says ye have not received the spirit of bondage again unto fear but ye have re ceived the spirit of the adoption of sons whereby we cry abba father this fear then is the fear of slaves and therefore although it renders belief to the master there is in it no love of righteousness but only the fear of damnation the cry of sons is abba father two words that belong one to the circum cision and the other to the uncircumcision to the jew first and also to the greek for there is one god that justifieth the cir cumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith 83 their cry is a petition and its object is that for which they hunger and thirst which can only be as it is written of them blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness 79 i sam 24 10 80 i john 4 1 8i i cor 13 7 82 rom 8 15 83 rom i 16 3 30 augustine later works 240 for they shall be filled to this blessedness they that are under the law must cross over the servants must become sons yet not ceasing to be servants but so as to render the free service of sons to their master and father for this too is what they have received he the only begotten hath given power to become sons of god unto them that believe in his name 85 he has counselled them to ask to seek to knock that they may receive and find and that it may be opened unto them to which he adds the rebuke of unbelief if ye being evil know how to give good gifts unto your sons how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him the law which is the strength of sin has fired the sting of death 87 so that sin taking occasion by the commandment works all manner of concupiscence 8 from whom then should we ask for continence but from him who knows how to give good gifts to his sons the unwise maybe is ignorant that none can have continence unless god give it89 that he may know it wisdom is what he needs let him listen then to the spirit of his father speaking through ghnst’s apostle or to chnst himself saying in his gospel ask and ye shall receive speaking also in his apostle and saying if any one of you lack wisdom let him ask of god who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given to him but let him ask in faith nothing doubting so this is the faith by which the righteous lives this is the faith that believes in him who justifies the ungodly this is the faith through which glorying is cut out si whether for the exclu sion of that which is self conceit or for the marking of that by which we glory in the lord this is the faith that gams the bountiful outpouring of the spirit of which it is said that we through the spirit await in faith the hope of righteousness s2 one may ask here whether righteousness is subject or object of the hope for the righteous who hves by faith does indeed hope for eternal life and the faith that hungers and thirsts after righteousness advances therein by the renewal of the inward man from day to day and hopes to be satisfied therewith in that eternal life where the words of the psalm shall come to pass who satisfieth thy desire with good things 8 this is the 84 matt 5 6 85 john 1 12 87 i cor 15 56 88 rom 7 8

faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man be lifted up for we are his making created in christ jesus in good works which god has prepared that we may walk therein this finally is the faith that works through love and not through fear not dreading punishment but lonpng for righteousness whence comes that love which is charity through which faith works but from the source that granted it to faith’s own petition there could be no spark of it in us however small were it not shed abroad in our hearts through the holy spirit which is given to us for this charity or love of god which is said to be shed abroad in our hearts is not his own love for us but that by which he makes us his lovers hke the righteousness of god by which we are made righteous through his gift or the salvation of the lord by which he causes us to be saved or the faith of jesus christ by which he makes us faithful that is the righteousness of god which he does not only teach by the com mandment of the law but gives by the bestowal of the spirit 57 xxxiii there is however a further question to which we should give some consideration is the will by which we believe also the gift of god or is it exerted by the freedom of choice which is implanted in us by nature if we say it is not god’s gift there is a danger of our supposing that we have found an answer to the apostle’s rebuke what hast thou that thou hast not received but if thou hast received it why dost thou glory as though thou hadst not received it we may retort that we have the will to believe which we have not received and that gives us room to glory because we have not received it if on the other hand we say that this act of will is nothing but the gift of god again there will be danger lest the infidel and the godless be thought to have good ground for excusing their own unbelief on the plea that god has refused to grant them the will when it is said that it is god who worketh in us both to will and to work according to his good pleasure we are already in the sphere of grace granted to faith in order that man may have the good works worked by faith through the love which is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit which is given to us but in order that this grace may be granted we believe and our belief is an act of will it is of this will that we ask whence it comes if by nature then why not to all since the same god is the creator of all if by the gift of god still why eph 2 8 ff 95 1 cor 4 7 phil 2 13 243 augustine later works to all since he will have all men to be saved and come to knowledge of the truth 58 here the first point to be made as a possible solution of difficulty is that the freedom of choice which the creator has conferred in the way of nature upon the rational soul is a iieutral power which can either be exerted to faith or sink into unbelief accordingly it cannot be said that in the act of will whereby a man believes god he possesses what he has not re ceived since it arises at god’s call from the freedom of choice which he received in the way of nature at his creation god wills men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth but not so as to deprive them of that freedom of choice for the good or evil use of which they are subject to the judgment of absolute justice by that judgment the unbelieving act against god’s will when they disbelieve his gospel yet what they do is uot to defeat his will but to cheat themselves of a supreme good and fall into the distress of punishment in which they must learn power of him whose mercy in his gifts they have despised thus the will of god is ever undefeated which would not be had he no way of dealing with his despisers or were there any escape for them from his sentence upon such suppose a master say these my servants work in the vineyard and after their labour rest and feast provided that any who will not so work shall grind for ever in the mill it might appear that one who should despise the order is acting against his master’s but he will only defeat it if in his master’s despite he escapes under the power of god is alto gether impossible so it is written god spoke once which we understand in the sense of unchangeably though it might also be taken to mean a single utterance and then we hear the patter of this unchangeable word these two things have i ard that power belongeth unto god and that mercy is thine who wilt render to every man according to his works ihe despiser of his mercy which calls for belief must bear under his power the sentence of condemnation but whosoever beheves and trusts himself to god for the absolution of all his sms for the healing of all his sicknesses for kindling and muinination by the warmth and light of god shall have by his grace those good works which lead to dehverance even in the 1 tim 2 4 note that in this treatise augustine does not find it necessary 98 h explain away this text cf enchind 103 rtere is the fatal distinction between god’s power and his mercy god’s wiu and his love 99 ps 62 1 1 f the spirit and the letter 243 body from the corruption of death to crowning and satisfaction with the good things which are not temporal but eternal above all that we ask or think 1 59 such is the order set forth in the psalm bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his rewardings who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thine infirmities who redeem eth thy life from corruption who crowneth thee with compas sion and mercy who satisfieth thy desire with good things 2 and lest we despair of all these good things because of that deformity of old age which is our mortality we hear the assur ance thy youth shall be renewed like that of an eagle as much as to say all this that thou hast heard belongs to the new man and the new covenant dwell on it all with me i pray you and take your delight in the praise of mercy which is the grace of god bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his rewardings not awardings but rewardings because he rewards evil with good who forgiveth all thine iniqmties that is done in the sacrament of baptism who healeth all thine infirmities that takes effect for the man of faith in this life wherein the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh so that we do not the things we would wherein the other law in our members wars against the law of the mind wherein to will is present but to perform the good is not these infirmities of old age if we persevere in going forward are healed by the daily increase of new hfe in the faith that works through love who redeemeth thy life from corruption that comes to pass in the final resurrection of the dead who crowneth thee with compassion and mercy that will be in the judgment then when the king of righteousness sits upon his throne to render unto every man according to his works who shall boast that he has a pure heart or is clean from sin here therefore there was need to speak of the lord’s compassion and mercy since in that judgment the exaction of debt and rendering of desert might seem to leave no place for mercy he wiu crown with compassion and mercy yet this too wiu be according to men’s works for it will be those set apart on his right hand who will hear him say i was hungry and thou gavest me to eat there is a judgment without mercy but it is to him that showed not mercy and blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy then those on the left hand shall go into everlasting burning but the righteous into hfe eternal and leph 3 ao 2ps i03 2ff 1 prov 20 8 f matt 25‘35 5 james 2 13 matt 57 44 augustine later works lccording to the saying that this is life eternal that they may mow thee the one true god and jesus christ whom thou hast ent so with that knowledge that vision that contemplation hall the desire of the soul be satisfied with good things that ind that alone suffices it it has nothing more to seek to long br to require it was the desire of that satisfaction that kindled he disciple’s heart who said to the lord christ show us the father and it sufficeth us and received the answer he that lath seen me hath seen the father for eternal life itself is that they may know the one true god thyself and jesus christ whom thou hast sent and if to have seen the son is to lave seen the father no doubt to see the father and the son is 0 see the holy spirit of the father and the son thus freedom of choice is undisturbed and yet our soul may dess the lord not forgetting all his rewardmgs it seeks not in gnorance of god’s nghteousness to establish its own but be ieves on him who justifies the ungodly and lives by faith till it e admitted into sight by that faith which works through love nd this love is shed abroad in our hearts not by the sufficiency f our own will nor by the letter of the law but by the holy ipirit which is given to us 6o xxxiv if this hne of argument be thought sufficient s answer to the question raised well and good it may how ver be replied that there is a danger of making god responsible dr the sin committed by freedom of choice if the reason for scribing to god’s gift the will to beheve in accordance with he saying what hast thou which thou hast not received e that it arises from that freedom of choice which we received a our creation but it should be observed that this is not the nly reason this act of will is attributable to the divine bounty lot only because it comes of the freedom of choice which was reated with us in the way of nature besides that god works or our willing and beheving through the inducement of im ressions which we experience whether the impressions be ex ernal as m the exhortations of the gospel in which case the aw’s commands have a certain effect if by warning a man of ds own weakness they make him seek refuge through believing vith the grace that justifies or internal as in the ideas which inter the mind willynilly though consent or refusal thereto is a natter of one’s own will in these ways does god work upon the easonable soul to believe indeed freedom of choice could pro luce no act of belief were there no inducement or invitation to john 17.3 7 john 14 8 the spirit and the letter 245 bekef assuredly then it is god who brings about in a man the very will to believe and in all things does his mercy anticipate us yet to consent to the cauing of god or to refuse it as i have said belongs to our own will which so far from conflicting with the text what hast thou which thou hast not received does even confirm it for the soul cannot receive and possess the gifts there spoken of but by consenting what it is to possess what it is to receive pertains to god the receiving and the possessing necessarily to him who receives and possesses there remains indeed the profound mystery why this suasion in one man is effective in another not if i am pressed to attempt its fathoming i can think at the moment of only two answers that i should like to give o the depth of the riches and is there any unrighteousness with god he whom the reply contents not may look for more instructed counsellors but let him beware of finding such as are over confident 6 1 xxxv it is time to end this book i cannot say whether its prolixity has achieved anything i do not mean for you whose faith i know but for the minds of those on whose account you desired me to write it is not against me but to refrain from any appeal to the authority of him who has spoken in his apostles certainly against no less an apostle than paul speaking not in a single text but in a long argument of such power intensity and vigilance that they must defend if they choose their own opinion instead of listening to him as he en treats by the mercy of god and bids them through the grace of god given unto him not to be wise overmuch beyond the wisdom that is fitting but to be wise in soberness according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith 62 but i may call your attention to the question which you put to me and to the upshot of my long and laboured argument you were perplexed by the statement that a man may be with out sin if the divine aid be seconded by his own will although there be no example past present or future of such perfect righteousness in this life in the work previously addressed to you i had stated the matter in these terms if i am asked whether a man can in this life be without sin i will allow that it is possible through the grace of god and the man’s free choice 8 for this passage see introduction p 190 9 rom 11 33 9.14 augustine habitually makes use of paul’s 0 altitudol in its context an outburst of praise for the great design of mercy upon all to quell heart searchmgs over the problem of predestination 10 rom 12 3 augustine later works 246 though i make no doubt that freedom of choice itself appertains to the grace of god that is to the things which he ves and not only its existence but its right direction its turning to per form the lord’s commands so that the grace of god not only shows what is right but also by its aid enables it to be done when it is shown you thought it irrational that there should be no example of a thing that is possible and so arose the enquiry of this book in which it lay on me to show that a thing may be possible even if example of it be lacking accordingly we ad duced instances at the beginning of our discussion from the gospel and the law such as the camel’s passing through the needle’s eye the twelve legions of angels that might have fought for christ had he so willed the nations which god said he could have destroyed all at once from the face of his people all being things that have not happened one might add what we read in the book of wisdom of the many strange torments which god could put forth against the wicked through the creature’s obedience to his order 12 which yet he did not or one might quote the mountain which faith could shift into the sea though we have no record or report of its ever being done to say that any of these things is impossible to god would be plain folly and contradiction of the truth of his scripture and many other cases of the same kind might occur to us in reading or reflecting of which we could not deny the possibility with god although example of them be lacking 63 since however it might be said that these are works of god whereas righteous living is a matter of our own working i undertook to show that this also is a divine work and to the proof of this i have devoted the present book perhaps with more words than were needed yet as against the enemies of god’s grace i feel that i have said only too httle i am never so happy in speaking as when i have most ample support in the scripture and when the purpose is that whosoever glories may glory in the lord 1 3 and that in all things we may give thanks to the lord our god lifting up our hearts to heaven whence from the father of lights comes every best gift and every perfect gift if the fact that a thing is done by our hands or that we do it by god’s granting makes it no work of god then it is no work of god for the mountain to be carried into the sea since the lord has said that this can be done through the faith of men and set it down to their own working in the words tf ye have 11 de pecc met ii 7 12 wisdom 16.24 13 ii cor 10.17 14 james 1 17 the spirit and the letter 247 faith in you as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say to this moun tain be lifted up and cast into the sea and it shall be done and nothing shall be impossible to you christ says to you not to me or to my father yet a man could by no means do such a thing unless god granted and worked it in this way we may see that perfect righteousness may be unexampled among men and yet be not impossible it would come about if there were brought to bear the will sufficient for such an achievement and that might be if all the requirements of righteousness were known to us and if they inspired in the soul such delight as to overcome the obstacle set by any other pleasure or pain that it does not happen is due not to its impossibility but to the judg ment of god for we are well aware that the extent of a man’s knowledge is not in his own power and that it does not follow that he will pursue what he knows to be worth pursuing unless he delight in it no less than it deserves his love but that depends upon the health of the soul 64 xxxvi one might perhaps suppose that in regard to the knowledge of righteousness we have all we need inasmuch as our lord summing and shortening his word upon the earth has said that upon two commandments hang all the law and the prophets and put those commandments in the plainest words thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself that in the fulfilling of these is the com plete fulfilment of righteousness is absolute truth but to ob serve this must not be to forget how often we all go wrong in the belief that what we do is pleasing or not unpleasing to god whereas his scripture or the clear assurance of reason may after wards teach us to see that it is not pleasing to him and we have to pray in penitence for his forgiveness human life is full of such records and why is it that we know too httle of what is pleasing to him but because we know too httle of himself for we see now through a glass darkly but then face to face who could dare to think that when we come to that state of which it is written that i may know even as also i am known the love of god in those that behold him will be no greater than in the faithful here and now or indeed that there can be any com parison between the one and the other the greater the know ledge the greater the love and if that be so then whatever now we lack in love must be thought lacking to the perfection of 15 matt 17 20 and luke 17 6 conflate 15 isa 10.23 matt 22 37 ff 18 i cor 13.12 augustine later works 248 righteousness a thing can be known or believed and yet not loved but what is neither known nor believed cannot be loved through believing the saints may have been enabled to reach that love than which by the lord’s own testimony there can in this life be no greater namely to lay down their life for the faith or for the brethren but when we issue from this pilgrimage in which now we walk by faith to the sight for which still unseen we hope and in patience wait i most certainly will love itself be not only above that which we have here but far above what we ask or think yet it can never be more than love with the whole heart with the whole soul with the whole mind for there can be nothing remaining in us that could be added to the whole otherwise it would not have been the whole accordingly this first commandment of righteousness which bids us love god with our whole heart and with our whole soul and with our whole mind on which follows the other concerning love of neighbour will be fulfilled in the life to come when we shall see face to face it is commanded to us even now that we might be made aware of what faith must ask and whither hope must go ahead what are those things that are before unto which for getting the things that are behind we must reach forth 20 so as it appears to me in the righteousness that is to be made perfect much progress in this life has been made by that man who knows by his progress how far he is from the perfection of righteousness 65 we may however speak of a lesser righteousness belong ing to this life and shown in the righteous man who lives by faith though still absent from the lord and therefore walking by faith and not by sight and to this righteousness freedom from sin might not unreasonably be attributed we cannot reckon it as guilt if the love of god cannot yet reach the height appropriate to the full and perfect knowledge of heaven it is one thing to fall short of charity in its wholeness and another to follow after no evil desire so it is the duty of a man even though he loves god far less than he may love him when he is seen to abstain from all pursuit of what is unlawful just as in the sphere of sense perception the eye that cannot rest steadily upon a full blaze of light can refuse to take pleasure in darkness let us then imagine in this corruptible body a human soul wherein the most excellent perfection of charity has not yet absorbed and consumed every motive of earthly lust but which is kept by this lesser righteousness from the least leaning towards ii cor 5.7 rom 8 25 20 phil 3.13 the spirit and the letter 249 consent to such lust for the doing of any unlawful thing then we can apply to our immortal life which is to come the rule thou shalt love the lord thy god with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul and with thy whole strength and to our life here that other rule let not sin reign in your mortal body to obey its desires 21 there will be fulfilled the command thou shalt not covet here the command go not after thy concupiscences 22 there we shall have nothing more to seek but continuance in that state of perfection here a man must work to achieve his purpose and hope for its perfecting as his reward there the righteous will live endlessly in the sight for which here he longed here the righteous will live by faith longing for that hfe which will most surely be his end on these premises it will be sin for one who lives by faith to yield any consent to any unlawful delectation not only in the committing of the more abominable misdeeds or crimes but in such more venial matters as lending ear to any word that ought not to be listened to or tongue to one that ought not to be spoken or having any thought in the heart that would desire hcence for a thing known by the commandment to be unlawful and wrongly felt as delectable for that itself is consenting to sin inasmuch as it would be done but for fear of punishment but if the righteous who hve by faith resist all such temptation does that mean that they have no need to say forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors do they confute the texts of scripture in thy sight shall no man living be justified if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us for there is no man that shall not sin for there is no righteous man on earth that shall do good and not sin 23 note that both these last texts speak not of the past but of the future not has not but shall not sin these and other say ings of holy scripture in the same sense cannot be untrue it follows as i see it that in whatever kind or degree we may de fine righteousness in this life there is in this life no man entirely without sin there is need for every man to give that it may be given to him to forgive that it may be forgiven him and in respect of any righteousness he possesses not to presume that it has come of his own making but to accept it as of the grace of god who justifies yet none the less to hunger and thirst for the gift of righteousness from him who is the living bread and with whom is the well of life who so works justification in his 21 rom 6 12 22 ecclesiasticus 18 30 23 ps 143 2 i john 1.8 i kings 8.46 ecclesiastes 7 20 250 augustine later works saints that labour in the trial of this life that there is always somewhat his bounty may add in answer to their prayer or his goodness pardon upon their confession 66 let those who differ from us find a man living under the burden of our corruption whom god has no longer anything to pardon if they can do so they must either admit that he was enabled to that state not by the gift of the law's teaching but by the inpouring of the spirit of grace or else incur the guilt of no lesser sin than blasphemy itself if they accept the sacred texts just quoted in their proper sense their finding any such man is impossible nevertheless it may by no means be asserted that to god the possibihty is not present of granting to the human will aid sufficient not only for the complete perfection here and now of the righteousness which is by faith but even for that righteousness in which we shall hereafter live for ever in the contemplation of himself suppose god should will here and now to clothe in any man this corruptible with incorrup tion and to bid him live immortal among mortal men in such wise that all the old man in him were utterly done away that there were no law in his members warring against the law of his mind and that he knew the omnipresent god with that same knowledge which the saints shall have hereafter would anyone be mad enough to deny that god could do such a thing men will still question why he does not do it but the questioners be think themselves too little that they are men i know that there is neither impossibility nor unrighteousness with god i know that he resisteth the proud and giveth grace unto the humble and i know that the apostle to whom lest he be exalted was given a thorn in the flesh an angel of satan to buffet him heard once again and yet a third time the answer to his prayer my grace is sufficient for thee for strength is made perfect in weakness 24 there lies therefore a secret in the hid den depth of god’s judgments that even of the righteous shall every mouth be closed in praise of self and opened only unto the praise of god but that secret who can explore who can search out who can know so unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor or who hath first given unto him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and in him are all things to him be glory for ever and ever amen 25 24 luke 1 37 92 15 james 4.6 ii cor 12 7 ff 25 rom ii 33 ff ten homilies on the first epistle general of st john introduction t he pelagian controversy was the chief literary pre occupation of augustine from a.d 41 i his 57th year to his death in a.d 430 at the age of 75 it began as a controversy of a very different kind was ending ever since his ordination to the priesthood in a.d 391 his work had been tormented by the donatist schism and he had taken the leading part in the efforts to bring it to an end and to reunite the church in africa which culminated in the great conference of carthage in a d 41 i nominally a meeting of catholic and donatist bishops to discuss their differences but really a formal execution of the emperor’s resolve to abolish a new fangled superstition the imperial arbitrator being that same count marcellinus to whom augustine was shortly to address the spirit and the letter the schism in the african church from which christianity in africa despite the events of a.d 41 i was never to recover had lasted for a full century it had arisen as an outcome of the great persecution under diocletian in which many of the african clergy had succumbed to the order for surrender of the books of scripture even before the famous edict of milan in a.d 313 gave freedom of worship to christians rival bishops had been set up in carthage the ostensible ground of objection to the catholic bishop caecilian was that his consecration had been invalid because one of his consecrators had been a traditor a surrenderer of the scriptures in the persecution no such charge was made against caecilian himself but he was accused of un christian conduct towards imprisoned confessors and generally of discouraging the cult of martyrs which had long been a cherished element of popular christiamty in africa in a.d 313 251 augustine later works 252 the emperor constantine instructed the proconsul of africa to restore to the church the property of which it had been de prived and made it clear that he regarded caecilian as the legitimate bishop the rival party immediately appealed to him for arbitration on their case by bishops from overseas there was a series of investigations by episcopal councils at rome and at arles in gaul by the proconsul in africa and by the emperor himself at milan each time judgment went against the donatists but they were defiant and refused to surrender the churches which they held an attempt was made to enforce the imperial decision by the secular arm and the donatists counted their first martyrs from this period but constantine had other matters on hand the persecution was given up and the african church was left divided thirty years later donatus who had given his name to the schismatic party and was still its leader felt himself strong enough to ask the emperor constans for recognition as sole bishop of carthage by that time his party had acquired supporters who were to prove a doubtful advantage to them there had arisen a kind of chronic peasant revolt carried on by bands of religious fanatics known as circumcellions who combined the redress of agrarian griev ances and the cancellation of debts with the pursuit of martyr dom and terrorized the countryside under a donatist war cry in a.d 347 constans sent a commission to africa to pacify the church with offers of funds to both sides for the relief of distress but donatus rejected them as well as the imperial intervention for which he had asked with the protest which was to become notorious what has emperor to do with church and appeasement was abandoned for repression troops were called in and there was fighting and massacre donatus himself was exiled and donatism was confirmed in its representation of itself as the church of martyrs and of the catholics as bloody persecutors the accession of julian the apostate in a.d 361 with his pohcy of general toleration for all religions and sects allowed the leaders of the schism to return in full strength and this time at least the donatists were the aggressors africa was torn with communal rioting violence and bloodshed despite the recovery of imperial favour by the catholics after julian’s death donatism might well have advanced to final victory if it had not lent its support once and again in the last quarter of the century to risings against roman authority led by moorish rebels that and the increasing scandal of circumcellion out rages convinced the court that strong action was needed in homilies on i john 253 a.d 405 the existing laws against heresy were applied to the schis matics their meetings and services were prohibited and they became liable to heavy fines and economic disabilities though there was no infliction of the death penalty the desire of the catholics under augustine’s leadership to represent their vic tory as one of reason rather than of force was met by the formal hearing and dismissal of the donatist case at the conference of carthage in a.d 41 i after which donatism was finally pro scribed but though it ceased to exist as an organized church and many of its congregations returned to the catholic allegiance there was no full reunion donatism survived the vandal in vasion which was swamping roman africa when augustine died in a.d 430 and it was still strong enough to trouble pope gregory at the end of the sixth century augustine believed that the origin and stubbornness of the schism came from nothing else but the hatred of brothers that private and personal enmities had much to do with the original dispute and that the violence and cruelties which accompanied its prolongation so exacerbated the issues as to make them irreconcilable is sufficiently clear but the trouble could not have lasted so long with such persistence and bitter ness had there not been deeper causes at work the history of the schism shows at many points that social and economic factors were engaged as well as religious and ecclesiastical the lines of cleavage between donatist and catholic ran in close parallel to those which in the roman africa of the fourth cen tury divided native from immigrant punic or berber from latin speech upland village from coastal town peasant holder from wealthy land owner in short a non roman and subject from a romanized and dominant society there was no clear cut geographical division but the strength of one side lay in numidia and of the other in the old province of proconsular africa it was by no accident that seventy numidian bishops descended upon carthage m a.d 312 to consecrate a rival bishop in place of caecilian and that the great donatus who soon suc ceeded their nominee as leader of die opposition was a numi dian from the high plains numidia was always the stronghold of donatism while in the old province even in carthage itself it was never more than a minority this does not mean as has sometimes been suggested that the schism was no more than an accidental symptom of african nationalism donatism arose at the moment when the roman empire turned from being the church’s persecutor to be its augustine later works 54 patron and the church from drawing life from the blood of its martyrs to be in large measure the pensioner of the state the schism was a movement of revolt but the revolt was at bottom religious and not political in motive it is best understood as a protest against the subordination of the church to the secular power which christianity had resisted ever since its birth that the donatists were ready on occasion to appeal to the state or to take advantage of state legislation does not alter the essential character of their conflict with the established church in africa for them the perfect christian must always be the martyr apostasy the cowardly refusal to die for the faith must always be unforgivable sin the christian priest who commits that sin can be priest no longer more than that he is a plague spot that must infect all who hold communion with him touch not the unclean thing the donatists had a case though they produced no one cap able of stating it with the force needed to meet a controversialist of augustine’s calibre augustine argued first that they had failed from the beginning to establish the facts connected with caecilian’s consecration by which they justified their schism and secondly that even if the facts were established the schism could be justified only by doctrines of the nature of the church and the sacraments which were untenable and which in his view transformed it into a heresy on the question of fact it is now generally agreed that the documentary evidence bearing upon the actions of african bishops in the great persecution and the events of a.d 312 tells conclusively against the donatist claims the doctrinal issue is much more complicated it centred upon the single point of church practice which divided catholic and schismatic in the time of cyprian the african church had refused to recognize the validity of baptism conferred by any person outside catholic communion and so required the re baptism of all converts baptized in heresy or schism the church of rome had adopted the view that all baptism per formed as the church performs it is valid and this had led to a sharp controversy between africa and rome in which neither side gave way though as augustine was always reminding his donatist adversaries there was no breach of communion be tween the churches rebaptism remained the african practice until the same council of arles in a.d 314 which rejected the donatist charges against caecilian pronounced against it thereafter the catholic church in africa fell into line with rome the donatists maintained the practice of cyprian and homilies on i john 255 the doctrine which supported it namely that the holy spirit is given only in and through the holy church and that outside the church there is neither salvation nor sacrament of salvation this meant that the validity of the sacrament could not be independent of the person of the minister who must represent the church now cyprian had declared it to be the duty of catholic christians to refuse the ministrations of unworthy priests and there can be little doubt that he would have re garded apostasy in any form as a disqualification for the per formance of priestly functions the donatists were fully justified in appealing to his authority as representing the common tradi tion of the church in africa no traditor can perform a valid sacrament the point was not really met when augustine in turn appealed to cyprian’s use against his own rigorist oppo nents of the parable of the tares to show that the church in this world must tolerate the presence of sinners within her body the donatists pointed out with some justice that in the gospel interpretation of the parable the field is not the church but the world they did indeed refuse to accept the catholic argument that the holiness of the church without spot or wrinkle cannot be realized in this world but there is no evidence that their ecclesiastical discipline was more rigorous than that of the catholics and it is a mistake to attribute to them a puritan theory of the church hke that of the novatians with whom cyprian had had to deal their real concern was with the status of the minister not of the layman and even in the case of the minister they recognized the fact that not all sm is open and notorious what in their view must defile the church and render the sacrament invalid is the attempted ministration of a priest known to be guilty of mortal sin in their view the catholics of africa had abandoned the sound tradi tion of’her church as a quid pro quo for the decision in their favour by the council of arles on the question of fact it was thus augustine and not the donatist who was obliged to work out an ecclesiology to support an admitted innovation in prac tice if we cannot regard his attempt as successful that will be because he shared with his opponents the rigid dogma of cyprian that there is no salvation outside the church it fol lowed for him as for them that baptism and orders conferred outside the church must so far be ineffectual if such sacraments are not to be repeated when the recipient enters the church they must possess a validity which is unaffected by the status of the minister the recipient in heresy or schism has really been 256 augustine later works baptized or ordained because so augustine urged die real minister in every sacrament is none other than christ himself this is he which baptizeth with the holy spirif john 1 33 but if as augustine had to maintain such sacraments possess no saving efficacy unless and until the recipient becomes a mem ber of the catholic church it has to be supposed that the holy spirit whom christ gives through them remains as it were inactive so long as the recipient is outside that church’s communion this distinction between the validity and the efficacy of the sacrament has been almost exactly reversed in modern thoughi and usage catholics will now recognize that the sacraments o non episcopal bodies have at least a measure of real efficacy ir the fruits they bear though they are invalid in the sense o irregular augustine tried to make sense of his own distinctior by insisting that the holy spirit is the spirit of chanty which is the bond of perfectness col 3 14 and that the umty o the spirit can be kept only in the bond of peace eph 4 3 all schism all separation from the church violates charity anc therefore stifles the life of the spirit the great saying of paul that neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircum cision but faith working through love gal 5 6 underlies all that has permanent value in augustine’s teaching on churd and sacraments in neither one nor the other can faith be efficacious can it be christian faith at all unless it expresses itself in the energizing of charity the principle is in theoiy inexpugnable its practical application by augustine to the donatist controversy involved him in the claim that the energizing of charity was in fact manifested in the catholic church and not in the schismatic the donatists rejoined thai such a claim assorted ill with a record of persecution and wher augustine began his struggle for reunion he was insistent that the church must avoid giving any occasion for such a rejoinder he knew well the obstinacy of his opponents yet he threw all his influence into the pursuit of a policy of reconciliation by peace ful discussion of differences what made the policy so difficuli to carry out was the fact that the donatists with their circum cellion soldiers of christ were so often guilty of actions whict were criminal by the law and it was difficult to deny to the victims of such actions their proper legal redress even so augustine was able to persuade his catholic colleagues to inter cede frequently on behalf of the convicted donatist for the remission or mitigation of the legal penalty in the end like the homilies on i john 257 imperial authorities in their dealings with the christians of the second century augustine himself gave up the attempt to dis tinguish between the name of donatism and the crimes attaching to the name and accepted the proscription of donatism as such the donatists themselves had constantly used force as a method of proselytizing there seemed no answer but the legalized use of force against them if the church was to carry out her clear duty towards the many whom fear was retaining in schism against their will hence the tragic capitulation of the great preacher of chris tian charity to the principle of religious persecution compel them to come in it is upon this background that we must hear the impassioned encomia of charity in the homilies on st joms epistle hippo lay within the border of numidia and augustine’s episcopate had always been the charge of a harassed minority vacillation on the side of the state even after the decisions of a.d 41 1 had delayed the effective enforcement of those decisions and when probably towards the end of the year 414 augustine began to deliver his homilies on st john s gospel donatism was still troublesome enough in his diocese to call for constant reference and systematic refutation in his exposition of the first few chapters the fifth and sixth homilies are entirely devoted to the application against the donatists of the text john 1 32 33 and we hear that the cathedral in spite of the very cold weather was crowded to hear them at eastertide a.d 415 augustine broke off his course on the gospel to interpolate the homilies on the epistle and both the choice of theme and the treatment of it show that the schism is still in the forefront of his concern but soon after the resumption of the homilies on the gospel references in them to donatism cease almost completely it is a reasonable inference that the long drawn out struggle ended in hippo with the collapse of opposition just at this time.i charity at last had won the day but in celebrating its victory augustine could not forget that the victory had not been achieved as once he hoped it might be by the spiritual arm alone love and do what thou wilt is the most famous saying in the homilies read in its context horn vii 8 it is the preacher’s defence of compulsion in the service of love the sad monument of an uneasy conscience seeking to assure itself that the end justifies the means for the rest the homilies need no introduction they are of course sermons and not a commentary though they follow the 1 see m le landais in etudes augustinimnes pp 72 80 258 augustine later works course of the epistle verse by verse augustine’s exegesis is often unsatisfactory and his arguments on the text of scripture are often forced for example he is at pains to reconcile the apparent contradiction between i john 1 8 and 3 9 by supposing that there is om sin and one only which he who abides in christ can never commit and that is the transgression of the new commandment of brotherly love but if he is an indifferent exegete he is an incomparable preacher these homilies show him at the summit of his extraordinary power to move the soul ten homilies on the first epistle of st john the text prologue as you know my people i have been giving you a course of sermons on the gospel according to john during the present holy festival the church gives us certain fixed lessons to be read year by year which we must not alter so that there will have to be a short break in the course which we had begun and which we shall afterwards continue i have considered what part of scripture would be a fitting subject on which to speak to you as the lord may grant me ability during this joyous week and which could be completed in these seven or eight days and i have chosen the epistle of john we shall then stiu be listening to him whose gospel we have for a while put down it is a book very sweet to every healthy christian heart that savours the bread of god and it should be constantly in the mind of god’s holy church but i choose it more particularly because what it specially commends to us is charity the man who has in himself that of which he hears must rejoice at the hearing to him this reading will be like oil on the flame if there is matter in him for nounshment it will be nourished it will grow and abide for some the epistle should be like flame to firewood if it was not already burning the touch of the word may kindle it in some then what is present is to be nourished in some what may be lacking is to be kindled so that we may all rejoice together in one single charity where there is charity there is peace where there is humility there is charity and now let us hear john himself and let me speak for your better understanding whatever the lord shall put into my mind as i read the apostle’s words 259 first homily i john 1 1 2 1 1 i that which was from the beginning which we have heard and which we have seen with our eyes and our hands have handled of the word of life there could be no handling with hands of the word had not the word been made flesh and dwelt among us this word made flesh to be handled with hands took its beginning as flesh from the virgin mary but it took not then its beginning as word for we read that which was from the beginning epistle is confirmed by gospel in which you have already heard in the beginning was the word and the word was with god 1 one might understand the word of life as a speaking about christ and not the actual body of christ handled with hands but see what follows and the life itself was manifested christ then is the word of hfe how mani fested he was from the beginning but not manifested to man though manifested to the sight of angels feeding as it were upon their own bread but we read that man did eat angels food 2 the life itself has been manifested in flesh set m manifestation that what can be seen by the heart alone might be seen also by the eyes for the healing of hearts only by the heart is the word seen flesh is seen by the bodily eyes we had the means of seeing the flesh but not of seeing the word the word was made flesh which we could see that the heart by which we should see the word might be healed 2 we have seen and are witnesses seen that is as mani fested and manifested by the light of this sun the sun’s maker could only be seen by that sun’s light because he set his taber nacle in the sun going forth himself as a bridegroom out of his 1 john i i 2 ps 78 25 260 homilies on i john 26l chamber rejoicing as a giant to run his course he who was before the sun which he made before the day star and all stars before all angels the true creator for all things were made by him and without him was nothing made that he might be seen by the eyes of flesh which see the sun set his own tabernacle in the sun showed his flesh in manifestation by this light the bridegroom’s chamber was the virgin’s womb where bridegroom and bride word and flesh were joined to gether it is written and the two shall be in one flesh or as the lord says in the gospel therefore they are no longer two but one flesh so finely does isaiah make the two one when he speaks in christ’s person he put a band upon my head as on a bridegroom and adorned me as a bride with her orna ments the one speaker makes himself both bridegroom and bride for they are not two but one flesh since the word was made flesh and dwelt among us when to that flesh is joined the church there is the whole christ head and body 3 and we have seen and are witnesses and we make known to you the eternal life which was with the father and has been manifested among us that which we have seen and heard we make known to you they saw the lord himself present in the flesh and they heard the words of his mouth and made them known to us we also then have heard but we have not seen are we less happy than they who both saw and heard no for it goes on that ye also may have fellowship with us they have seen and we have not yet we are their fellows because we hold a common faith there was one of them who saw yet believed not but would feel before he believed saying unless i put my fingers into the print of the nails and touch his scars i will not believe so he who ever gives himself to be seen of angels gave himself for a time to be felt by the hands of men and that disciple felt him and exclaimed my lord and my god because he had touched a man he confessed his god and the lord for the comfort of us who cannot handle him with our hands now that he sits in heaven but can touch him by faith says to thomas because thou hast seen thou hast beheved blessed are they who see not and believe it is we who are so described and designated let us then 3 ps 19 5 4 john i 3 5 gen 2,24 matt 19 6 isa 61 lo 7 augustine’s constant doctrine that the incarnate christ and his church are a single whole s john 20 25 fi 262 augustine later works receive the blessing which the lord has promised let us hold fast that which we see not since they who saw have made it known to us that ye also may have fellowship with us you may think it no great matter to have fellowship with men but see what follows and our fellowship be with god the father and his son jesus christ these things we write to you that your joy may be full that fulness of joy is in the fellowship the charity the unity itself 4 and this is the message which we have heard from him and make known to you that god is light and there is no darkness in him the light and darkness here spoken of have nothing to do with our bodily eyes as god surpasses the creature as the maker the thing made as wisdom itself sur passes that to which wisdom has given being so that light must far transcend all others perhaps we shall come near that light if we know what it is and set ourselves before it that we may have enlightenment from it in ourselves we are darkness en kghtened by it we may become light it will not confound us because we confound ourselves to confound myself is to know myself a sinner not to be confounded by the light is to be en lightened by it the man who sees himself darkened by sin and longs to be enlightened by the hght is drawing near to it as the psalm says draw near to him and be enlightened and your faces shall not be ashamed the light will not shame you if it shows you your own ugliness and that ugliness so offends you that you perceive the beauty of the light 5 have we expounded our text too hastily we shall see as we proceed remember the words that came before that ye may have fellowship with us and our fellowship be with god the father and his son jesus christ god is light and there is no darkness in him and we should have fellowship with him the darkness must be driven from us that the light may be in us for darkness can have no fellowship with light as paul says but what follows if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we he a man may well say to himseljf what can i do how can i become light i live in sins and iniquities a gloomy despair creeps over him there is no salvation but in feuowship with god god is light and there is no darkness in him iniquities are darkness our iniquities overwhelm us so that we cannot have fellowship with god what hope is there 5 ps 34 5 10 ii cor 6.14 homilies on i john 263 am i failing to keep my promise that in these days i should have a message of joy to speak to you listen there may be a word of comfort encouragement and hope that we faint not by the way we are travellers travelling to our home land and if we despair of reaching it in our despair we faint but he whose will it is that we should reach the home land where he will keep us nourishes us upon our journey listen if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and what of our sins the blood of jesus christ his son shall cleanse us from all transgression great is the con fidence that god has given us well may we celebrate our paschal sacrifice in which the lord’s blood is shed to cleanse us from all transgression let us rest confident the devil held against us a bond of slavery but christ’s blood has wiped it out think for a moment of those brothers of ours whom we call infants but now in the name of christ whom they have confessed all their sins have been washed away by his blood they came old into the baptistery and went out new came in aged and went out infants their old life was somnolent age their new life is the infancy of regeneration but remember that past sins have been forgiven not only to them but to us after the forgiving and wiping away of all sins our life amidst the temptations of this world may not avoid all stain then let a man do what he can let him confess what he is that he may be healed by the one who never changes for he alone ever was and is we were not and we are 6 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if then you confess yourself a sinner the truth is in you for the truth itself is light your life is not yet perfect in brightness for there are sins in it yet your enlighten ment has begun with your confession of sin read on but if we confess our transgressions he is faithful and just to forgive us our transgressions and to cleanse us from all iniquity not only the transgressions that are past but any that this life brings upon us for so long as a man wears flesh he cannot be without at least the lesser sms but these that we call the lesser must not be made light of if you make light of their gravity you must tremble at their number the many lesser make a large many drops fill up a river many grains make a lump where then is our hope first of all in confession that none count himself righteous man who was not and is lifting up his head before the eyes of god who sees what he is first of all then confession 11 the baptism of catechumens took place on easter eve augustine later works 264 and next love for of charity it is said that it covers the multi tude of sins.i let us see whether charity itself is not com mended to us on account of the transgressions that steal upon us for charity alone can quench transgression pride quenches charity humility strengthens it charity quenches transgression humility is part of our confession that we are sinners but humility lies not in the spoken word which might seek only to avoid the offence of arrogance in calling ourselves righteous in wickedness and folly a man will say i know that i am right eous but i cannot say so openly for folk will not suffer it let my righteousness be known of god and i will call myself a sinner not because i am but that i may not be set down as arrogant and offensive no say what you are to man as well as to god if you do not tell god what you are he will condemn what he finds in you if you would not have his condem nation speak your own if you would have his pardon do you acknowledge your need of it say to god turn thy face from my sins say with the psalmist for i acknowledge my iniquity 13 if we confess our transgressions he is faithful and just to forgive us our transgressions and to cleanse us from all iniquity if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us if you say i have not sinned you make him a liar in seeking to maintain your own truth but how can god be a liar and man true in the face of scripture let every man be a liar and god only true 1 god in himself is true you in yourself are a liar in god you can be true 7 these words faithful and just to cleanse us from all iniquity might seem to offer impunity to sin men might say to themselves we can sin w e can do freely what we will for christ cleanses us he is faithful and just he cleanses us from all iniquity this e’s confidence must be taken from you and a wholesome fear put in its place be careful not confident he is faithful and just to forgive us our transgressions but only if you are never self satisfied if you are always being made perfect through change my little children these things i write to you that ye sin not what then will happen if human as we are some sin overtake us must we then despair if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the right eous and he is the propitiator of our sins christ is the advo cate strive yourself not to sin but if human weakness suffers 12 i pet 4 8 13 ps 51 9 3 14 rom 3 4 augustine’s version of this text vanes between propitiator and propitiatio homilies on i john 265 sin to overtake you look to it instantly let it instantly offend you instantly condemn it and having condemned it you may come in confidence before the judge for there is your advocate do not fear to lose the cause in which you confess if in the affairs of this life a man may commit himself to a clever speaker and so escape loss shall you be lost if you commit yourself to the word himself cry aloud we have an advocate with the father 8 see how john himself keeps humility a righteous man a great man who from the lord’s breast drank deep mysteries draughts of divinity from which he proclaimed in the begin ning was the word and the word was with god this john did not say ton have an advocate with the father but if any man sin we have an advocate neither you have nor you have me christ not himself and we not you rather would he set himself among sinners and have christ for his advocate than set himself as advocate in christ’s place and be found among the proud who face condemnation my brothers jesus christ the righteous is he whom we have as advocate with the father he is the propitiation of our sins the man who held fast to this caused no heresy no schism schisms arise when men say we are righteous when they say we sanctify the unclean we justify the wicked we ask we obtain but what said john if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous you will say but may not holy men ask on our behalf may not bishops and rulers ask on behalf of the people look at the scripture and you will find rulers commending themselves to the people’s prayers the apostle says to his people praying also for us the apostle prays for the people and the people for the apostle we pray for you my brothers but do you also pray for us let all the members pray for one another and let the head intercede for all no wonder then that what follows here should shut the mouths of those who divide god’s church john has said that we have jesus christ the righteous himself the propitiation of our sins but he knew that there would be some who would set themselves apart saying lo here is christ or lo there 1 7 trying to show that he who pur chased the whole and possesses the whole is only in the part 15 reference is to the donatist principle that purity of conscience in the giver of the sacrament is needed for the cleansing of the conscience of the recipient see c litt petil i jz i ff and iii 9 viii ff 15 col 4 3 17 matt 24 23 18 reference is to the donatist assertion that the catholic church through out the world has been polluted by communion with the polluted church augustine later works 266 therefore he adds at once not only of our sins but of the sins of the whole world think brethren what that means surely we are pointed to the church in all nations the church throughout the whole world be not led astray by those who pretend to justify but in fact mutilate abide in that mountain which has filled the worlds for christ is hhe pro pitiation of our sins and not of ours only but also of the whole world which he has won by his blood 9 and hereby we know him if we keep his command ments which commandments whosoever saith that he knows him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him you ask still which commandments whosoever keepeth his word truly in him is the love of god perfect maybe the commandment itself is named love we asked what commandments and we are told that whosoever keepeth his word truly in him is the love of god perfect turn to the gospel and see if this is not the commandment a new commandment give i unto you that ye love one another 20 hereby we know that we are in him if we are made perfect in him it speaks of the perfect in love what is love’s perfection to love our enemies and to love them to the end that they may be our brothers love your enemies desiring them for brothers love your enemies calling them into your fellowship for so loved he who as he hung upon the cross said father forgive them for they know not what they do 1 hereby we know that we are in him if we are made perfect in him it was of the perfection of love for enemies that the lord said be ye therefore perfect as your heavenly father is perfect 22 he therefore who says that he abides in him ought himself to walk as he walked and how is that my brethren what is walking as christ walked walking upon the sea 23 no it is walking m the way of right eousness and of that way i have already spoken nailed fast upon the cross he was walking in the way the way of charity father forgive them for they know not what they do so then when you have learnt to pray for your enemy you will walk the way of the lord in africa augxistine constantly appealed against them as here to the scriptural promises of a world wide extension of the church and he seems never to have considered the possibility that these promises may have to wait much longer for their fulfilment 19 dan 2 35 20 john 13.34 21 luke 23 34 22 matt 5 48 23 matt 14 25 ff homilies on i john 267 10 beloved i write not unto you a new commandmentj but the old commandment which ye had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which ye have heard old that is because you have heard it before but he shows it to be also new when he says again a new commandment i write unto you not another commandment but the same one that he called old is also new why is this which is true in himself and in you you have heard why it is old because you knew it already but why is it new because the darkness is passed and the true light now shineth that is what makes it new for the darkness belongs to the old man the light to the new put off the old man says paul and put on the new 4 and again ye were sometime darkness but now light in the lord 25 11 he that saith he is in the light now the whole mean ing is to be made clear he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is still in darkness ah my brothers shall i continue saying to you love your enemies are you sure that you are not still hating your brothers which is worse than failing to love enemies if you loved your brothers only you would not yet be perfect but if you hate your brothers what and where are you look each one into his own heart cherish no hate against a brother for some hard word in a quarrel for earth turn not to earth whoever hates his brother may not say that he walks in the light still less that he walks in christ he who saith he is m the hght and hateth his brother is in darkness until now such and such a man who was a pagan has turned christian think what has happened a pagan he was in darkness now he has become a christian all rejoice for him with thanks to god we repeat the apostle’s greeting ye were sometime darkness but now are light in the lord he worshipped idols but now god he worshipped the work of his own hands but now the god who made him he is changed thanks be to god all christians rejoice for him why because now he is a worshipper of father son and holy spirit and a hater of demons and idols but still john is anxious for him in the general rejoicing there is still mistrust my brothers let us take to our hearts that motherly anxiety not without reason is the mother anxious for us when others rejoice i mean the mother charity who dwelt in the heart of john when he thus spoke for there is that in us which makes him fear even when men rejoice over us and what is his fear he who saith that he 24 col 3 9 f 25eph 5.8 augustine later works 268 is in the light says that he is now a christian and hateth his brother is in darkness still there is nothing here to ex pound but only that which must sadden if it comes to pass and gladden if it be avoided 12 he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is no occasion of offence in him those who take or cause offence are those who are offended in christ and his church if you keep hold of charity you shall take offence neither in christ nor in the church and you will desert neither christ nor the church the deserter of the church cannot be in christ since he is not among christ’s members he cannot be in christ who is not in christ’s body it is they who desert either christ or the church who take offence but we can see that in him who loves his brother there is no offence for the lover of his brother endures all things for unity’s sake in the unity of charity brotherly love consists you are offended by such and such a man whether he be really evil or evil only in your belief or only in your pretence and you abandon all the many good what sort of brotherly love has been shown in our donatists because of their charge against africans they have abandoned the world 2 were there no saints in the world at large was it right for you to condemn them unheard no if you loved your brothers there would be no occasion of offence in you what does the psalm say great peace have they which love thy law and there is no offence for them 27 so they who take offence lose their peace and they who do not take or cause offence are the lovers of god’s law so that their dwelling is charity if it be said that the psalm speaks of the lovers of god’s law and not of brothers then hear the lord’s words a new commandment give i unto you that ye love one another law and commandment are one and not taking offence is but forbearing one another according to paul’s saying for bearing one another in love striving to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace 28 and that this is the law of christ is shown by the same apostle’s enjoining of that law bear ye one another’s burdens and so shall ye fulfil the law of christ 29 13 for he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walk eth in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because the darkness hath blinded his eyes there is no blindness like that of those who hate their brothers the proof is that they 26 cf above c 8 n 18 27 ps 119 165 28 eph 4 f 29 gal 6,2 homilies on i john 269 stumble on the mountain we know that the stone cut from the mountain without hands is christ who came of the kingdom of jewry without human father the stone that shattered all the kingdoms of the earthy all the tyrannies of idols and devils the stone that grew and became a great mountain and filled the whole world we do not have to point out that mountain with the finger as we sometimes point out the new moon to the short sighted this is a mountain that fills the whole face of the earth the city of which it is written a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid i and our donatists stumble on the mountain and when we tell them go up they say there is no moun tain there and will sooner strike their face against it than seek a dwelling on it yesterday we read the text of isaiah in the last days the mountain of the lord’s house shall be mani fested made ready on the summit of the mountains and all nations shall come together unto it 32 who can go astray on that mountain who can break his head by stumbling upon it who cannot recognize the city set on a hill no wonder that it is not recognized by those who hate their brothers for they walk in darkness and know not whither they go for the darkness hath blinded their eyes that is the proof of their blindness they hate their brothers because they find cause of stumbling in africa they cut themselves off from the world to brethren whom they slander they refuse toleration for the sake of the peace of christ while to others whom they condemn they grant it for the sake of the party of donatus 33 30 cf c 8 above the allusion is to dan 2.34 f 31 matt 5.14 32 isa 2 2 33 augustine frequently taxed the donatists with inconsistency in recogniz ing the sacraments of the maximianists a sect which had split off from the main body of their church second homily i john 2 12 17 i all that we read in holy scripture for our instruction and salvation demands an attentive ear you have just heard how the eyes of those two disciples upon whom the lord came in the way were held so that they did not know him he found them in despair of the redemption that was m christ supposing him now to have suffered and died as a man not imagining him to live for ever as the son of god and then he opened unto them the scripture and showed them that it behoved the christ to suffer and all things to be fulfilled that were written concerning him in the law of moses and the prophets and the psalms so embracing the whole of the old testament everything in those scriptures speaks of chnst but only to him that has ears he opened their mind to understand the scriptures and so let us pray that he will open our own 2 what was it then which the lord showed as written con cerning himself in law prophets and psalms the evangelist has set it down in few words that we might know what in all that extent of scripture we should believe and understand there is many a page many a book but the content of all is in these few words of the lord to his disciples that it behoved the chnst to suffer and to rise again on the third day 2 so much we learn of the bridegroom and what of the bride wherefore must christ suffer and rise again because all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord and all the kin dreds of the nations shall worship before him so here our minds are led on from bridegroom to bride and that in his 1 in one of the special lessons for eastertide to which augustine refers in the prologue luke 24 13 ff 2 luke 24 46 3 ps 22 27 270 homilies on i john 27i name repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached through all nations beginning from jerusalem brethren you hear mark it well let none doubt that the church is of all nations let none doubt that it began from jerusalem and filled all nations 3 when we tell the donatists that if they are catholic christians they must be in communion with that church from which the gospel has been spread throughout the world they answer we have no communion with the city where our king was slain our lord was slain but he loved that city and had compassion on it therefore he said that the preaching of him self should begin from jerusalem you shrink in horror from the communion of that city which he made the starting point for the preaching of his name no wonder the severed branch may hate the root but he told his disciples tarry ye in the city because i send my promise upon you he willed that his dis ciples should tarry there and that there he should send them the holy spirit the church began in that place where the holy spirit came from heaven and filled a hundred and twenty persons as they sat together the number of the apostles was multiplied tenfold there sat in that place a hundred and twenty persons and the holy spirit came and filled all the place there was a sound as of a rushing mighty wind and cloven tongues as of fire you have heard to day the lesson from the acts they began to speak with tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and all that were there jews coming from divers nations heard each one his own tongue and marvelled how these unlearned and ignorant men should suddenly have learnt not one or two strange tongues but the tongues of all peoples that speaking in the beginning in all languages was a sign that men of every language should believe but our donatists whose love for christ is such that they refuse com munion with the city that killed him give to christ the strange honour of confinement to two languages the latin and the punic or african christ is to possess two tongues only for these two alone no more are spoken by the followers of donatus brethren let us keep our minds awake let us see rather the gift of god’s spirit let us believe what was foretold concerning him and let us see the fulfilment of the psalmist’s prophecy there is neither speech nor language whose voices shall not be heard s that this means not the assembling of tongues in 4 luke 24 47 5 luke 24 49 acts 2 4 7 cf horn i 8 12 ps 19 3 ff 272 augustine later works one place but the coming of the gift of christ to all tongues is clear from what follows their sound is gone out into all the earth and their words unto the end of the world and this because he hath set his tabernacle in the sun that is where all may see it his tabernacle is his flesh his tabernacle is his church set in the sun in the day not in the night why then do they not acknowledge it turn again to where we ended yesterday’s reading and you will see the reason he that hateth his brother walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because the darkness hath blinded his eyes let us then read on and not be in darkness we shall not be in dark ness if we love the brethren and the proof of love for the brotherhood lies in not rending our unity in maintaining charity 4 i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you through his name little children because new born by the forgiveness of sins but whose is the name through which sins are forgiven certainly not the name of augustine and therefore not the name of donatus either but no need to mention augustine or donatus it is not even the name of paul or the name of peter when the corinthians were dividing their church and setting up parties instead of unity mother charity travailing with her children in person of the apostle opens her bosom and speaks as if tearing her breast she weeps for the sons whom she sees borne out to burial she recalls to the one name those who would enrol themselves under many she sends them back from the love of herself to the single love of christ was paul crucified for you or were ye baptized in the name of paul in other words if you would be with me you must not be mine be with me and all of us are christ’s who died for us was crucified for us and so in our text your sins are forgiven you through his name not through the name of any man 5 i write unto you fathers why do children come first because your sins are forgiven you through his name and you are born again into a new life which makes you children and why fathers because ye have known him who is from the beginning and there is a beginning in all fatherhood christ is new in the flesh ancient in divinity be fore abraham i am and not before abraham only heaven and earth were made before there was any man before them the lord was or rather is most truly does he say not before i cor 1 13 10 john 8 58 homilies on i john 273 abraham i was but before abraham i am that of which we say that it was is not and that of which we say that it will be is not yet he knows only being begotten of the eternal father begotten from eternity in eternity with no beginning no end no local extension because he is that which is because he is he who is that is the name he told to moses thou shalt say unto them he who is hath sent me unto you therefore to say before abraham before noah before adam is not enough hear the scripture before the morning star i have begotten thee 12 and the last word must be before heaven and earth for all things were made through him and without him nothing was made 3 thus you may know who are fathers for they become fathers by knowing that which is from the beginning 6 i write unto unto you young men there are children fathers and young men children because they are born fathers because they know the beginning and why young men because ye have overcome the evil one to children belongs birth to fathers age to young men strength if the evil one is overcome by young men he stiu fights with us fights but vanquishes not is that because we are strong or because he who was found weak in the hands of persecutors is strong in us he who resisted not his persecutors has made us strong for he was crucified in weakness but lives in the power of god.i4 7 i write unto you children children because ye have known the father i write unto you fathers and here he repeats because ye have known him who is from the begin ning remember that you are fathers if you forget him who is from the beginning you have lost your fatherhood i write unto you young men once more bear in mind your youth fight that you may overcome overcome that you may be crowned be humble lest you fall in the battle i write unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of god abideth in you and ye have overcome the evil one 8 brethren all that is said here that we have known that which is from the beginning that we are strong that we have known the father all this seems to commend icnowledge does it not also commend charity if we have known let us love for knowledge without charity cannot save knowledge puffeth n ex 3 14 13 john 1 3 a.l.w 18 12 ps 110 3 lxx and vulg 14 ii cor 13 4 augustine later works 274 up but charity edifieth if you would confess but not love you make yourselves like the demons they confessed the son of god they said what have we to do with thee and they were driven back do you confess and embrace they feared for their iniquities do you love the forgiver of your iniquities but we cannot love god if we love the world if we love the world it will separate us from the love of god which is charity the apostle makes us ready then to have charity dwelling in us two loves there are of the world and of god if the love of the world dwells in us the love of god can find no entrance the love of the world must depart the love of god come in to dwell make room for the better love once you loved the world now cease to love it empty your heart of earthly love and you shall drink of the love divine charity will begin its dwelling in you and from charity nothing evil can proceed hear then the words of the apostle who now would cleanse you he sees men’s hearts as a field and in what condition if he finds weeds he roots them up if he finds clean land he plants that tree which he would fain plant which is charity the weeds that he would root up are love of the world hear the rooter up of weeds love not the world nor the things that are in the world if a man love the world the love of the father is not in him 9 you hear this brethren let none say in his heart that this is not true it is god’s word spoken by the holy spirit through his apostle and nothing can be truer if a man love the world the love of the father is not in him would you have the love of the father and be fellow heir with the son love not the world shut out the evil love of the world that you may be filled with the love of god you are a vessel that was already full you must pour away what you have that you may take in what you have not we know that these our brethren have been born again of water and the spirit even as we were so many years ago it is good for us not to love the world lest there remain in us only sacraments for our condemnation and not stays for our salvation the stay of salvation is to have charity at the root to have the virtue of godliness and not the form only the form is good and holy but it avails nothing apart from the root the severed branch is cast into the fire you should keep the form but in union with the root and there is no way to be firmly rooted but by holding fast to charity according to the words of the apostle paul rooted and grounded in charity is 13 i cor 8 1 i s matt 8 29 17 cf horn i 5 is eph 3 17 homilies on i john 275 10 because all that is in the world is the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the pretensions of this life three things which are not of the father but of the world and the world passeth away and the desires thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever as he abideth for ever why may i not love what god has made make your choice either to love things temporal and pass away with time’s passing or not to love the world and to live for ever with god the river of time sweeps us on but there like a tree growing by the nver is our lord jesus christ he took flesh died rose again as cended into heaven he willed to plant himself as it were beside the river of things temporal if you are drifting down to the rapids lay hold of the tree if you are caught up in the world’s love lay hold of christ he for your sake entered into time that you might win eternity for by his entering into time he did not cease himself to be eternal 11 let us not love the world nor the things that are in the world for the things that are in the world are the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the pretensions of this life the naming of these three forestalls objection a man might say the things that are in the world are what god has made heaven and earth sea sun moon stars and au the furnishings of the heavens why should i not love what god has made let god’s spirit indeed be in you to show you that all these things are good but beware of loving things created and forsaking their creator you find them fair but how much fairer is he that formed them think my friends you may learn by a parable lest satan get advantage of you saying as he is wont be happy in god’s creation he made it only for your happiness so men’s wits are stolen and they perish in forget fulness of their maker they use the creature with lust instead of temperance and the creator is despised of such the apostle says they worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed for ever i 9 god forbids you not to love them but he will not have you seek your bhss in them the end of your esteem for them should be the love of their maker sup pose my brethren a man should make for his betrothed a ring and she should prefer the ring given her to the betrothed who made it for her would not her heart be convicted of mfidehty in respect of the very gift of her betrothed though what she loved were what he gave certainly let her love his gift but if she should say the ring is enough i do not want to see his 19 rom 1 25 276 augustine later works face again what should we say of her should we not all abhor such fevolity and charge her with the mind of an adulteress gold is more to you than a husband a ring more than your betrothed if it is in you to transfer your love from your be trothed to the ring and not to want the sight of him he will have given you a pledge not for security but for divorce yet surely the pledge is given by the betrothed just that in his pledge he himself may be loved even so god has given you all these things therefore love him who made them there is more that he would give you even himself their maker though god has made these things if you love them and are careless of their creator if you love the world must not your love be set down for adulterous 12 world is the name not only for this fabric that god has made of heaven earth and sea of things visible and invisible we use the word world also for the dwellers in it just as we do the word house both for the structure and its occupants sometimes we approve the house while we condemn the occu pants now just as men may dwell in heaven by lifting up their hearts though in the flesh they walk on earth so all lovers of the world are dwelling in the world by their love and thus may themselves be called the world and in them there is nothing but these three the desire of the flesh the desire of the eyes and the pretensions of this life they desire the pleasures of food drink and sex but in such things there is a due limit when you are told not to love them it does not mean that you are for bidden to eat or drink or beget children but for the creator’s sake there is a limit set so that the love of all this does not make prisoner of you lest your love of what you should possess for use become the love of final enjoyment the test comes only when the choice between this and that is set before you money or the right i am without the wherewithal to live the wherewithal to eat and drink but what if you can only gain that wrongfully were it not better to set your love on what you cannot lose than to commit a wrong you have eyes for the gain of money not for the loss of faith here then he tells us is the desire of the flesh the desire that is of what belongs to the flesh food and sex and so forth 13 and the desire of the eyes by this he means all that itch for marvels which i call curiosity it has a very wide scope 20 for the distinction of use and enjoyment cf de tnn x 13 17 and for detailed discussion de dtv qjmest lxxxiii 30 and de docir christ i 4 homilies on i john 277 the public spectacle the theatre the devil’s mysteries the arts of magic and sorcery all pander to curiosity but sometimes it may try the servants of god making them wish to be wonder workers to try whether god will hear them by a miracle that is curiosity the desire of the eyes it is not of the father if god has given you such power use it he has offered it for your use but the lack of it will prevent no one from belonging to the kingdom of god when the apostles rejoiced because the devils were subject to them what said the lord to them rejoice not in this but rejoice because your names are written in heaven 2 1 he would have his apostles rejoice for the same cause as you too have for rejoicing it will go hard with you if your name is not written in heaven but will it go hard if you have not raised the dead if you have not walked upon the sea if you have not cast out devils if you have received the power to do such things use it in humility and not in pride for the lord has said even of certain false prophets that they should do signs and wonders therefore shun the pretensions of this life the pretensions of this life are pride men desire to vaunt themselves upon their honourable positions they think themselves great because of their wealth or powerful standing 14 apart from these three things you will find nothing that tempts human covetousness nothing but desire of the flesh or desire of the eyes or pretensions of this life by these three was the lord tempted of the devil 22 he was tempted by desire of the flesh when it was said to him if thou art the son of god command these stones that they become bread when he was hungry from fasting remember how he repulsed the tempter and taught his soldiers to fight saying man liveth not by bread alone but by every word of god he was tempted again by desire of the eyes for a miracle when the devil said cast thyself down for it is written he hath charged his angels to bear thee up that thou strike not thy foot against a stone so did he resist the tempter for if he had worked a miracle he must have appeared either to have yielded or to have done it for curiosity’s sake he did indeed work miracles when he would as god but for the sake of healing the sick if at that time he had done so it would have seemed as though his only purpose was to work a miracle but to avoid such misapprehension observe how he answered and if ever such temptation comes to you do you answer as he did get thee behind me satan for it is written thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god meaning 21 luke 10 20 22 matt 4 i ff 278 augustine later works if i do this i shall be tempting god our lord spoke as he would have you speak if die enemy should whisper to you a poor sort of man a poor sort of christian must you be have you worked a single miracle have the dead arisen at your prayer have you healed the fever stricken were there really anything in you you would do some mighty work answer him and say it is written thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god i will not tempt god as though i should belong to him if i wrought a miracle but not otherwise how then should he have said rejoice that your names are written in heaven and lastly our lord was tempted with the pretensions of this hfe when the devil raised him up on the height and said to him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me he would have tempted the king of ages with the exaltation of an earthly kingdom but the lord that made heaven and earth trod the tempter under foot no wonder in deed that the lord should vanquish the devil but his answer to the devil was to teach you your own it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve hold to the lord’s answers and you will be free from all lusting after the world in that freedom you will be enslaved neither by desire of the flesh nor by desire of the eyes nor by the pretensions of this life and you will make room for the coming of charity which is the love of god if your heart is occupied by love of the world the love of god will not be in it hold to the love of god that you may stand fast for ever as god stands for the being of every man is according to his love dost thou love the earth to earth thou shalt turn dost thou love god i would not dare to say a god thou shalt be yet we have the word of scripture i have said ye are gods and ye are all the sons of the most high 23 if then you would be gods and sons of the most high love not the world nor the things that are in the world if any man loveth the world the love of the father which is charity is not in him for all that is in the world is the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the pretensions of this life which are not of the father but of the world that is of men who love the world and the world passeth away and the desires thereof but whosoever doeth the will of god abideth for ever even as god abideth for ever 23 ps 82 6 augustine is chary in use of the characteristically greek idea of the divmization of the christian by grace third homily i john 2 18 27 i children it is the last hour in this text he addresses us as children that we may hasten to grow because it is the last hour bodily age is not a matter of will no one grows in the flesh when he wills as no one is bom when he wills but where birth lies in the will so does growth no man is born of water and the spirit save willingly therefore if he wills he grows if he wills he diminishes to grow is to go forward to diminish is to go back the man that knows he has been born must leam that he is a child an infant he must set his hps eagerly to his mother’s breast and he will grow quickly now the mother is the church and her breasts are the two testaments of holy scripture from them let him suck the milk of all the mysteries enacted in time for our eternal salvation that he may come nourished and strengthened to eat that food of which the gospel tells in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god our milk is christ in his humility our food is the same chnst m his equahty with the father 1 3 but lest we be slow to go forward let us pay heed children it is the last hour go forward run and grow it is the last hour the last hour is long but it is the last it means the last time for in the last times shall come our lord jesus christ but some would say it cannot be the last time the last hour surely antichrist must come first and then the day of judgment such thoughts were known to john and to rouse men from the security of imagining that this is not the last hour 1 cf de tnn bk xiii in which knowledge of the historic incarnation is set forth as the necessary preparation for the wisdom which is contemplation of the eternal word 279 28 o augustine later works because antichrist is yet to come he tells them as ye have heard that antichrist cometh even now have there been many antichrists in what hour but the last could there be many antichrists 4 he goes on to explain of whom he is speaking wherefore we know that it is the last hour we know because there are many antichrists they went out from us now we recog nize them they went out from us so that we must lament our loss yet there is comfort but they were not of us all heretics all schismatics have gone out from us that is from the church but they would not go out if they were of us therefore before their going out they were not of us and if that be so there may be many within who have not gone out and yet are antichrists we make bold to say this only to the end that none who is within becomes an antichrist john is about to describe and designate the antichrist we shall soon see who they are and every one must question his own conscience whether he be such antichrist means one contrary to christ and what that means you are to learn from the apostle’s account of it and understand that none can go out but antichrists whereas those that are not contrary to christ can by no means do so for he that is not contrary to christ is set firm in his body and reckoned a member and members are never contrary to one another the wholeness of the body is constituted by all the members together and for the concord of the members we have paul’s word that if one member suffer all the mem bers suffer with it and if one member is glorified all the members rejoice with it if that be true the concord of the members must exclude the antichrist 5 they went out from us but grieve not for they were not of us and the proof is that if they had been of us they would have remained with us so my friends you are to see that many who are not of us may receive with us the sacraments may receive with us baptism and all that the faithful know them selves to receive blessing and eucharist and all the sacred mysteries may receive with us the very communion of the altar and yet they are not of us that they are not of us is proved in the hour of trial when trial comes to them hke a gust of wind they are scattered abroad for they were not grain but chaff they will all be scattered as we must never forget on that day of judgment when threshing begins in the lord’s floor beloved you may be very sure of this that any who have gone 2 i cor 12.26 homilies on i john l28l out and afterwards return are not antichrists not contrary to christ it is impossible for those who are not antichrists to remain without but it is of his own will that every man is either in christ or against him they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would have remained with us but that it should be made manifest that not au were of us that it should be made manifest because while yet within they are not of us but this is not manifest till it is shown by their going out and ye have an anointing from the holy one that ye may be manifest to yourselves this spiritual anointing is the holy spirit himself of whom the visible anointing is the sacrament john tells us that all who have this anointing of christ’s can recognize evil and good they have no need to be taught for their anointing teaches them of itself 6 i write unto you not that ye have not known the truth but because ye know it and because no lie is of the truth here we are given warning how to recognize the antichrist christ is the truth he said i am the truth but no he is of the truth therefore none that lie are yet of christ it is not said that some lie is of the truth and some he not of the truth take heed of the words as they stand and shun all flattery of yourselves all de ceiving of yourselves jvb lie is of the truth but let us see the manner of antichrist’s lying for there is more than one kind of lie who is the liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ 7 ask the heretics and you will find none that denies that jesus is the christ my friends there is a mystery here give heed to what the lord god shall put into our mind and what i would make you understand here are men who have gone out from us and become donatists we ask them whether jesus is the christ and they straightway confess that he is if then he is anti christ who denies that jesus is the christ neither can they give the name to us nor we to them for both we and they confess the same but if neither may call the other antichrist then neither have they gone out from us nor we from them but if there has been no going out from us we are in unity and then whence come the two altars in this city whence come divided houses and homes the sharing of the marriage bed and the division of christ our text gives us warning and requires us to confess the truth either they have gone out from us or we from them but the latter is unthinkable we have the testament of the lord’s 3 john 14 6 282 augustine later works inheritance we read the psalm and find it said i will give the nations for thine inheritance and the ends of the earth for thy possession 4 we hold christ’s inheritance they do not for they will not have communion with the world with the universal company of them that are redeemed by the lord’s blood we stand secure in the unity of the inheritance and whoever re fuses communion therewith has gone out from it 8 if then they have gone out from us they are antichrists and if antichrists then hars and if liars then guilty of denial that jesus is the christ we come back to our problem ask each one singly and they will confess that jesus is the christ let us then enquire who it is that denies and let us consider not words but deeds let the tongue keep silence awhile and put your question to the hfe if we can find assurance from scripture that actions may deny as well as tongues we can indeed point to many antichrists who profess christ with their mouth and de part from him in their ways and we have that assurance from the apostle paul speaking of such men he says they profess to know god but m works they deny him 5 there you have the antichrist every one that denies christ by his works there is no liar like the antichrist who professes with his mouth that jesus is the christ and denies it by his actions he is a liar because he says one thing and does another 9 but it follows from this my brethren that if deeds are what we must question we shall find not only many anti christs who have gone out from us but many still concealed who have not gone out at all if there are within the church perjurers defrauders workers in magic dabblers in divination adulterers drunkards usurers slave dealers and such whom we cannot enumerate all these things are contrary to the teaching of christ and the word of god for the word of god is christ and all that is contrary to god’s word is in anti christ that is contrary to christ the openness of their resis tance to christ can easily be shown for some evil action that they do they incur rebuke and not daring to slander christ they slander his ministers from whom the rebuke comes if you show them that you are speaking christ’s words and not your own they do their best to convict you of using words that are your own and not christ’s but if it be too plain that your words are christ’s words they will even set upon christ and begin to find fault with him how they say and why has he made us 4 ps 28 for the argument cf horn i 8 13 5 tit 1 16 homilies on i john 283 such as we are is not that the daily excuse of men convicted of their own ill doing perverted by crookedness of will they accuse the craftsman and the heavenly craftsman our maker and our re maker cries aloud to them but what was it that i made in you a man not avarice a man not robbery a man not adultery do you put right what you have made that the making of god in you may be preserved if you will not if you love and cling to your sins you are contrary to christ whether within or without you are antichrist whether within or with out you are chaff and not grain not without only because you have not yet faced the wind 10 brethren the point is clear let no man say i worship not christ but god his father every one that denieth the son hath neither the son nor the father and he that confesseth the son hath both the son and the father he speaks to you that are good grain but let them that were chaff give heed and be changed into grain let each one consult his own conscience and if he is a lover of the world let him change let him become christ’s lover not christ’s enemy tell a man that he is anti christ and he gets angry and thinks an outrage done him maybe he threatens a libel action if his adversary calls him by that name christ says to him be patient if the charge is false you may rejoice with me for i too am falsely charged by anti christs but if it is true summon your conscience and if you fear the name fear yet more the deserving of it 11 let that therefore abide in you which yourselves have heard from the beginning if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall abide in you ye also shall abide in the father and the son this is the promise that he hath promised us perhaps you would ask of the reward and say suppose i guard in myself obediently what i have heard from the begin ning for the sake of that abiding i endure perils toils and trials what is my profit my reward in this life i see that i must labour under trials what then will god give me hereafter here i see there can be no rest mortality weighs upon the soul and the corruptible body presses me downwards but i bear it all that what i have heard from the beginning may abide in me and that i may say to my god because of the words of thy hps i have kept to hard ways but for what reward hear and faint not or if you were fainting under your labours let the promised reward make you strong no worker in the vineyard will dismiss from his mind what he is to receive if he 6 wisdom 9.15 7 ps 17,4 284 augustine later works should forget his reward his hands will fail him the recollec tion of the promised reward gives perseverance in the work even when the promiser is a man that can deceive in the field of god how much greater should be your strength when the promise has come from the truth that can neither die nor give place to another nor deceive him who has had its promise what then is the promise let us look to that is it gold so much loved by men in this world or silver is it possessions for which men pour out the gold they love so much pleasant estates large houses numerous servants herds of cattle that is not the kind of reward which he encourages us to expect that we may hold fast in our labour the reward is named what eternal life you hear and you cry out with joy set your love then on that which you have heard and look for enfranchise ment from your labours into the repose of eternal life eternal fife that is what god proimses and what he threatens is eternal fire to those set on his right hand he says come ye blessed of my father receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world and to those on his left depart into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels if you can not yet desire the one at least fear the other 12 remember then my brethren that eternal life is christ’s promise this is the promise which he hath promised to us even eternal life these things have i written to you con cerning them that lead you astray let none lead you astray unto death set your heart upon the promise of eternal life whatever the world may promise it promises to one who may die to morrow and then how will you face him that abideth for ever you say i am driven to do wrong by the threatenings of powerful persons what do such threats amount to prison fetters brandings the rack the beasts yes but not eternal fire tremble at the threatenings of the almighty and desire the promises of the almighty then the whole world’s terrors will be of as little account as its promises these things have i written to you concerning them that lead you astray that ye may know that ye have an anointing and that the anointing which we have received from him may abide in you the anointing has its outward sign or sacra ment the power of it is invisible the unseen anointing is the holy spirit the unseen anointing is the charity which is the living root of everyone in whom it is found the root that cannot the congregation has applauded cf horn vii 10 9 matt 25.34,41 homilies on 1 john 385 wither let the sun be never so hot for every plant that is well rooted is nourished and not withered by the sun’s heat 13 and ye have no need that any man should teach you because his anointing teacheth you concerning all things what then are we about my brethren in offering you teaching if his anointing teaches you all things our labour is to no purpose we may spare our breath and leave you to his anointing that it self may teach you yet this question that i have just asked myself may be asked even of the apostle let john deign to hear it put to him by a lesser man who asks had they to whom thou didst speak an anointing surely for thou didst say his anointing teacheth you concerning all things why then write such an epistle what teaching what instruction what edification wast thou giving by it you see here my brethren a great mystery the sound of our words strikes the ear but the master is within 10 you must not think that anyone learns from a man the noise of our voice can be no more than a prompting if there be no teacher within that noise of ours is useless brethren do you need that i should explain further have you not au heard this sermon yet how many will leave this place untaught for my part i have spoken to all but those who hear not the inward speech of that same anointing those whom the holy spirit teaches not inwardly go home untaught outward teachings are but a kind of helps and promptings the teacher of hearts has his chair in heaven therefore he says himself in the gospel call no man your master upon earth for one is your master even christ let him then speak to you within when no man is there indeed there may be no man in your heart though a man be at your side but it is not well that there be none in your heart let chnst be in your heart let his anointing be there lest your heart be left alone to thirst with no water spring to refresh it he that teaches is the inward master christ and his inspira tion where that inspiration and that anointing are lacking the noise of words from without is vain brethren these words that we speak to you from without are like the husbandman to the tree his is an outward working he gives water and careful til lage but whatever his outward application it is not he that forms the fruit that clothes the bare branches with the shade of leaves that acts inwardly in any such manner who it is you may learn from the apostolic husbandman and see what we are and listen 1 augustine always teaches that we can recognize truth only through the presence within us of the magtster interior who is christ u matt 23 8 f a86 augustine later works to the inward master i planted apollos watered but god gave the increase for neither he that planteth is anything nor he that watereth but god who giveth the increase 12 xhis then is our word to you whether we plant or water through our speaking we are nothing ah is of him who gives his increase even god that is his anointing that teacheth you concerning all things i cor 3 6 f fourth homily i john 2 27 3 8 i our reading of yesterday my brethren ended as you will remember with the words ye have no need that any man should teach you the anointing itself teacheth you concerning all things 2 it goes on and it is true this same anointing that is the spirit of the lord the teacher of men cannot lie it is no liar even as it hath taught you so abide in it and now httle children abide in him that when he shall be manifested we may have confidence in his sight that we may not be put to shame by him at his coming you see my brethren we believe in jesus whom we have not seen and we await his coming all who await him in faith will rejoice when he comes those that are without faith will be ashamed when what they see not now has come and their confounding will not be for a moment and then pass as is the way with men who are confounded when de tected in some fault and meet the tauntings of other men this confounding will set the confounded upon the left hand where they will hear their sentence depart ye into eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels let us then abide in his words that we be not put to shame when he comes 3 if ye know that he is righteous know also that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him perfect righteousness is not yet in any but the angels in us it has only its beginning by faith after the spirit you heard in the reading of the psalm jbegin unto the lord with confession 2 begin and the beginning of our righteousness is the confession of sins if you 1 matt 25 41 2 ps 147.7 the latin versions of the psalms regularly use confiteri and confessto for thanksgiving augustine’s own confessions were meant to be thankgivings as much as confessions of his sins 287 augustine later works 288 have begun to make no defence of your sin you have already taken the first step in righteousness it will be made perfect in you when the doing of nothing else shall delight you when death shall be swallowed up in victory then when no evil desire shall stir within you when there shall be no striving with flesh and blood when shall come the crown of victory the triumph over the adversary then shall righteousness be per fect here as yet we are engaged in fight as fighters we stand in the arena strokes are given and received the issue of the battle is awaited but victory goes to him who thinks not to deal his strokes in his own arm’s strength but by the encouragement of god in the fight against us the devil stands alone if we stand with god we overcome the devil for to fight alone against the devil is to court defeat he is a practised enemy that has won many a trophy and so hear what follows in our epistle it tells us to overcome the devil but not of ourselves tf ye know that he is righteous know also that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him born of god born of christ these words is born of him are for our encourage ment because we are born of him our perfecting is already sure 4 behold what manner of love the father hath given unto us that we should be called and be the sons of god to be called and not to be to have the name and not the reality avails no one there are many called physicians who cannot cure there are many called watchers that sleep all night so are there many called christians that are not found such in fact because what they are called they are not in life in manners in faith in hope in charity but what is it brethren that these words tell you behold what manner of love thetather hath given unto us that we should be called and be the sons of god for this cause the world knoweth us not because it hath not known him so the world knoweth not us there is a whole world of christians and a whole world of ungodly for ungodly and godly are both spread through all the world and we can see that the first know not the second because they revile men of good life consider whether there be not such among your selves any one of you that lives a godly life thinks little of worldly matters wiu not frequent the public shows will not make festivals an excuse for drinking or what is worse seek the protection of holy days for uncleanness is not one that 3 augustine had hard work to purge the observance of christian holy days from the customs associated with pagan religious festivals see his ep xxix to alypius and cf serm 31 1 352 homilies on i john 289 abstains from such things reviled by them that do them and would he be so reviled if he were recognized he is not recog nized because the world does not recognize him by the world as i have often said and need not weary you by repeating is meant the dwellers in the world as we use the word house for its inhabitants so when you find world used in a bad sense you are to understand only the world’s lovers those who dwell in the world by their love of it and earn their name from that in which they dwell for this cause the world knoweth us not because it knew not him the lord jesus christ himself walked on earth god was in flesh his strength hidden in weak ness and why was he not known because he convicted men of all their sins they could not recognize god because they de lighted in the pleasures of sin the desires kindled by their fever made them do violence to the physician 5 what then of ourselves here already we are born of him but because our hfe is in hope there is more to be said beloved now are we the sons of god now and what then do we wait for if we are already sons of god and it is not yet manifest what we shall be what shall we be more than sons of god listen we know that when he shall have appeared we shall be hke him for we shall see him as he is set your minds upon this it is a great matter ponder that word is do you know its meaning that which is said to be and not only said to be but truly is is changeless it abides for ever it knows no change no element of decay it neither advances for it is perfect nor goes back for it is eternal and what is it in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god what is that word he who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god 5 the christ who is thus in the form of god the word of god one with the father equal to the father evil men cannot see the word as made flesh the wicked also will be able to see for he will come to judge even as he came to be judged they will see the form of the servant not the form of god be cause they are godless and the lord himself says blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god brethren what we are to see is a vision that neither eye hath seen nor ear hath heard nor hath come up into the heart of man a vision sur passing all earthly beauties of gold or silver of woods or fields 4 john 1 1 matt 5 8 5 phil 2 6 7 i cor 2 9 ago augustine later works the beauty of sea and sky of sun moon and stars the beauty of angek eyrelling all these things for all have their beauty from him 6 and when we see this what shall we be what is the promise given us we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is the spoken word has done all it could the rest must be pondered in the heart in comparison of him who is what could john say and what can be said by us whose desert is so far below his we must go back to the anointing of which he has spoken that anointing which teaches inwardly what passes utterance and since as yet you cannot see your work must lie in longing the whole life of the good christian is a holy longing what you long for as yet you do not see but longing makes in you the room that shall be filled when that which you are to see shall come when you would fill a purse knowing how large a pre sent it is to hold you stretch wide its cloth or leather knowing how much you are to put in it and seeing that the purse is small you extend it to make more room so by withholding the vision god extends the longing through longing he makes the soul extend by extending it he makes room in it so brethren let us long because we are to be filled see how paul stretches out his purse so that it may have room for that which is to come not that i have already received he says or already am made perfect brethren i count not myself to have appre hended we ask what then is your business in this life if you have not yet apprehended he answers one thing forgetting the things that are behind and stretching out to the things that are before according to my purpose i follow aifter the prize of the upward calling he speaks of himself as stretching out and following according to his purpose he felt himself too small to take in that which eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor hath come up into the heart of man that is our life to be trained by longing and our training through the holy longing advances in the measure that our longings are severed from the love of this world i said once before empty out that vessel that is to be filled you are to be filled with good pour away the evil god would fin you shall we say with honey where can you put it if you are fue of vinegar wliat your vessel held must be poured away and the vessel cleansed cleansed were it with toil and chafing so that it be fit to hold did we say honey gold wine speak as we may of that which cannot be spoken call it what 8 phil 3 i3f homilies on i john 201 we will its proper name is god even in this word god what have we said is that single syllable the whole of that for which we wait nothing that we have power to name is high enough let us stretch ourselves out towards him that when he comes he may fill us full for we shall be like ium because we shall see him as he is 7 and every one that hath this hope in him he sets us you see in hope notice the agreement of paul with his fellow apostle by hope are we saved but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man sees why should he hope for if we hope for that which we see not we wait for it in patience patience itself trains up the longing wait for he waits walk on steadfastly that you may reach the end he will not leave that place towards which you are moving listen again and every one that hath this hope in him punfieth himself even as he is pure notice that these words purifieth himself preserve our freedom of choice none but god can purify us but god purifies you not against your will you purify yourself in uniting your will to god you purify yourself not by yourself but by him who comes to dwell within you yet because there is here an act of your own will to you too there is something assigned and it is assigned to you that you may say with the psalmist be thou my helper forsake me not ii thus to ask for help means that you do something for if you do nothing how can he help you 8 every one that committeth sin committeth wickedness you cannot distinguish sin and wickedness you caimot say i am a sinful man but i am not wicked for sin is wickedness how then shall we deal with our sins and wickednesses let us hear what john says and ye know that he hath been mani fested to take away sin and in him is no sin he in whom there is no sin has come to take away sin were there sin in him it must needs have been taken away from him not by him every one that abideth in him sinneth not that is in so far as a man abides in him he does not sin everyone that sinneth hath not seen him nor known him that seems very difficult yet it is not strange we have not seen him but we are one day to see him we have not known him but one day we shall we rom 8 24 f 10 one of the few echoes in the homilies of the pelagian controversy in his preaching augustine always insists on the part of the will in right action and the reality of free choice 11 ps 27 9 augustine later works 292 believe in him whom we have not known may we say that we have known him by faith but not as yet by sight surely in faith we have both seen and known for if faith does not yet see why are the faithful called the enlightened there is one en lightenment of faith another of sight in our present pilgrimage we walk by faith not by sight 1 3 so that our righteousness ako is by faith and not by sight when the time of sight has come our righteousness wiu be perfect meantime we may not let go of the righteousness which is of faith for the just lives by faith as the apostle says.i everyone that abideth in him sinneth not for every one that sinneth hath not seen him nor known him the man that sins does not believe if he believe he does not sin so far as he belongs to the faith of christ 9 little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he christ is righteous we must not suppose because it is said that we are righteous even as he that we are on an equality with god you must take the sense of this word as a httle back we read purifieth him self even as he is pure but none would dare to say that our purity is equal to the purity of god or our righteousness to his even as does not always imply equality consider for ex ample the difference between a man’s face and its image in a mirror there is a face in the image and a face in the body but the image exists as a likeness the body as a reality yet we say that there are eyes and ears here even as there there is disparity in the object but what even as implies is likeness so there is an image of god even in ourselves but not that image which is in the son as the father’s equal yet if we according to our capacity were not even as he there would be no ground for calling us like him thus he purifies us even as he is pure but his purity is of eternity ours of faith we are righteous even as he is righteous but he is righteous in changeless everlastingness we by believing in him whom we see not in order that at last we may see even when our righteousness has been perfected when we have been made equal to the angels it will still not be the equal of his righteousness how far then must it fall short of him now if not even then will it be equal 10 he that doeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning is of the devil means as you know that he imitates the devil the devil has made no one begotten or 12 enlightenment was a term very early in use for christian baptism 13 ii cor 5 7 14 rom 1.17 homilies on i john 293 created none but anyone who imitates the devil as though bom of him becomes the devil’s son by imitation though not by a true birth you are a son of abraham but abraham did not beget you the jews that were sons of abraham became sons of the devil 15 because they imitated not the faith of abraham though they were born of his flesh so if those that had their birth of him were disinherited because they failed to imitate him you though not so born are made his son and his son you shall be by imitation in the same way if you imitate the devil in his pride and impiety against god you will be his son by imitation not by creation or begetting 11 unto this end the son of god was manifested ah my brethren all sinners are bom of the devil inasmuch as they are sinners adam was made by god but when he consented to the devil he was bom of the devil and all that he has begotten are as he was with concupiscence itself we were born and our birth comes of that condemnation before we add to it debts of our own if we are bom with no sin there is no reason for hastening with our infant children to baptism for their absolution there are two births for your understanding my brothers of adam and of christ two men but of them one man is man the other man is god through the man that is man we are sinners through the man that is god we are justified one birth has cast us down to death the other has raised us up to life one draws sin along with it the other delivers from sin for to this end came christ as man that he might do away with the sins of man to this end the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil 12 for the rest my beloved i must not overburden you to day there is a question hard for us to answer that arises from our speaking of ourselves as sinners if a man says that he is without sin he is a liar you will remember the earlier words of this very epistle of john if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us yet m this later chapter you are told that whosoever is born of god sinneth not he that doeth sin hath not seen him nor known him everyone that doeth sin is of the devil sin is not of god once again we are put in fear how can we be bom of god and confess ourselves sinners to say that we are not bom of god would be to take all meaning from the sacraments applied to 15 john 8 44 16 stock defence of the doctrine of original sin 294 augustine later works infants yet john has said that whosoever is bom of god sin neth not and the same john again has told us that if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us it is a serious and difficult question and i would have your minds set upon finding its answer to morrow in the lord’s name we will discourse of it as he shall enable us fifth homily i john 3 9 18 i i ask to day for your closest attention since we have no light matter for our considering indeed the interest with which you listened to yesterday’s sermon assures me that it will be even keener to day for the question to be raised is a very difficult one we are asking what is meant by this text in our epistle he that is born of god sinneth not in view of that earlier saying in the same epistle tf we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us 2 now give your minds to these words i want you to face the difficulty so that your earnest attention may be a prayer on my behalf as well as yours and god may grant us enlargement and open the way out that none may find occasion of falling away in his word the word that is neither preached nor written but for healing and salvation every one that is born of god committeth no sin because his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god this is put very strongly but maybe the words sin neth not refer not to any sin but to some particular sin then by the saying he that is born of god sinneth not we may understand some special kind of sin which a man that is born of god cannot commit a sin of such a kind that its commission binds all other sms upon us whereas if it be not committed the others may be absolved what is that sin transgression of the commandment and what commandment a new command ment give i unto you that ye love one another 1 consider this commandment of christ has the name of love and through that love are sins absolved if it be not kept not only is the sin grave but it is the root of all sins 1 john 13 34 295 augustine later works 296 3 consider this my brethren the suggestion we have made is one that may give the key to our problem when rightly under stood there is a sin that cannot be committed by him who is born of god if that sin be not committed others are absolved if it be committed others are bound fast and this sin is the transgression of christ’s command the new covenant a new commandment give i unto you that ye love one another the man that acts contrary to charity contrary to brotherly love may not dare to boast that he is born of god but for him who is established in brotherly love there are certain sins that he can not commit above all the hating of a brother and as for au other sins of which it is said that if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us for them he may take confidence from another text of scripture charity covereth the multitude of sins 4 charity then is the theme of our exhortation as it is the theme of this epistle the lord after his resurrection put no other question to peter but lovest thou me once was not enough a second time he asked the same a third time the same and though at the third questioning peter was distressed as though the lord did not believe him as one ignorant of what was passing in his heart yet the question was asked once twice and thrice fear had three times denied love three times con fessed peter loves his lord and what shall he offer him his own trouble had found utterance in those words of the psalm what shall i return unto the lord for all that he hath returned to me 4 for the psalmist’s mind was set upon the great things that god had done for him he sought for what he might do in return and could not find it for there is nothing that one would return which one has not received from him for the return of it and so we see that what he found to return was what he had received from god i will receive the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the lord none had given him that saving cup but he to whom he would make the return but to receive the saving cup and to call upon the name of the lord is to be filled full with charity so full that not only will you not hate your brother but you will be ready to die for him that is the perfection of charity to be ready to die for your brother and this our lord displayed in himself by dying for all and praying for those by whom he was crucified with the words father forgive them for they know not what they do but if he were 2 i peter 4 8 3 john 21 15 ff 4 ps 1 16 12 f 5 luke 23 34 homilies on i john 297 the only one so to act he had been no teacher as having no dis ciples disciples there were who followed him and did the same as stephen was stoned he fell upon his knee and prayed lord lay not this sin to their charge he showed his love for his murderers in that he died for them so we find paul saying i would myself be spent in behalf of your souls 7 for among those souls were some for whom stephen prayed when he was dying at their hands that is the perfection of charity charity is perfect in him whom it makes ready to die for his brethren but it is never per fect as soon as it is born it is born that it may be perfected born it is nourished nourished it is strengthened strengthened it is made perfect and when it has reached perfection how does it speak to me to live is christ and to die is gain my desire was to be set free and to be with christ for that is by far the best but to abide in the flesh is needful for your sake he was willing to live for their sakes for whom he was ready to die 5 to teach us that this is the perfect charity which he that is born of god cannot violate or sin against the lord says to peter peter lovest thou me and peter answers i love thee what return could peter make to him that loved him this feed my sheep that is do for thy brethren what i have done for thee i have redeemed all by my blood do not shrink from dying for the confession of the truth that others may follow your example 6 but this my brothers as i have said is perfect charity possessed by him that is born of god think my dear people and understand what i am saying the person that is baptized has received the sacrament of birth he possesses the sacrament a sacrament great divine holy unspeakable consider its purport to make a new man through die remission of all his sins yet he must look well into his heart and see whether that which has been done in his body is made perfect there let him see whether he has charity and then say i am born of god if he has not charity the master’s mark is on him but he is a deserter straying from the ranks let him have charity or else let him not say that he is born of god he may say but i have the mystery of the sacrament the apostle will answer him if i know all mysteries and have all faith so as to remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing acts 7 60 ii cor 12 15 8 phil 1 21 ff cor 13.2 augustine later works 298 7 you will remember that when we were beginning the reading of this epistle i asked you to bear in mind that charity is what above all else it enjoins upon us the writer may appear to pass from one subject to another but to this always he re turns he means all that he says to be brought into relation with charity so let us see whether he does so here listen every man that is bom of god doth not commit sin if we take this to mean any sin it will conflict with that other saying tf we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us and so we ask what sin and look for some pointing from the writer himself lest i may have been over hasty in sug gesting that this sin is the violation of charity because of his say ing above he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walk eth in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because the darkness hath blinded his eyes but perhaps in the words which follow here we shall find express mention of charity you will see that indeed the turning of the sentence leads us to that very conclusion every one that is born of god sinneth not because his seed abideth in him the seed of god is god’s word as the apostle puts it i have begotten you through the gospel 10 and he cannot sin because he is born of god we look now to be told wherein he cannot sin in this are mani fested the children of god and the children of the devil every one that is not righteous is not of god and he that loveth not his brother he that loveth not his brother the reference of these last words is clear love is the only final distinction between the sons of god and the sons of the devil all may sign themselves with the sign of christ’s cross all may answer amen and sing alleluia all may be baptized all may come to church and line the walls of our places of meeting but there is nothing to distinguish the sons of god from the sons of the devil save charity they that have charity are born of god they that have not charity are not there is the great token the great dividing mark have what else you will if this one thing you have not all is to no purpose if you lack all the rest have this and you have ful filled the law for he that loveth another says the apostle hath fulfilled the law and charity is the fulness of the law this i would say is the pearl which the merchantman in the gospel went seeking who found one pearl and sold all that he had and bought it 12 charity is that precious pearl without 10 i cor 4 15 11 rom 13 8 10 12 matt 13 46 homilies on i john 209 which all that you have profits you nothing and which suffices you if you have nothing else now your vision is by faith then it will be by sight and if we love while we do not see with what ardour shall we embrace when we have seen but how are our hearts to be trained through love of the brethren you may say i have never seen god you cannot say i have never seen a man love your brother in loving the brother whom you see you will see god at the same time for you will see charity itself and there within is gk d dwelling 8 he that is not righteous is not of god and he that loveth not his brother for this is the message note how proof is given this is the message that we have heard from the begin ning that we should love one another the writer points clearly to his authority whoever transgresses that command ment is involved in that abominable sin into which they must fall who are not born of god not as cain who was of the evil one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his works were evil and his brother’s righteous thus where envy is there cannot be brotherly love consider this my people envy and love exclude one another in the envious is the devil’s sin for it was by envy that the devil cast man down he fell and envied him that stood upright he sought to cast down not that he himself might stand but that he might not be alone in his fall keep in your minds what the apostle’s com ment teaches that in charity there can be no envying you have the express saying in the praise of charity charity envieth not 13 there was no charity in cain and had there not been charity in abel god would not have accepted his sacrifice when both brought their offering the one from the fruits of the earth and the other from the young of sheep it is not to be thought that god cared not for the fruits of the earth and loved the lambs god looked not at that which was in their hands but saw what was in their heart and seeing the one offer in charity had respect unto his sacrifice seeing the other offer in envy from his sacrifiice turned away his eyes the good works of abel mean nothing but charity the evil works of cain mean nothing but hatred of a brother more than hating his brother he envied his good works and because he would not follow his example he resolved to slay him herein he showed himself a son of the devil as abel showed himself a righteous man of god herein therefore my brethren is the proving of men we are to observe not what men say but their deeds and 13 i cor 13.4 300 augustine later works their heart a man that will not do his brethren good shows what he has in him by temptation men are tested 9 marvel not my brethren if the world hateth us i should not need to keep teuing you what the world means it is not heaven or earth or the works of god’s making but the lovers of the world i know that some of you must find such repetition tedious but it is not for nothing if some cannot tell when they are asked whether the preacher said it so let me try by hammering it in to leave something sticking in my hearers minds li the world in its good sense is heaven and earth and god’s works in them as when it is said the world was made by him again the world may mean the fulness of the earth as in john’s own words he is the propitiator not only of our sins but of the sins of the whole world here world means all the faithful scattered in all parts of the earth but in its bad sense the world is the world’s lovers and those who love the world cannot love their brother 10 if the world hateth us we know and what is it that we know that we have passed from death unto life and how do we know that because we love the brethren let there be no questioning of another let each man turn to his own heart and if there he finds charity towards his brothers let him be sure that he has passed from death unto life his place already is on the right hand he need not be concerned that his glory is at present hidden when the lord comes then he will appear in glory he has the vigour of life though it is still winter his root is vigorous though the branches be dry there is life in the pith the leaves and fruit are ready there within waiting for the summer therefore we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren he that loveth not re maineth in death and lest you suppose it a light thing my brothers to hate or not to love hear the warning that follows every one that hateth his brother is a murderer if there were any that made light of hatred for brothers can he in his heart make light of murder he may not lift his hand to kill yet al ready he is counted by the lord a murderer the brother may live but he is already judged as the shedder of blood every one that hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him 11 hereby we know love he speaks now of love’s perfec tion that perfection on which we have dwelt hereby we know i a pleasant example of the preacher’s knowledge of his congregation john i 10 1 1 john a 2 homilies on 1 john 3oi love in that he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren here is the beanng of the lord’s words peter lovest thou me feed my sheep peter’s feeding of his sheep was to mean the laying down of his life for them as we may learn from the saymg that followed when thou wast young thou girdedst thyself and went whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wilt not and this he said adds the evangelist signifying by what death he should glorify god teaching the man he had charged to feed his sheep to lay down his life for the sheep 12 brethren how does charity begin wait a moment you have heard how it is made perfect the end of it and the form of it has been enjoined by the lord in the gospel greater charity hath no mail than this that he lay down ws life for his friends thus is the perfection of charity shown in the gospel and thus commended here but you will be asking among yourselves when shall we be able to possess such charity do not too soon despair of yourself perhaps it is already bom but not yet grown to perfection cherish it so that it be not stifled you may say but how am i to know we have been told how it is perfected but we would hear how it begins this is what john goes on to say he that hath this world’s goods and seeth his brother an hungered and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how shall the love of god be able to dwell in lum there is where charity begins if you are not yet capable of dying for your brother show now your capacity to give him of your goods let charity even now be stirring your inmost heart to do it not for display but out of the very marrow of compassion thinking only of the man and his need if you cannot give of your super fluity to your brother are you going to be able to lay down your life for him in your purse lies money of which thieves may rob you and if they do not still you must part from it when you die though it part not from you while you live what are you going to do with it your brother is hungry in want maybe he is in trouble hard pressed by some creditor he has not what he needs you have he is your brother he and you were purchased together one price was paid for both of you both were re deemed by the blood of christ is there pity m you for him if you have this world’s goods do you ask what concern is it of mine am i to give my money to save him from inconvenience if that is the answer your heart gives you the love of the father 17 john 15 13 302 augustine later works dwells not in you and if the love of the father dwells not in you you are not born of god how can you boast of being a chris tian you have the name and not the deeds if the work goes with the name call you pagan who will you prove yourself christian by your deeds for if your deeds prove not your christianity then though all may call you christian the name without the reality can avail you nothing he that hath this world’s goods and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how can the love of god dwell in him and then it goes on xittle children let us not love in word only and in tongue but in work and in truth sixth homily i john 3 19 4 3 i you remember my brothers that we ended our sermon of yesterday with that sentence which as it was the last you heard should certainly have stayed and still remain in your mind little children let us not love in word only and in tongue but in work and in truth 2 we ask what is this work and this truth can there be a work more apparent than giving to the poor yet many do it for display and not for love can there be a greater work than dying for the brethren yet even of this many seek only the reputation ambitious of acquiring the name and not in truly heartfelt love the true lover of his brother is he who before god assures his own heart wherein god alone sees who puts to his heart the question whether what he does is indeed for love of the brethren and has witness borne him by that eye that pene trates the heart which no man can observe so the apostle paul ready as he was to die for his brethren saying i will myself be spent for your souls 1 yet because that motion of his heart was visible to god only and not to the man to whom he spoke he tells them to me indeed it is a very small thing to be judged of you or by any day of man and in another place the same paul shows that such things may be done for empty display not in the solid strength of charity in his commending of charity itself he says if i give all my goods to the poor or give my body to burn and have not charity it profiteth me nothing 3 can anyone so act without charity it is indeed pos sible look among those who for lack of charity have brought division upon our unity you will see many who give much to the poor you will see others so ready to face death that when 1 ii cor 12 15 2 i cor 4 3 see r.v mg 3 l cor 13.3 303 augustine later works 304 the persecutor stays his hand they hurl themselves to destruc tion such men certainly do this without charity back then to the voice of conscience of which the apostle says tor this is our glory the testimony of our conscience back to the voice of conscience of which the apostle says again let each man prove his own work and then shall he have glorying in himself and not in another let each one of us prove his own work whether it issues from the pulse of charity whether the branches of good works spring forth from the root of love let each man prove his own work says paul and then shall he have glorying in himself and not in another when witness is borne him not by another’s tongue but by his own conscience 3 this then is what our epistle here teaches us hereby we know that we are of the truth when we love in work and in truth not in words and tongue only and assure our heart before him before him that is where god sees him so says the lord himself in the gospel take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men to be seen of them else ye shall have no reward with your father who is in heaven what else is the meaning of the saying let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth but that the right hand is a pure con science and the left the desire of the world from desire of the world many perform many a wonder but it is the work of the left hand not the right the right hand must do the work and without the left hand knowing it lest worldly desire intrude itself when we do a thing in the love of what is good and how can we be sure of this you stand before god ask your own heart look at what you have done and what was your purpose in it your own salvation or the empty praise of man look within for a man cannot judge one whom he cannot see if we assure our heart let us do so in god’s presence for if our heart feel evil that is charges us inwardly of not acting with the right intention god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things you may hide your heart from man hide it from god if you can how shall you hide it from him to whom a sinner of old time spoke in trembhng confession whither shall i go from thy spirit and whither shall i flee from thy pre sence he sought a place of escape from god’s judgment and found none for where is god not if i climb up into heaven 4 so the circumcellions were reported to do m their fanatical zeal for martyrdom 5 ii cor 1 12 7 matt 6.1 3 6 gal 6 4 8 ps 139.7 f homilies on i john 3o5 thou art there if i go down into hell thou art with me whither are you to go whither can you flee if you will hear counsel flee to god himself if you would flee from him flee to him by confessing not by hiding for hide you cannot but con fess you can say unto him thou art my refuge and let the love which alone opens the way to life be nourished in you let witness be borne you by your conscience for it is of god and if it is of god desire not to display it before men for neither can their praises exalt you to heaven nor their censures pull you down from thence let his eyes be on you who gives the crown let him be the witness by whose judgment you receive it god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things 4 beloved if our heart feel no evil we have confidence unto god feel no evil that is tells us truly that we love and that the love in us is true love sincere not feigned seeking our brother’s good looking for no profit from our brother but his own well being we have confidence unto god and what soever we ask we shall receive from him because we keep his commandments our confidence then is not in the sight of men but where god himself sees in the heart and we shall receive from him whatsoever we ask only because we keep his commandments what are his commandments need we al ways be repeating it a new commandment give i unto you that ye love one another lo the duty of which our text speaks is charity charity is what it enjoins whoever has charity for the brethren and has it before god in the place where god sees and whoever’s heart when honestly examined gives to his questioning no answer but that it holds the true root of charity whence good fruits proceed he has confidence with god and whatever he asks he shall receive from him because he keeps his commandments 5 but there is a difficulty here of you or me or of any man of our time who may ask something of the lord our god and not receive it it is easy to say he has not charity one man may think as he will of another but a more serious question arises when we consider those men whom all acknowledge to have written as saints and now to be with god 6 you and i are nothing but the church of god known to all if god will we belong to his church and if we abide in her by love we must so persevere if we would show the love we have but how are we to think evil of the apostle paul did he not love his brethren did he not have the witness of his conscience in the 9 ps 32.7 10 john 13 34 3o6 augustine later works sight of god was there not in paul that root of charity whence all good fruits proceeded it would be madness to deny it yet we find him asking and not receiving lest i be exalted by the greatness of the revelations there was given unto me a pricking of my flesh a messenger of satan to buffet me concerning which i besought the lord three times that he would take it away from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for strength is made perfect in weakness you see his prayer that the messenger of satan might be taken away from him was not heard but why because it was not for his good thus he was heard unto his own good though not heard accord ing to his desire this is a great mystery which i would have you my people understand and always remember in your temptations the prayers of the saints are heard unto their good in all things always heard unto their eternal good and that is what they desire to that end they are always heard 8 so we should understand that though god gives not what we wish he gives what is for our good when you are ill you may ask for something that is bad for you which the physician knows to be so suppose you ask for cold water if it is good for you the doctor will give it at once if it is not he will refuse it but that does not mean that he does not hearken in denying you your wish he has hearkened to you for your health so let charity brethren be in you let charity be in you and you need have no care even when your request is not granted you are heard though you know it not many are left to themselves to their hurt of whom the apostle says god gave them over to the desires of their heart 12 a man that has asked for great wealth may have received it to his own hurt while he was without it he had little to fear as soon as he has possession of it he has become a prey to the stronger his wish to own what brings the robber’s hand upon him when in his poverty none attacked him has indeed been granted to his hurt learn so to make your requests to god as trusting the physician to do what he knows best confess your sickness and let him apply the remedy only hold fast yourself to charity let him use knife or cautery as he wills if under the cutting the burning and the pain your cry is not heard he knows how far the gangrene goes you want him to withdraw his hand while he searches the wound he knows how deep he must press to reach the end he does not hear you as you would but as your cure demands be 11 ii cor ia 7 ff 12 rom i 24 homilies on i john 307 sure then my brethren that the apostle’s words are true for we know not what to pray for as we ought but the spirit him self maketh intercession for us with groamngs that cannot be uttered because it is he that intercedeth for the saints the spirit that intercedes is nothing but the same charity which the spint has wrought in you as the same apostle says the charity of god is shed abroad in our hearts through the holy spirit that is ven to us charity itself groans in prayer and he who gave it cannot shut his ears to its voice cast away care let charity make request and the ears of god are ready to listen the answer comes not what you want but what is to your advantage therefore whatsoever we shall ask we shall receive from him here as i have said there is no ifficulty if we understand that the receiving is for our good otherwise the difl culty is so great as to lead you into calumny of the apostle paul whatsoever we shall ask we shall receive from him because we keep his commandments and do what is pleasing to him in his sight in his sight that is in the inward place where he sees us 9 and what are these commandments this is his com mandment that we should believe the name of his son jesus christ and love one another you see what the commandment is and you see that its transgressor commits the sin from which every man that is bom of god must be free as he gave us commandment namely to love one another and he that keepeth his commandment remember that it enjoins upon us nothing but love of one another he that keepeth his com mandment shall abide in him and he in him and hereby we know that he abideth in us from the spint which he hath given us is it not plain that the holy spirit’s work in man is to cause love and chanty to be in him is it not plain that in the words of the apostle paul the charity of god is shed abroad in our hearts through the holy spirit that is given to us john was speaking of charity and saying that we ought to question our own heart in the sight of god but if our heart feel no evil that means if the heart confess that any good work is wholly performed from love of brother and if that were not enough he adds when speaking of the commandment this is his com mandment that we should believe the name of his son jesus christ and love one another and he that doeth his command ment abideth in him and he in him hereby we know that he abideth in us from the spirit which he hath given us if you 13 rom 8 26 f 1 rom 5.5 3o8 augustine later works find charity in yourself you have the spirit of god to give you understanding and that is a thing most necessary 10 at the church’s beginning the holy spirit fell upon the believers and they spoke with tongues unlearnt as the spirit gave them utterance it was a sign fitted to the time all the world’s tongues were a fitting sigmfication of the holy spirit because the gospel of god was to have its course through every tongue in all parts of the earth the sign was given and then passed away we no longer expect that those upon whom the hand is laid that they may receive the holy spirit will speak with tongues when we laid our hand upon these infants the church’s new born members none of you i think looked to see if they would speak with tongues or seeing that they did not had the perversity to argue that they had not received the holy spirit for if they had received they would have spoken with tongues as happened at the first if dien the holy spirit’s presence is no longer testified by such marvels on what is anyone to ground assurance that he has received the holy spirit let him enquire of his own heart if he loves his brother the spirit of god abides in him let him see himself examine himself before the eye of god let him see if there is in him the love of peace and unity love of the church that is spread throughout all the world let him look for love not only of the brother pre sent at his door we have many brothers whom we do not see yet are we linked to them in the unity of the spirit that not all are here with us is natural but all of us are in one body and have one head in heaven my brothers our eyes cannot see themselves they are as it were unknown to themselves but we cannot say that they know not themselves in the charity of a single bodily organism that they know themselves in charity’s union is plain from the fact that when both are open the right eye cannot mark anything unmarked by the left you cannot turn one upon its object without the other they go together and turn together they have one direction though their positions are separate if then all who love god with you share with you a single direction do not think of your bodily separation from them in space together you have set your heart’s eye upon the light of truth and so if you would know that you have received the spirit ask your own heart it may be that the sacrament is yours without the virtue of the sacrament ask your heart and 5 cf horn i 5 in schism the sacrament must be without its virtue within the church it may be cf introduction p 256 homilies on i john 3o9 if the love of brother is there your mind may be at rest there can be no love without the spirit of god paul cries aloud the charity of god is shed abroad in our hearts through the holy spirit which is given to us ii beloved believe not every spirit this is because he had said hereby we know that he abideth in us from the spirit which he hath given to us now you are to observe how the spirit himself is recognized beloved believe not every spirit but test the spirits if they be of god and who is to be the tester of the spirits the task set before us is a hard one my brethren and it were good for us to be taught by the apostle how we are to discern the truth he will teach us no fear but first observe with attention and see how the chicaneries of idle heretics have their source here exposed observe beloved believe not every spirit but test the spirits if they be of god the holy spirit is described in the gospel under the symbol of water when the lord cried saying if any man thirst let him come to me and drink he that believeth on me from his belly shall flow rivers of living water and the evangelist expounds the meaning of the saying in the next verse this he spake of the spirit which they that should believe on him were to re ceive there were not many baptized by our lord it says the spirit was not yet given because jesus was not yet glori fied some were already baptized but they had not yet received the holy spirit whom the lord sent from heaven on the day of pentecost for the giving of the spirit the lord’s glorifying was waited for yet before he was glorified and sent the spirit he was calling men to prepare themselves to receive that water of which he said let him that thirsts come unto me and drink and he that believeth on me from his belly shall flow rivers of living water what are nvers of living water what is this water no need to ask me the gospel tells you this he spake of the spirit which they that should beheve on him were to receive there is a difference then between the water of the sacrament and the water that signifies the spirit of god the water of the sacrament is visible the water of the spirit is invisible the former washes the body and signifies what happens in the soul by the spirit the soul itself is cleansed and nourished this is the spirit of god that cannot be pos sessed by heretics or any that sever themselves from the church moreover all they who are so severed not by their own express act but by reason of their wickedness and thus become john 7.37 ff 310 augustine later works chaff tossed about within the threshing floor and not grain all these possess not the spirit that spirit signified by our lord with the name of water 12 it still remains for us to discover how the presence of god’s spirit is to be tested we are given an indication though not perhaps a simple one but let us see we shall be brought back to charity the charity which instructs us because it is our anointing but what is said here test the spirits if they be of god for many false prophets have gone out into the world there we are pointed to all that is heresy or schism and the means of testing is now to be given hereby is known the spirit of god open your heart’s ear we have been asking in our perplexity who can know or discern now we are to receive a sign hereby is known the spirit of god every spirit that con fesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is antichrist of whom ye have heard that he is to come and now is he in the world we are listen ing eagerly for the discernment of spirits and what we have heard seems to give us no help in discerning them what are we told every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god but then the spirit that is in heretics will be of god for many of them confess that jesus christ is come in the flesh 13 ah my brethren but we must pay heed to men’s actions and not to the noise of their words let us ask why christ came in the flesh then we may find who are they that deny his coming so if you pay heed to words you will hear many a heresy con fessing that christ has come in the flesh but truth convicts them why did christ come in the flesh was he not god is it not written of him in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god was he not then as he is now the food of angels did he not come to this world without leaving heaven and again ascend without leav ing us alone why then did he come in the flesh because it needed that we should be shown the hope of resurrection he was god and he came in the flesh death was not possible for god for the flesh it was and he came in the flesh in order that he might die for us and how came he to die for us greater charity hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends 18 charity therefore it was that brought him to death and it follows that whoever has not charity denies christ’s coming in the flesh 17 john i i 18 john 15 13 homilies on i john 3ii now put the question to every heretic did christ come in the flesh he did so i believe and confess nay but you deny it how so you hear me assert it nay i convict you of your denial you assert it with the voice and deny it with the heart you assert it in words but deny it in deed in what way do i deny it in deed because christ came in the flesh m order that he should die for us and he died for us because he taught the height of charity greater charity hath no man than this that he lay down his life for his friends you have not charity because you break up unity to do yourself honour hence then you may know the spirit that is of god tap with your finger on the vessel of earthenware and see whether the sound it gives be cracked or false see if it sounds true and whole see if charity is there you are removing yourself from the world’s unity you are dividing the church by schisms you are rending the body of christ he came in the flesh to gather men together you cry aloud to scatter them abroad therefore the spirit of god is he that maintains christ’s coming in the flesh not in word but in deed not by loud noises but by love he is not the spirit of god who denies jesus christ’s coming in the flesh whose denial also is not by his tongue but by his hfe not in words but in deeds so it is clear how we are to iriow the brethren many are within the church that are within in seem ing only but none are without that are not without in reality 20 19 but of course augustine is thinking of donatists 10 augustine would however have added that some of those who are without are nevertheless predestinate members of the church seventh homily i john 4 4 12 2 now ye are children of god and ye have overcome him overcome that is the antichrist for he had said above every one that dissolveth jesus christ and denies that he is come in the flesh is not of god we have explained as you remember that all who violate charity deny jesus christ’s com ing in the flesh because there was no cause but charity for the coming of jesus it is that same charity here enjoined upon us which he himself enjoins in the gospel greater love can no man have than this that a man lay down his life for his friends 1 by no means could the son of god lay down his life for us but by clothing himself with the flesh in which he might die there fore whoever violates charity let his tongue say what it will by his life denies christ’s coming in the flesh and that man is antichrist wherever he is and into whatever place he has made his way and to them who are citizens of the home land after which we sigh john says ye have overcome him how because greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world he would not have them ascribe the victory to their own strength and so be overcome by the presumption of pride for the devil overcomes every man that he makes proud so with intent that they may keep humble john says first ye have overcome him that word overcome might make any man raise his head hold himself upright and look for praise but be not uplifted see whose is the victory in you you have overcome because greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world be humble carry your master go quietly under your rider it is good for you that he have the reins and use them if you have not him on your back you may throw up your head 1 john 15 13 312 homilies on i john 313 and heels but riderless it will go ill with you that freedom will despatch you to the wild beasts as their prey 3 they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them they who speak of the world you must observe are they who speak against charity you have heard the lord’s saying if ye forgive men their sms your heavenly father also will forgive you your sins but if ye for give not neither will your father forgive you your sins there is the sentence of truth deny it if it be not the truth who speaks if you are a christian and believe the christ he said i am the truth that sentence is true and fast now hear the men that speak of the world are you not to have your revenge is he to tell the tale of what he has done to you no let him feel that he is dealing with a man we hear that sort of thing every day from those who speak of the world and the world hears them such things are said only by those who love the world and only by those who love the world are they listened to you have been told that he who loves the world and is regard less of charity denies the coming of jesus in the flesh what if the lord himself had so acted in the flesh if when struck by men’s hands he had been moved to avenge himself if hanging on the cross he had not said father forgive them for they know not what they do if he who had the power would use no threatenings why should you that are subject to another’s power go puffing and blowing he died because he willed to die and threatened not are you to threaten who know not when your death shall be 4 we are of god let us see why that is so whether there is any reason but charity we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth us not hereby know we the spirit of truth and of error because he that hears us has the spirit of truth and he that hears us not has the spirit of error now let us see how he counsels us and let us hear his counsel as given in the spirit of truth counsel given not to anti christs not to lovers of the world not to the world if we are born of god beloved he goes on and remember what he has said we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth us not hereby is known the spirit of truth and of error our attention is roused he that loiows god hearkens he that knows not hearkens not and 2 matt 6 14 f 3 john 14 6 4 augustine has the homely expression quid sufflas augustine later works 314 here lies the discerning of the spirit of truth and of error let us see what is to be the counsel wherein we should hear him beloved let us love one another why because this is a man’s counsel because love is of god it is a strong commendation of love to say that it is of god but there is more to come and let us listen with all our ears love he has said is of god and everyone that loveth is bom of god and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not god why for god is love my brothers what more could be said if nothing else were said in praise of love in au the pages of this epistle nothing else whatever in any other page of scripture and this were the one and only thing we heard from the voice of god’s spirit for god is love we should ask for nothing more 5 see now that to act contrary to love is to act contrary to god let no man say when i do not love my brother i sin against a man note this well sin against a man is a small thing it is only against god i may not sin how can you not be sinning against god when you sin against love god is love the words are not mine if it were i that said god is love any of you might take offence and say what was that what did he mean god is love god has given love god has granted love love is of god god is love there my brethren is god’s scripture before you this is a canonical epistle read in every nation maintained by universal authority on which the world itself has been built up here you are told by the spirit of god god is love now if you dare act against god and refuse to love your brother 6 but how do these two texts stand to one another first love is of god and now god is love god is father and son and holy spirit the son is god of god the holy spirit is god of god and these three are one god not three gods if the son is god and the holy spirit is god and he in whom the holy spirit dwells is a lover then god is love but god because of god in the epistle you have both love is of god and god is love of the father alone scripture never says that he is of god so when we read the words of god we must understand them either of the son or of the holy spirit and from the saying of the apostle the charity of god is spread abroad in our hearts through the holy spirit that is given to us 5 we may understand that in love is the holy spirit it is the holy spirit himself whom evil men cannot receive who is that fountain of which scripture says let thy fountain of 5 rom 5 5 6 the same exegesis is developed in de tnn xv 31 homilies on i john 315 water be thine own and let no stranger share with thee for all who love not god are strangers antichrists though they enter our churches they cannot be counted among the sons of god that fountain of life belongs not to them the evil man as well as the good can possess baptism the evil man as well as the good can possess the gift of prophecy king saul possessed it he persecuted the saintly david and was filled by the spirit of prophecy and began to prophesy the evil man as well as the good can receive the sacrament of the body and blood of the lord for of such it is written he that cateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to himself the evil man as well as the good can have the name of christ can be called a christian of such it is written they defiled the name of their god all these sacraments may be possessed by the evil man but to have chanty and be an evil man is not pos sible this therefore is the peculiar gift of the spirit he is the one and only fountain to drink of it cjod’s spirit calls you god’s spirit calls you to drink of himself 7 hereby is manifested the love of god in us see now we have our calling to love god could we love him did he not first love us if we were slow to love let us not be slow to the return of love he first loved us not as we love ourselves he loved wicked men but did away their wickedness he loved wicked men but not for wickedness did he bring them together into one he loved sick men but visited them for their cure then god is love hereby is manifested the love of god in us in that he sent his only begotten son into this world that we might live through him even as the lord himself says greater love can no man have than that he lay down his life for his friends and in this is proved christ’s love towards us that he died for us wherein is proved the father’s love towards us in that he sent his only son to die for us as paul the aposde also says he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how hath he not also with him given us all things christ was delivered up by the father and dehvered up by judas is there no seeming likeness between these two acts judas is a betrayer then is god too a betrayer god forbid you say but what makes the difference between the father delivering up the son the son delivering up himself and judas the dis ciple delivering up his master in that father and son did it in charity judas in treachery you see we have to look not at 7 prov 5 16 f i cor 11 29 9 ezek 36.20 rom 8.32 3i6 augustine later works what a man does but with what mind and will he does it we find god the father in the very same act in which we find judas we bless the father and we execrate judas why so because we bless chanty and execrate wickedness how vast a good has come to mankind from the delivering up of christ but that was not what was in the mind of judas in the mind of god was the salvation whereby we are redeemed in the mind of judas the money for which he sold his lord the son himself thought upon the price he paid for us judas upon the price he took for selling him the difference in intention makes a differ ence in the acts though the thing is one yet when we measure it by the difference of intention the one lovable the other damnable we find that one is to be glorified and the other execrated such great virtue has charity you see that it alone divides it alone distinguishes the actions of men 8 we have been marking this in similar actions when we look at differing actions we find that charity may cause a man to be fierce and wickedness to speak smoothly a boy may be struck by has father and have fair words from a slave dealer were you to offer a choice between blows and smooth words who would not choose the fair words and shun the blows but if you look to the persons from whom they come it is charity that strikes and wickedness that ingratiates you see the point we are making that the actions of men are discerned only according to their root in charity many things can be done that look well yet do not issue from the root of charity thorns too have their flowers some actions seem harsh or savage but are performed for our discipline at the dictate of charity thus a short and simple precept is given you once for all love and do what you wiu.ii whether you keep silence keep silence in love whether you exclaim exclaim in love whether you cor rect correct in love whether you forbear forbear in love let love’s root be within you and from that root nothing but good can spring 9 herein is love herein is manifested the love of god to wards us that god sent his only begotten son into this world that we might live through him herein is love not that we loved him but that he loved us we did not first love him he loved us to the end that we might love him and he sent his son to be the propitiator for our sins propitiator that is offerer of sacrifice he offered sacrifice for our sins where did u see introduction p 257 and cf below 11 here augustine has luator instead of the consistent vulgate propittatto homilies on i john 317 he find the offering the pure victim that he would offer be cause he could find no other he offered himself beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another peter the lord says lovest thou me and peter said i love thee feed my sheep 10 no man hath seen god at any time god is an invisible reality he is to be sought not with the eye but with the heart if we would see the light of the sun we must keep clear the bodily eye which is our means of beholding it so if we would see god let us cleanse the eye with which god can be seen and the place of that eye we may learn from the gospel blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god 12 only let not the desire of the eyes fashion our thought of god one may easily imagine for oneself some vast form or some measureless im mensity extended through space as it might be this light which our eyes can see increased to the limit and flooding the land scape or one may picture some old man of venerable aspect but our thoughts are not to go that way there is true matter for your thought if you would see god god is love what out ward appearance what form what stature hands or feet has love none can say and yet love has feet which take us to the church love has hands which give to the poor love has eyes which give intelligence of him who is in need as the psalm says blessed is he who bethinks himself of the needy and poor i 2 love has ears of which the lord says he that hath ears for hearing let him hear i all these are not members set each in their own place he that has charity sees the whole at once with the understanding’s grasp dwell there and you shall be dwelt in abide and there shae be abiding in you my brothers one does not love what one cannot see why then when you hear the praise of chanty are you stirred to acclama tion and applause what have i displayed to your eyes no vivid colours no gold or silver no gems of the treasure house my own face has not changed in speaking this body of mine looks as it did when i entered the church and so do all of you you hear the praise of charity and your voices nng out cer tainly there is nothing for you to see but let that same delight in charity which makes you acclaim it lead you to hold it fast in your heart listen to me my brothers here is a great treasure which i would urge you with all the power that god gives me to win for yourselves suppose you were shown some cup finely wrought and gilded which charmed your eye and 12 matt 5 8 12 ps 41 1 14 luke 8 8 augustine later works 318 compelled your admiration delighting you by the artist’s skill the weight of the silver and the gleam of the metal any of you might exclaim if only that cup were mine the words would be wasted for you could not make them come true or if one were bent on possessing it he might meditate the stealing of it out of the owner’s house now you have heard the praise of charity if it delights you take it for your own no need to com mit any robbery no need to think of the purchase price it is yours for nothing take hold of it clasp it to yourself no pos session can be sweeter if it be such to the hearing of it what must it be in the owning ii if there be any of you my brothers that would get charity and keep it you must above all avoid thinking of it as a poor inactive thing wanting no more than a sort of gentle mildness for its keeping or even a careless indifference charity is not kept in that way you are not to suppose that you love your servant when you do not beat him or love your son when you relax your discipline over him or love your neighbour when you never find fault with him that is not charity but weakness let charity be zealous to set right to correct faults to delight in good behaviour but to correct and improve what is bad love the man not his errors for god made the man his errors are his own doing love what god has made not what man has done in loving the first you remove the second in loving the one you amend the other and if sometimes you must be harsh or angry let it be for love of righting the wrong that is why charity is shown by the dove which came down upon the lord the appearance of the dove was that under which came the holy spirit by whom charity was to be poured into us and the reason is that the dove has no gall and though it fight for its nest with beak and wings its anger is without bitterness so does a father act when he chastens his son his purpose is discipline as i said before the kidnapper who would sell the boy gives him fair words with a foul intent the father who would correct him puts no gall into his chastising be so yourselves with all men here my brothers is a good pattern a good rule all of you have sons or hope to have them or if any of you have re solved to have no sons of your body he will desire spiritual children is there one that does not correct his son or any son who does not receive discipline from his father yet there must be an appearance there of anger love can be angry charity can be angry with a kind of anger in which there is no gall like the dove’s and not the raven’s homilies on i john 319 and this suggests to me my brethren a word on that schism which violators of charity have brought about for their hatred of charity has been matched by their hate for the dove but the dove convicts them the dove that comes forth from heaven as the heavens are opened and stays over the lord’s head and wherefore so for the hearing of these words this is he that baptizeth i5 back brigands back usurpers of christ’s estate upon those estates over which you seek to rule you have dared to post the title deeds of a greater owner he recognizes his titles and claims his own estate he will not erase the titles but he will enter and possess his own so when one comes into the catholic church there is no cancelling of his baptism no erasing of the emperor’s title the title is acknowledged the owner enters under his own titles where the brigand had entered under a title that was not his is john 1 33 see introduction p 256 eighth homily i john 4 12 16 4 it may have occurred to some of you since we have been expounding this episde of john to ask why the charity which he so strongly commends is only brotherly love he speaks of him that loveth his brother and of the command ment given to us that we love one another brotherly charity is continually spoken of but of the charity of god the charity that is whereby we love god there is not such constant men tion though it is not altogether passed over in silence on the other hand there is scarcely a word in the whole epistle about the love of enemies in all his urgent preaching and commenda tion of charity he does not tell us to love our enemies only to love our brethren yet just now in our reading of the gospel we heard the text if ye love them that love you what reward have you do not the publicans the same how is it then that john the apostle enjoins brotherly love upon us as the great means towards our perfecting while our lord says that it is not enough for us to love our brothers but that love itself must stretch so far as to reach our enemies the reaching to enemies does not mean the passing over of brothers our love like a fire must first take hold of what is nearest and so spread to what is further off a brother is nearer to you than a casual stranger and again you are closer to the man whom you do not know but who is not opposed to you than to the enemy who is your love should extend to your neighbours but that is not to be called exten sion love for those who are linked to you is much the same as love for yourself extend it to such as you do not know who yet have done no harm to you and now go further than them and reach to the love of enemies that certainly is our 1 matt 5.46 320 homilies on i john 32i lord’s command why then has john said nothing of loving an enemy 5 all love even the love we call carnal for which the more usual latin word is not dilectio but amoty dilectio being commonly used and understood in a higher sense all love my dear brothers implies necessarily an element of goodwill towards those who are loved whether we use the word dihgere or amare as the lord did when he said to peter lovest amas thou me we should not indeed we cannot love men in the sense in which a glutton will say i love partridges the object of his love being the killing and eating them he says he loves but the effect for the partridges is to put an end to their existence he loves their destruction the love of food can only purport its consumption and our own refreshment men are not to be loved as things to be consumed but in the manner of friendship and goodwill leading us to do things for the benefit of those we love and if there is nothing we can do goodwill alone is enough for the lover we should not want there to be unfortunates so that we may exercise works of mercy you give bread to the hungry but it would be better that no one should hunger and that you should not have to give you clothe the naked would that all were so clothed that there were no need for it you bury the dead but we long for that life in which there is no dying you reconcile men at law with one another but we long for the ever lasting peace of jerusalem where all quarrels are at an end all these are the services called out by man’s needs remove dis tress and there will be no place for works of mercy works of mercy will cease but there will be no quenching of the fire of charity you may have the truest love for a happy man on whom you have nothing to bestow such love will have a greater sincerity and a far more unspoilt purity once you have be stowed gifts on the unfortunate you may easily yield to the temptation to exalt yourself over him to assume superiority over the object of your benefaction he fell into need and you supplied him you feel yourself as the giver to be a bigger man than the receiver of the gift you should want him to be your equal that both may be subject to the one on whom no favour can be bestowed 8 the true christian will never set himself up over other men god gave you a place above the beasts in which you are of more value than they that is your natural privilege always to be better than a beast if you would be better than another man you will grudge to see him as your equal you ought to a l w 21 322 augustine later works wish all men equal to yourself and if you have gone beyond another man in wisdom you should want him too to show him self wise while he is stiu backward he may learn of you while he is ignorant he has need of you and you appear as teacher he as learner as teacher you are the superior as learner he is the inferior unless you want him to be your equal you will be for having him always as the learner and that will make you a grudging teacher but what sort of teaching will a grudging teacher give i can only beg you not to teach him your grudg ingness listen to the apostle’s words which come from the true heart of charity i would that all men were such as i myself 2 see how he wanted all to be his equals and just because charity made him so desire he was raised above all man has transgressed his proper limit created higher than the beasts he has let covetousness carry him away so that he might be higher than other men and that is pride 9 consider now the works that pride may do notice how they may resemble or even equal those of charity charity feeds the hungry so does pride charity to the praise of god pride to the praise of itself charity clothes the naked so does pride charity fasts so does pride charity buries the dead so does pride all the good works that are willed and done by chanty may be set m motion by its contrary pride like horses harnessed to a car but when charity is the inward driver pride must give place pride which is not so much misgoverning as misgoverned it goes ill with the man who has pride for his charioteer for he is sure to be overturned how can we know or see that it be not pride which governs the good deed where is the proof we see the works hunger is fed by compassion but also by pride strangers are entertained by compassion but also by pride poverty is protected by compassion but also by pride in the works themselves we can see no difference i would go further though it is not i but paul who says it charity goes to death a man that is who has charity confesses the name of christ and becomes a martyr and pride also may do both the one has charity the other has not but let this other mark the apostle’s words tf i give au my goods to the poor and if i give my body to burn and have not charity it profiteth me nothing so holy scripture recalls us from all this outward showing recalls us from the surface appearance displayed be fore men to the inward truth come back to your own con science and question it pay heed not to the visible flowering 2 i cor 7 7 3 i cor 13 3 homilies on i john 323 but to the root beneath the ground is covetousness at the root then you may have a show of good deeds but of works truly good there can be none is charity at the root be easy for no evil can be the issue the proud may speak fair words love may show anger the one may clothe the other may smite the one clothes for the pleasing of men the other smites for the cor rection of discipline the stroke of charity is more to be wel comed than the alms of pride come back then my brothers into the place within and in whatsoever you do look for the wit ness of god see as he sees the intention of your acts if your heart does not accuse you of acting for the sake of display it is weu you may be easy and when you do well have no fear of another’s seeing fear only to act so that you may have praise for yourself let the other see so that god may have the praise if you hide what you do from man’s eyes you are hiding it against man’s imitation and robbing god of his praise there are two parties for whose benefit you give alms two are hungry the one for bread the other for righteousness for it is written blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled between these two hungering ones you are set for the working of good if charity is the worker it has compassion for both it see to give help to both for while the one looks for food the other looks for an example to follow as you feed the first offer yourself to the second and you have given alms to both you have enabled the one to give thanks for the ending of his hunger the other to imitate the example shown him 10 let your works of mercy then proceed from a merciful heart for then even in your love of enemies you will be showing love of brothers do not think that john has given no charge concerning love of one’s enemy for he has said much of brotherly charity and it is always the brother that you love how so you ask i ask in turn why do you love your enemy because you wish him to have good health in this life but sup pose that is not in his interest because you wish him to be rich but if riches themselves should rob him of his sight to marry a wife but if that should bring him a hfe of bitterness to have children but suppose they turn out badly thus there is un certainty in all the things you seem to desire for your enemy because you love him uncertainty everywhere let your desire for him be that together with you he may have eternal life let your desire for him be that he may be your brother and if that 4 matt 5 6 augustine later works 324 is what you desire in loving your enemy that he may be your brother when you love him you love a brother you love in him not what he is but what you would have him be once before if i remember right my dear people i put to you this parable imagine the trunk of a tree lying before you a good carpenter may see such a piece of timber unhewn as it was cut in the forest he loves it at sight but because he means to make something out of it the reason for his love is not that it may always remain as it is as craftsman he has looked at what it shall be not as lover at what it is and his love is set upon what he will make of it not upon its present state even so has god loved us sinners god we say has loved sinners for we have his word they that are whole need not a physician but they that are sick but surely his love for us sinners is not to the end that we remain in our sin like trees from the wood we have been looked on by the carpenter and his thought turns to the building he will make of us not to the timber that we were so may you look upon your enemy standing against you with his angry passion his biting words his provolang insults his unrelenting hate but in au this you need think only that he is a man you see all the hostility to yourself as of the man’s making and you see in himself god’s making that he was made to be a man is the act of god his hatred of you his mahce against you is his own and what do your say in your heart lord have mercy on him forgive him his sins put fear in him and change him you love in him not what he is but what you would have him be and thus when you love your enemy you love a brother therefore the perfection of love is the love of an enemy and this perfect love consists in brotherly love it is not to be held that the apostle john enjoins upon us a lesser degree of chanty and the lord jesus a greater john indeed instructs us to love our brothers christ to love even our enemies but you must consider why christ has bidden you love your enemies it cannot be with the intent that they should always remain such that would be an instruction to hate not to love consider the manner of his own love for them which was a will that they should not con tinue his persecutors father he says forgive them for they know not what they do the will for their pardoning was a wiu for their transformation in willing that they should be transformed he deigned to make brothers out of enemies and so in very truth he did he was killed and buried he rose again 5 matt 9 12 luke 23 34 homilies on i john 325 and ascended into heaven he sent the holy spirit upon his disciples they began with confidence to preach his name they worked miracles in the name of the crucified and slain and those who had done the lord to death saw what was done that blood which they had shed in fury they drank in faith ii i have spoken of au this my brethren somewhat lengthily but if charity was to be urged upon you my people with the force demanded there was no other way if there is in you nothing of charity all i have said comes to nothing but if it exists at all in you my words should be as oil upon the flames and perhaps they may have kindled it even where it was not in one what was already there will have grown in another what was not may have begun to be i have spoken in order to stir up your backwardness in the love of enemies if a man is passionate against you meet his passion with prayer if he hates you meet his hatred with pity it is the fever in his soul that hates you when he is cured he will show his gratitude think of the physician’s love for the sick he does not love them as sick men if he did he would want them always to be sick he loves the sick not so that they may remain sick men but so that they may become healthy instead of sick and how much he may have to suffer from them in their delirium abuse not seldom blows the physician attacks the fever and excuses the man is this loving his enemy truer to say that he is hating his real enemy disease that is what he hates w hile he loves the man that strikes at him his hatred then is for the fever for the blows are struck at him by the disease the sickness the fever the physician takes away the thing that shows hostility to him in order that the man may live to give him thanks so with you if your enemy hates you and hates you unjustly you know that it is because the lusts of this world have the mastery in him if you meet his hate with hate you are returning evil for evil and what comes of that i had to lament for one sick man who hated you now if you are hating also i must mourn for two but you say he has attacked your property he is robbing you of some earthly possession or other you hate him because he is making this life strait for you you need not suffer such straitening for you can take your journey into the heaven above lifting up your heart to the wide realm of freedom where in the hope of life eternal there is no straitness to be borne think what it really is of which he would rob you and remem ber that he could not even do that were he not permitted by 326 augustine later works the father who chasteneth every son that he receiveth your enemy himself is as it were god’s operating instrument to work your own healing if god knows it to be for your good that he should despoil you he allows it if god knows it to be for your good to be beaten he allows your enemy to strike you god is using him to make you whole pray that he too may be given healing 12 no man hath ever seen god see my beloved if we love one another god shall abide in us and his love shall be perfected in us make a beginning of love and you shall be made perfect for if you have begun to love god has begun to dwell in you love him who has begun to dwell in you so that by a more perfect indwelhng he may make you perfect hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us because he has given us of his spirit it is well thanks be to god we know that he dwells in us and how do we know that we know it because john himself tells us that he has given us of his spirit how do we know that how do you know that he has given you of his spirit ask your heart if it is full of charity you have the spirit of god how do we know that this is evidence for you of god’s spirit dwelling in you ask paul the apostle because the charity of god is shed abroad in our hearts through the holy spirit that is given us s 13 and we have seen and are witnesses that the father sent his son to be the saviour of the world sick men be at your ease if such a physician has come to you there can be no despairing grave were your diseases incurable your wounds desperate your sickness but if you think of the gravity of your trouble think also of the omnipotence of the physician you are desperate but he is omnipotent and his witnesses are they who first were healed and who now proclaim the physician although their own healing were in hope rather than in fulfil ment as the apostle says in hope we are saved so we have begun to be healed in faith and our salvation will be per fected when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality that is hope not fulfilment but he that rejoices in hope shall lay hold of the fulfilment to which he that has not hope can never attain 14 whosoever confesses that jesus is the son of god god abideth in him and he in god we need not now insist at length that this confessing must be not in word but in deed 7 heb 12 6 8 rom 5 5 9 rom 8.24 homilies on i john 327 not of the tongue but of the hfe for there are many that confess in words what their deeds deny and we have known and have believed what love god hath in us again how have you known this god is love he has said it before and now says it again you could not have a fuller commendation of love than the naming of it with god’s name you might possibly have thought little of god’s gift but can you think little of god god is love and he that abideth in love abideth in god and god abideth in him there is a mutual indwelling of the holder and the held your dwelling in god means that you are held by him god’s dwelling in you means that he holds you lest you fall think of yoursetf as being made a house of god but not like the house of bricks and mortar that carries you m the body if that house should go from under you you fall but god does not fall if you go from under him he is whole and entire when you desert him whole and entire when you return to him your healing brings no gift to him it is you that are cleansed you that are amended and re created he is medi cine to the unhealthy rule to the crooked light to the darkened dwelling to the homeless the imparting is all to you and you may not suppose that when you come to god there is aught imparted to him even the possession of a slave god will not lack servants though you refuse though all refuse his service god has no need of servants but servants have need of god hence the words of the psalm i have said unto the lord thou art my god yes god is the true lord because thou needest not my goods you need the good your servant pro vides he needs the good you provide for him in feeding him and you need the good he provides for you by his service for yourself you cannot do all the drawing of water the cooking the running before your carriage the grooming of your beast you are m want of the good your servant furnishes you are in want of his attendance and inasmuch as you want an inferior you are no true lord the true lord is he who seeks nothing from us and it goes ill with us if we seek not him he seel nothing from us yet he sought us when we were not seeking him one sheep had gone astray he found it and brought it home upon his shoulders rejoicing was the sheep a necessity for the shepherd or not rather the shepherd a necessity for the sheep i am loth you see to reach the end of this epistle just because there is no theme on which i would fainer speak than charity 10 ps 16 2 luke 15.4 328 augustine later works and no other scripture extols charity with greater warmth for you there can be no sweeter matter of discourse no food more healthful for your squls but only if by good living you confirm in yourselves the gift of god be not unthankful for this won drous grace of god god who possessing one only begotten son willed not that son to be alone but adopted us to be his brothers and share with him eternal hfe ninth homily i john 4 17 21 i you will remember my dear people that we have still to treat and expound to you as the lord shall enable us the last part of john’s epistle i have not forgotten my debt and you should not forget to demand it of me for that same charity which is the chief if not the sole theme of this epistle will make me most faithful m acknowledging my debt and you most wel come in demanding it most welcome in demanding for de mands are unpleasant where there is not charity but where there is they are welcome and for him on whom they are made though they involve labour yet the labour is lightened or even nullified by charity itself can we not see even in dumb un reasoning creatures where there is no spiritual charity but only one that belongs to the fleshly nature with what eager insistence the mother’s milk is demanded by her little ones yet however rough be the suckling’s onset upon the udder the mother likes it better than if there were no sucking no demanding of the debt that charity admits indeed we often see the bigger calf butting with its head at the cow’s udders and the mother’s body forced upward by the pressure yet she will never kick her calf away but if the young one be not there to suck she will low for him to come to it of spiritual charity the apostle says i have become little among you like a nurse cherishing her children 1 if such charity be in us we cannot but love you when you press your demand upon us backwardness in you we do not love it makes us afraid of the failing of your strength the occurrence of certain set lessons for the festal days which we were obliged to read and discourse upon has compelled us to leave for a time the text of our episde but now we are to 1 i thess 2 7 329 330 augustine later works return to the course which was broken and i ask your devout attention to what remains 2 herein is love made perfect in us that we may have confidence in the day of judgment because as he is so are we m this world this tells us how every man may test the progress of charity in him or rather his own progress in charity for if charity is god in god there can be neither progress nor regress and charity is only said to make progress in you inasmuch as you make progress in charity ask therefore how far you have progressed in charity and listen to the answer of your heart that you may know the measure of your progress john has promised to show us how we may know it saying herein is love made perfect in us herein that we may have con fidence in the day of judgment in every man that has con fidence in the day of judgment charity is made perfect to have confidence in the day of judgment is not to fear its coming there are men who do not believe in a day of judgment and they cannot have confidence in a day which they do not believe will come we can leave them aside may god awaken them into life but of the dead we will say nothing they do not be lieve in a coming day of judgment and neither fear nor desire that in which they do not believe but for any man that has begun to believe in a day of judgment the beginning of belief is the beginning of fear so long as he fears he cannot have confidence in the day of judgment and not yet is charity made perfect in him yet there is no cause for despair where you see a beginning why despair of the end and fear itself is a begin ning as scripture says the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom 2 a man has begun to fear the day of judgment let fear make him amend himself let him keep watch against the sins that are his enemies let him begin to renew the life within him and as the apostle says to mortify his members that are upon the earth the members upon the earth mean the spiritual things of wickedness the greediness and uncleanness and the rest which the text proceeds to recount in the measure in which he that has begun to fear the day of judgment mortifies his members upon the earth the heavenly members arise and gain strength these heavenly members are all kinds of good works and as they arise the man begins to desire that which he was fearing he feared lest christ should come and find in him godlessness for condemnation now he desires christ’s coming because he is to find godliness ready to 2 ps ii 10 3 col 3 5 f homilies on i john 33i be crowned when the soul has begun to long for christ’s coming the chaste soul that longs for the husband’s embrace she forswears the adulterer becommg inwardly virgin in the power of faith hope and chanty and now she has confidence in the day of judgment there is no inner conflict in her prayer thy kingdom come he who fears the coming of god’s king dom must fear lest this prayer be heard and it is a strange sort of prayer that fears to be heard but he who prays in the con fidence of charity truly desires that the kingdom may come and so my brothers do all that you can to train yourselves to long for the day of judgment for the perfection of charity is attested only when a longing for that day has begun to arise to long for it is to have confidence in it and to have confidence in it is to have no alarm of conscience in the charity that is perfect and pure 3 herein is his love made perfect in us that we may have confidence in the day of judgment wherefore shall we have confidence because as he is so are we in this world the meaning of this is to be understood in reference to chanty itself the lord says in the gospel if ye love them that love you what reward have you do not the publicans the same then he tells us what he would have us do but i say unto you love your enemies and pray for them that persecute you and for the command to love our enemies he gives us our pattern in god himself saying that ye may be sons of your father which is in heaven god loves his enemies for god is he who maketh his sun to rise on the good and the evil and raineth upon the just and the unjust thus the perfection to which god calls us is that of loving our enemies as he has loved his own and so our confidence in the day of judgment is because as he is even so are we in this world as he loves his enemies making his sun to rise on the good and the evil and raining upon the just and the unjust so we though we cannot give sun and rain to our enemies may give them our tears when we pray for them 4 and now observe what the epistle says about this very con fidence how are we to recognize the perfection of charity there is no fear in charity what then of the man who has begun to fear the day of judgment if charity were perfect in him he would not fear for perfect charity would make perfect righteousness and he would have no cause for fear rather he would have cause for longing that wickedness pass away and god’s kingdom come therefore there is no fear in charity matt 5 44 ff augustine later works 332 but this is true not of charity’s beginnings perfect charity he continues casteth out fear fear then may be a starting point for the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom fear as it were prepares the place for charity but when char ity has taken up its dwelling the fear that prepared the place for it is expelled as one grows the other diminishes as charity moves to the centre fear is driven outside the greater the charity the lesser the fear the lesser the charity the greater the fear but if there has been no fear there is no way for charity to enter when we sew a seam the thread must be let in by the needle the needle goes in first but it must come out if the thread is to follow so fear takes first hold upon the mind but does not stay there because the purpose of its entry was to let charity in and once the quiet of fearlessness is established in the soul what joy is ours whether in this world or in the world to come even in this world who shall harm us if we are filled with charity hear the apostle’s triumphant cry who shall separate us from the charity of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecu tion or hunger or nakedness or peril or sword and again in the words of peter and who is he that can harm you if ye be followers of that which is good there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment the heart is tormented by con sciousness of sins justification has not yet come there is that within which pricks and stings so in the verses of the psalm which speak of the perfecting of righteousness thou hast turned for me my mourning into joy thou hast stripped off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness so that my glory may sing unto thee and my pricking is ended pricldng is ended when the goad of conscience is stilled fear is a goad but you are not to fear for charity enters with healing for the wound of fear the fear of god wounds like the surgeon’s knife it cuts out the festering part and seems to enlarge the wound when there was festering in the body the wound was smaller but it was dangerous the pain was not so sharp as now at the touch of the surgeon’s knife the treating of it may hurt more than if it had no treatment but the added pain in the application of the cure serves to end pain for good by the recovery of health therefore let fear take hold of your heart that it may give an entry to charity let the surgeon’s knife make way for the healing scar such is our surgeon’s skill that not even a scar may show you have only to submit yourself to his hand for if you are 5 rom 8 35 i peter 3 13 ps 30 1 1 f homilies on i john 333 without fear you will not be able to be justified that is the word of scnpture he that is without fear shall not be able to be justified 8 so there must needs first enter fear by means of which chanty can come in fear is the remedy charity is health he that feareth is not made perfect m love and that is because fear hath torment hke the surgeon’s incision 5 there is indeed another text which may seem to contra dict this if it be not rightly understood we read in a certain passage of the psalms the fear of the lord is pure enduring for ever and ever 9 that points us to an everlasting fear that yet is pure but if so is there a contradiction to it in the words of our epistle there is no fear in charity but perfect charity casteth out fear let us enquire of both these oracles of god the spirit that speaks is one though there be two books two mouths two tongues one and the same breath may blow two fiutes and cannot one and the same spirit fill two hearts and set two tongues in motion but if two flutes filled by one spirit one breathing may sound in harmony is it possible that two tongues moved by the spirit of god should be discordant there must then here be some harmony some concord that demands a sympathetic ear the spirit of god has filled by his inspiration two hearts and two mouths has moved two tongues of one tongue we hear there is no fear in charity but perfect charity casteth out fear of the other we hear the fear of the lord is pure enduring for ever and ever well is there a dis cord between the sounds no you must listen with care and observe the melody not for nothing does the word pure come in the one saying and not in the other there must be one kind of fear that is caued pure and another kind that is not let us distinguish these two fears and then we may grasp the harmony of the fiutes how shall we do this listen my people there are men who fear god because they fear to be cast into hell to bum with the devil in everlasting fire this is the fear that makes an opening for charity but it enters only to go out again if as yet it is the thought of punishment that makes you fear god not yet do you love him whom so you fear you are not longing for good things you are but apprehensive of evil but that very apprehension leads you to amend yourself and so to begin to long for the good things and when you begin to do 8 ecclesiasticus i 22 the text has unrighteous anger shall not be able to be justified ai ustine may be quotmg from memory as often the context in ecclesiasticus is the fear of the lord 9 ps ig g 334 augustine later works that the pure fear will arise in you the fear of losing what is good it is one thing you see to fear god lest he send you to hell with the devil it is another to fear god lest he depart from you the first fear is not yet pure for it comes not of the love of god but of the fear of punishment but when you fear god lest his presence leave you you are embracing him and longing to enjoy him 6 the diference between these two fears the one which charity casts out and the other pure and enduring for ever may best be shown by thinking of two married women differing in character suppose one of these two to be drawn towards adultery to take pleasure in the wicked desire but to fear the judgment of her husband she fears her husband but this fear comes of her still loving wickedness to her the husband’s pre sence is not welcome but burdensome and if she does live in sin she fears her husband’s coming of such are they who fear the coming of the day of judgment suppose the other to love her husband to own her duty to him in pure embraces never admitting a stain of infidelity upon her thoughts this one will long for her husband’s presence yet there will be fear in her no less than in the other how are the two fears to be distinguished you may put the same question to both of them do you fear for your husband both will answer i do the same words but with a different meaning for if you go on to ask why the one will say i am afraid of his coming and the other i am afraid of his going away one says i fear to be found guilty the other i fear to be left alone now apply this to the mind of the christian and you will find the fear that charity casts out and the other pure fear that endures for ever and ever 7 let us then address ourselves first to those who fear god with the fear of the woman who finds pleasure in wickedness fearing her husband’s judgment on her guilt soul we will say thou that fearest god for his judgment as the woman who finds pleasure in wickedness fears her husband if such a woman be misliking to thee mislike thyself would you have your own wife fear you for that reason would you not rather she were chaste for love of you and not for fear then show yourself to god as you would that your wife should be to you pray god to look upon you and turn his face from your sins there is only one way of deserving that god’s face be turned from your sins and that is never to turn your own face from them you have the very words in the psalm for i confess my homilies on i john 335 wickedness and my sin is ever before me o do you make con fession and god will pardon 8 such is our address to that soul in which is still the fear that does not endure for ever and ever but is shut out and ban ished by charity let us speak now to that other soul which possesses already the pure fear enduring for ever and ever gan we suppose that this soul is to be found and addressed is there such do you think among our people in this church in this whole earth such there must be though unseen it is winter but within there is freshness and vigour at the root maybe our words will reach that soul’s ears but wherever it be i would fain come upon it and rather than have it listen to me lend it my own ears it should teach me rather than learn of me a holy soul all aflame with longing for god’s kingdom it shall hear not me but god himself speaking to it and comforting its patient sojourn on this earth with words like these already thou wouldest i should come and i know that thou wouldest it i know what thou art that thou mayest await my coming with confidence i know that the waiting is irksome to thee yet wait the rather and be patient i come and i come quickly yet to the lover it seems slow you may hear that soul’s yearning song like a lily among the thorns hear her sighs i will make music with understanding in the unspotted way when wilt thou come unto me but in the unspotted way there is no need for fearing because perfect charity casteth out fear yet even when she has reached the embrace of her beloved she will fear though without anxiety she will take heed and watch against her iniquity lest she fall again into sin fearing not to be cast into hell fire but to be left by him alone so there will be in her the pure fear that endure th for ever and ever such is the music the harmonious music of our two flutes both tell of a kind of fear but one tells of the soul’s fear of judg ment the other of the soul’s fear of desertion one is the fear which charity excludes the other is the fear that endures for ever and ever 9 we are to love because he first loved us how indeed should we love had he not first loved us through loving we have become friends but it was as enemies that he loved us in order that we might be made friends he first loved us and bestowed on us the power to love him as yet we loved him not through loving we are made fair an ugly and misshapen man may love a beautiful woman or an ugly and misshapen woman 10 ps 51 3 11 ps ioi:i f 336 augustine later works of dull complexion may love a handsome man but love can make beautiful neither the man nor the woman the man lo es a fair woman and when he looks on himself in the glass he is ashamed to raise his face to the beauty of her whom he loves he can do nothing to make himself beautiful if he waits for beauty to come to mm waiting will make him old and his face plainer there is nothing he can do no advice you can give him but to restrain his passion and venture no more to set his love upon an unequal match if he loves and would marry a wife he must desire modesty in her and not physical charm but our soul my brethren is ugly through its iniquity through loving god it is made fair what manner of love is this that transforms the lover into beauty god is ever beautiful never ugly never changing he that is ever beautiful he first loved us and loved none that were not ugly and misshapen yet the end of his love was not to leave us ugly but to transform us creating beauty in place of deformity and how shall we win this beauty but through loving him who is ever beautiful beauty grows in you with the growth of love for charity itself is the soul’s beauty we are to love because he first loved us 10 if any man say i love god ask anyone you will to tell you if he loves god he will make loud profession i do love god god knows it but there is another matter on which he may be questioned if any man says i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar why is he a liar because he that loves not his brother whom he sees how can he love god whom he sees not does it then follow that he who loves his brother loves god also of necessity he must love god of necessity he must love love itself he cannot love his brother and not love love he cannot help loving love and if he loves love he needs must love god in loving love he is loving god you cannot have forgotten the words that came a httle earlier god is love if god is love whoever loves love loves god therefore love your brothef and have no other care you cannot say i love my brother but not god just as to say i love god when you do not love your brother is to lie so when you say i love my brother you are deceived if you imagine that you do not love god you love your brother and must needs love love itself but love is god therefore whoever loves his brother must needs be loving god if you do not love the brother whom you see how can you love god whom you do not see why does a man not see god no cf the same argument in de tnn viii 10 vii ff homilies on i john 337 because he has not love he has not love because he does not love his brother and it follows that the reason for his not seeing god is that he has not love if he had love he must see god for god is love by love the heart’s eye must continually be cleansed and strengthened for the sight of that changeless being in whose presence the lover may ever delight and enjoy it in the society of angels unto all eternity but now he must run his course so that one day he may rejoice in his true fatherland he may not love his pilgrimage or the way along it nothing may be sweet to him save the god who calls us until the day that we cleave fast to him saying with the psalmist thou hast destroyed all them that commit fornication against thee 12 the fornicators against him are they that turn aside and love the world your part is told you in the verse that follows for me it is good to cleave fast unto god that is my whole good to cleave unto god looking for nought else if you ask why cleave to god and a man should say for that which he will give me ask him again what god will give him god made the heaven god made the earth what is there for him to give you if already you cleave fast to him what better thing can you find if you could he would give it ii he that loves not his brother whom he sees how can he love god whom he sees not and this commandment we have from him that he who loves god love his brother also proudly you spoke the word i love god and you hate your brother murderer that you are how can you love god did you not hear earlier in the epistle that he that hateth his brother is a murderer indeed indeed you say i love god though i hate my brother indeed indeed if you hate your brother you do not love god let me prove it by another text again we read that he gave us a commandment that we should love one another can you love him whose commandment you hate can anyone say i love the emperor but i hate his laws it is by the observation of his laws published through his empire that the emperor is aware of your love for him our emperor’s law is this a new commandment give i unto you that ye love one another you say you love christ then keep his com mandment and love your brother if you do not love your brother how can you love him whose commandment you despise my brothers i can never tire of speaking in christ’s name of charity the more you covet possession of it the more i hope 12 ps 73 27 f 13 i john 3 23 w john 13 34 338 augustine later works will charity itself grow within you casting out fear so that there remain the pure fear that endures for ever and ever let us bear this world bear all its afflictions bear the offences of our temp tations let us never go back on our journeying let us hold to the church’s unity hold to christ hold to charity let us not be sundered from the members of his bride nor sundered from the faith that we may make our boast in his presence and so we shall abide safe in him in this present time by faith and in the time to come by sight whereof in the gift of the holy spirit we have so sure a pledge tenth homily i john 5 1 3 i those of you who were present yesterday will remember no doubt the place our exposition has reached in the course of this epistle he that loveth not his brother whom he sees how can he love god whom he does not see and this commandment we have from him that he who loves god love his brother also that was the verse at which we ended now let us see what comes next every one that believeth that jesus is the christ is bom of god who is the man that does not believe that jesus is the christ he that does not live as christ commanded there are many that say i believe but faith without works cannot save the work of faith is love according to the apostle paul’s saying faith which worketh through love 1 that is the faith that jesus is the christ as it is believed by christians who are such not in n ttip only but in deed and in life it is not as the devils be lieve they believe as scripture says and tremble 2 one might suppose that devils faith could go no further than the confes sion we know who thou art the son of god what the devils said was what peter said when the lord asked who he was and what men called him the disciples answered some call thee john the baptist others elias others jeremias or one of the prophets and when he asked again and whom say ye that i am peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god then came the lord’s saying to him blessed art thou simon bar jona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven see what commendation is given to this faith of peter s thou art 1 gal 5 26 3 matt 8 19 2 james 2 19 matt 16.13 ff 339 augustine later works 340 peter and upon this rock will i build my church upon this rock means upon this faith upon the saying thou art the christ the son of the hving god upon this rock says the lord i will build my church a high commendation indeed thus peter says thou art the christ the son of the living god and the devils say we know who thou art the son of god the holy one of god what peter says the devils say also the words are the same but not the thought peter’s words we may be sure were spoken with love for love goes with the christian’s faith but not with the devils for peter’s words were meant to embrace the christ the devils were meant to make him depart from them for before saying we know who thou art thou art the son of god they had said what have we to do with thee why art thou come before the time to destroy us it is one thing to confess christ in order that you may hold to him another thing to confess christ in order that you may thrust him from you you see then that the words of our text he that believeth denote a faith of a special kind not the faith that may be held by many therefore my brothers let no heretic say to you we also believe i have given you the example of the devils that you may examine the deeds of men’s lives before rejoicing at the words of their belief let us see then what is meant by belief in christ by belief that jesus is the christ our text goes on every one that be lieveth that jesus is the christ is born of god but what does this belief mean and eveiy one that loveth him that begat him loveth him that is begotten of him with faith the apostle straightway conjoins love for without love faith is vain the christian’s faith has love together with it the devils faith is loveless those who do not believe at all are in worse state than the devils falling behind them in apprehension the man who will not believe in christ has not come so far as to do what the devils do he may reach the point of believing yet still hate him in whom he believes the confession of his faith being through fear of punishment not love for the offered prize and now he is like the devils who dreaded the punishment in store for them to such faith love must be added so that it becomes the faith that paul describes the faith that worketh through love and then you will have the christian the citizen of 5 in retr i 21 augustine refers to two other interpretations of the text which he has given one that the rock is peter another that the rock is christ between these two he invites the reader to choose which he thinks the more probable homilies on i john 34i jerusalem and fellow citizen of angels the pilgrim toiling eagerly on his way join him for he is your good comrade travel with him if only you be what he is 3 every one that loveth him that begat him loveth him that is begotten of him hereby we know that we love the sons of god what does this mean my brothers the apostle has just spoken of the son of god not of sons the one christ was set forth for our contemplation in the words every one that believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and every one that loveth him that begat that is the father loveth him that is begotten of him that is his son our lord jesus christ and he goes on hereby we know that we love the sons of god we should have expected hereby we know that we love the son of god but john having just spoken of the son of god now speaks of god’s sons it is because the sons of god are the body of god’s only son because he is head and we are members the son of god is still one therefore to love the sons of god is to love the son of god to love the son of god is to love the father none can love the father unless he love the son and he that loves the son loves also the sons of god these sons of god are the members of god’s son and he that loves them by loving becomes himself a member through love he becomes a part of the structure of christ’s body and thus the end will be the one christ loving himself for the love of the members for one another is the love of the body for itself if one member suffer all the members suffer with it and if one member have glorying all the members rejoice with it 7 on which the apostle concludes now ye are the body of christ and members of him so john speaking a little earlier of brotherly love has said he that loveth not his brother whom he sees how can he love god whom he sees not if you love your brother can it be said that you do so and yet do not love christ impossible when it is christ’s members that you love loving the members of christ you are loving christ loving christ you are loving the son of god loving the son of god you are loving the father there can be no separation of love you may choose for yourself what you will love and all the rest will follow you may say i love god only god the father that is not true if you love him you cannot love him only if you love the father you are this celebrated passage is the crown of augustine’s doctrine of the unity of christ and his church 7 i cor 12 26 f augustine later works 342 loving the son also suppose you grant that and say i love the father and i love the son but nothing more god the father and god the son our lord jesus christ who has ascended into heaven and sits on the right hand of the father the word through whom all things were made the word that was made flesh and dwelt among us i love nothing more that is not true if you love the head you love the members if you do not love the members neither do you love the head how can you not tremble at the voice of the head crying from heaven on the members behalf saul saul w persecutest thou me the persecutor of his members he called the per secutor of himself that was to call the lover of his members the lover of himself and who are his members my brethren you know they are none other than the church of god hereby we know that we love the sons of god because we love god how so are not the sons of god a different thing from god yes but he who loves god loves his commandments and what are they a new commandment give i unto you that ye love one another none may make one love an excuse from another christian love is altogether of one piece and as itself is compacted into a unity so it makes into one all that are linked to it like a flame fusing them together the lump of gold is fused in the furnace and a single object is made of it but un less the fire of charity is kindled there can be no fusing of the many into one 4 we are told flien how we may know that we love the sons of god it is because we love god and keep his com mandments we are troubled and wearied by the fficulty of keeping god’s commandment but listen friend you go through ton and labour for the love of what of avarice that love must bring toil to the lover there is no toil in the love of god avarice will enjoin upon you the endurance of labours dangers wear and tear and troubles and you will obey but to what purpose to gain the wherewithal to fill your purse and to lose your peace of mind peace of mind i dare say you had more before you were rich than after you began to be wealthy see what avarice has charged you with a houseful of goods and the fear of thieves gain of money and loss of sleep there is what avarice bade you do and you have done it and what is god’s charge love me you may love money and go after it yet maybe not find it whoever seeks me i am with him you may love place and position maybe you will never attain to acts 9 4 homilies on i john 343 them no man has ever loved me and failed of my attaining you would have a patron or a powerful friend and you must go about to approach him by way of some inferior love me god says to you i have not to be approached through any go between love itself sets you in my presence my brothers fiiere can be no sweetness greater than such love much to the point are the words of the psalm you have just heard the un righteous have spoken to me of delights but not as thy law o lord the law of god is god’s commandment and god’s commandment is that new commandment called new because it gives renewal a new commandment give i unto you that ye love one another that this is indeed the law of god is con firmed by the apostle’s saying bear ye one another’s burdens and so shall ye fulfil the law of christ that is the consum mation of all our works love there is the end for which and unto which we run our course when we reach it we shau have rest 7 for this is the love of god that we keep his command ments you have heard the saying on these two command ments hang all the law and the prophets you are spared the turning from one scripture page to another on these two commandments and they are thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and au thy soul and all thy mind and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself these are the com mandments of which the whole of our epistle speaks hold fast then to love and set your minds at rest you need not fear doing ill to anyone for who can do any ill to the person whom he loves love and you cannot but do well you may rebuke but that will be the act of love not of harshness you may use the rod but it will only be for discipline for the love of love itself will not suffer you to pass over the lack of discipline in another sometimes there is a kind of contrariness apparent in the products of hatred and of love hatred may use fair words and love may sound harshly a man may hate his enemy and pretend friendship towards him he may commend him when he sees him do wrong for he welcomes his thoughtlessness he is glad to see him rush headlong in pursuit of his desires where he may fall beyond hope of recovery he will in the words of the psalm commend the sinner in the desires of his soul 12 he will smooth his going with the oil of flattery hating yet com mending another seeing his friend do the like wiu call him 5 ps 119 85 10 gal 6 2 11 matt 22 37 ff 12 ps 10 3 augustine later works 344 back and if the friend will not hear he may use the language of reproof he may denounce he may even prosecute for sometimes things may come to the point where there is no avoiding an action at law thus we may see hatred speaking softly and charity prosecuting but neither soft speeches nor harsh re proofs are what you have to consider look for the spring search out the root from which they proceed the fair words of the one are designed for deceiving the prosecution of the other is aimed at reformation my brothers it is not for my preaching to work the enlarge ment of your hearts ask god that you may love one another and he will grant it you are to love all men even your enemies not because they are your brothers but in order that they may be so that brotherly love may ever burn within you whether for him who is already a brother or for your enemy that love may turn him into one wherever you love a brother you love a friend perhaps he stands already with you linked to you already in the catholic unity of the church if his life accords with it he whom you love is already a brother and not an enemy or if your love is given to one who has not yet believed in christ or who has beheved only as the devils believe you will reprove his folly you will love him and with a brotherly love for though he is not yet a brother the aim of your love is that he may be made one thus all our brotherly love is love for christian people for all the members of christ the learning of charity my brothers its vigour its flowers its fruit its beauty its pleasantness its sustenance its drink its food its loving embraces all these can never cloy and if god grants us such delights upon our pilgrimage what joys await us in our homeland 8 so my brothers let us make haste let us make haste and love the christ that christ is jesus and who is he the word of god the manner of his coming to our sick world is that the word was made flesh and dwelt among us thus has the prophecy of scripture been fulfilled it behoved christ to suffer and to rise again the third day from the dead 1 5 where is the place of his body where do his members carry on their labouring and where must you be to have over you the head and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name throughout all nations beginning at jerusalem there must your charity spread itself abroad the 13 augustine has the donatists m mind see introduction p 256 f 14 john 1 14 luke 24 46 f homilies on i john 345 word of christ the word of the psalm that is of god’s spirit proclaims thy commjindment is exceeding broad and there are men who set the boundary of charity in africa if you would love christ stretch out your charity over all the world for christ’s members are spread the world over if your love is for a part only you are sundered if sundered you are not in the body if not in the body you are not under the head there is no profit in the faith of a blasphemer you would worship him in ae head and you blaspheme him in the body he loves his body you may sever yourself firom the body of christ but the head cannot be severed from his own body in vain do you honour me cries the head fi:om above you in vain do you honour me imagine one that would kiss your head and trample on your feet crushing your feet with nailed boots yet seeking to embrace your head and kiss it would you not break through the speech of pretended honour with the cry what are you about sir you are trampling on me you would not say you trample on my head for honour was being done to your head but that head would make protest more for the trampled members than acknowledge the honour done to itself would not the head itself cry out i want none of your honouring cease to trample on me you may answer if you wiu where is the trampling you may tell the head you sought to kiss it to embrace it but have you not sense to see that what you seek to embrace is all of a piece in structural unity with that on which you trample you honour me above you trample me below and the pain of this exceeds the pleasure of that for the honoured head suffers for the trampled feet the tongue will exclaim that hurts me not that hurts my foot but that hurts me no use to ask the tongue who touched it who struck it pricked it or stabbed it the answer is no one but it is linked to those parts that suffer trampling and how should it not suffer pain when there is no separation be tween it and them 9 our lord jesus christ at his ascension into heaven on the fortieth day commended his body to lie on the earth where he had worn it and he did so because he saw that many would pay him honour for his ascension and that their honouring must be vain if they tread under foot his members upon earth and to forestall the ntiisprision of worshipping the head in heaven while trampling the feet upon earth he declared where his members should be found before his ascension he spoke his 16 donatists 346 augustine later works last words the last he was to speak on earth the head ready to ascend into heaven commended his members upon earth and then departed from that time you will not find christ speaking on earth he will speak indeed but it will be from heaven and then what will be the cause of his so speaking it will be because his members were being trod down upon earth to saul the persecutor he spoke from on high saul saul why persecutest thou me have ascended into heaven but still i lie upon earth here i sit on the father’s right hand but there still i hunger and thirst and go a stranger in what way then did he before ascending commend his body to us when the disciples asked him lord wilt thou show thyself at this tinfe and when shall be the mngdom of israel he an swered on the point of his departure it is not yours to know the time which the father hath set in his own power but ye shall receive the virtue of the holy spirit coming down upon you and ye shall be my witnesses see now the spreading abroad of his body the region wherein he will not have men trample on him ye shall be my witnesses in jerusalem and into all judaea and samaria and to the ends of the whole earth this is where i who now ascend shall yet lie i ascend because i am the head my body yet lies here below and where even through the whole earth take heed then lest you strike that body lest you do despite to it lest you trample upon it for those are christ’s last words on the eve of his going into heaven have in your mind’s eye a sick man lying at home in his bed wasted with illness near to death breathing hard his soul at his very lips suppose it chances that the thought of something dear to him greatly beloved comes into his mind and he calls for his heirs and says to them do this i pray you he struggles to keep the soul within him until those words are clearly spoken and confirmed and when he has so spoken his last he breathes away his life and his body is borne to the grave will not his heirs hold fast the memory of the dying man’s last words if any man should come and say to them don’t do it what will they answer not do that which my father charged me with his last breath the thing that last sounded in my ears as my father left this world however it be with any other words of his those last words bind me in a special degree for after them i never saw him or heard him speak again my brothers think as you have christian hearts if the words of a man on his way to the grave are so sweet so welcome of 17 acts 9 4 18 acts 1 6 ff homilies on i john 347 such weighty moment to his heirs what must be to the heirs of christ the last words of him who was leaving them not to return to the grave but to ascend into heaven for the man who has lived and died his soul is carried elsewhere while his body is laid in the earth it matters not to him whether those last words of his are performed or not quite other now are his doings or his sufferings either he rejoices in abraham’s bosom or in eternal fire he longs for a drop of water and his dead body lies unfeeling in the grave yet his last dying words are faithfully observed for what then can men look who pay no observance to the last words of him who sits in heaven loolang from above to see whether they be contemned or not contemned the words of him who said saul saul why persecutest thou me who lays up for judgment all that he sees his members suffer 10 and yet such men say what have we done it is we who have suffered persecution not inflicted it i unhappy men you are the persecutors persecutors above all because you have divided the church the sword of the tongue is more powerful than any blade of steel hagar sarah’s maid was proud and because of her pride she was afflicted by her mis tress that was discipline not punishment and so when she had gone away from her mistress what did the angel bid her return unto thy mistress 20 even so you carnal souls like that proud maid servant have no cause for your fury though you may for discipline’s sake have suffered some vexation return to your mistress keep the lord’s peace the gospels are set out we read of where the church extends you argue against us and call us betrayers 21 what then have we be trayed christ commends to you his church and you will not beheve him am i to believe your mahgmng of my forefathers if you would have me believe your story of betrayers do you first believe the christ which is the chiefer authority christ is god you are men which most deserves belief christ has spread his church over the whole world if it were i that said so you might disregard it but when the gospel speaks you should take heed and what says the gospel it behoved christ to suffer and rise again the third day from the dead and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name 22 where there is forgiveness of sins there is the 19 see introduction p 256 20 gen i6 4ff 21 the donatist charge against the catholics as all tainted with traditw the surrendering of the scriptures 22 luke 24 47 348 augustine later works church if you ask why it was to the church that the word was spoken i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven 23 where then is this forgiveness of sins extended throughout all nations beginning at jeru salem there is christ’s word for you to believe but you know well that if you believed christ you could have nothing to say about the betrayers and so you would have me believe your slanderings of my fathers rather than yourself believe the promises of christ 24 23 matt 16 19

vmud sinks of america general editors preface the christian church possesses in its literature an abundant and incomparable treasure but it is an inheritance that must be reclaimed by each generation the library of christian classics is designed to present in the english language and in twenty six volumes of convenient size a selection of the most indispensable christian treatises written prior to the end of the sixteenth century the practice of giving circulation to writings selected for superior worth or special interest was adopted at the beginning of christian history the canonical scriptures were themselves a selection from a much wider literature in the patristic era there began to appear a class of works of compilation often designed for ready reference in controversy of the opinions of well reputed predecessors and in the middle ages many such works were produced these medieval anthologies actually preserve some noteworthy materials from works otherwise lost in modern times with the increasing inability even of those trained in universities and theological colleges to read latin and greek texts with ease and familiarity the translation of selected portions of earlier christian literature into modern languages has become more necessary than ever while the wide range of distinguished books written in vernaculars such as english makes selection there also needful the efforts that have been made to meet this need are too numerous to be noted here but none of these collections serves the purpose of the reader who desires a library of representative treatises spanning the christian centuries as a whole most of them embrace only the age of the church fathers and some of them have long been out of print a fresh translation of a work already 10 general editors preface translated may shed much new light upon its meaning this is true even of bible translations despite the work of many experts through the centuries in some instances old translations have been adopted in this series but wherever necessary or desirable new ones have been made notes have been supplied where these were needed to explain the author’s meaning the

376 bibliography 407 index 409 preface the editor of a volume entitled augustine earlier writings would seem to be faced with the necessity in the first place of determining his terminus ad quern this is not an altogether simple matter all the extant writings are subsequent to the decisive event of his life his conversion in 386 described in books vii and viii of the confessions now the confessions were written some fourteen years after the event and many scholars have maintained that they give a highly romanticized version of what actually took place relying on works written before 391 and especially on those of the cassiciacum period they have asserted in aifaric’s words that it was to neo platonism that he was converted rather than to the gospel they have pointed out that abandonment of the world for the life of philosophic contemplation was entirely in the platonist manner and that st augustine devoted himself with a group of like nainded friends not to the study of the bible or of speci fically christian doctrines but to the discussion of general philosophic questions increasingly in the light of the enneads of plotinus of the growing influence of plotinus upon his thought alfaric has brought together an impressive mass of de tailed evidence from this point of view his ordination to the presbyterate in 391 marks the end of his early period it is true of course that there was development in st augus tine’s thought and that his ordination marks an important stage in it his call to become a minister of god’s word and sacrament necessitated a closer and more continuous study of scripture and with that would come a strengthening of his grasp on biblical truth and a profounder acquaintance with christian doctrine but that there was anything like an 3 preface 14 abandonment of philosophy in favour of theology or any easy substitution of faith in place of reason is disproved by the manifest continuity of his central ideas before and after 391 the cassiciacum dialogues must not be taken as reflecting fully his intellectual and spiritual activity during that period in part they are exercises in philosophical disputation for the training of his two young pupils but also they give clear indications of devotional exercises and scripture study going on at that time he was certainly making a careful study of the epistles of st paul in which for some time already he had been deeply interested due weight must also be given to the passage contra academ iii xix 43 in which he says no one doubts that we are impelled to learn by the twofold forces of authority and reason i have determined henceforth never to depart from the authority of christ for i find none more valid but as re gards that which must be pursued with subtle reasoning my disposition now is impatiently to long to apprehend the truth not only by faith but also with the understanding and i am confident that meantime i shall find in the platonists something that is not incompatible with our christian sacred things here his programme is announced after laying the spectre of academic doubt with the argument among others that doubt itself implies a standard of certainty he is going on to work out a system of christian philosophy in which the articles of the christian faith will be interpreted to the understanding with the aid of clues that platonism will supply before 391 this had been achieved the philosophy then arrived at was in its main features to be his for the rest of his life when he wrote the retractations only minor details were found requiring correction in the retractations st augustine himself marks the division between his early and his later writings that work is in two books of which the former reviews his writings previous to his elevation to the episcopate in 395 6 and the second begins with a review of his answers to the questions of simplicianus written at the beginning of my episcopate to this work he frequently refers later as setting forth his final understanding of the pauline doctrine of grace here if anywhere we may choose to fix the point at which the earlier gives place to the later augustine remembering that any such choice is somewhat arbitrary of the numerous works written before 395 naturally a selec tion had to be made some of them are already available in english translations and weight was given to this considera preface 15 tion in spite however of the fact that the soliloquies have been beautifully translated with notes and introduction by rose elizabeth cleveland williams and norgate london 1910 its claim to be included here seemed irresistible of the de liber o arbitrio there is an american translation but as it is not widely accessible it too is included on the other hand the absence of a translation determined the inclusion of the de natura boni in spite of its date in preference to the reply to the funda mental epistle of manes which will be found in the edinburgh translation t and t clark it has an interest of its own in the attempt there made to give scripture proofs for a meta physic essentially neoplatonist reluctantly it was decided to include none of the anti donatist works partly because the more important ones are later than 395 and are already avail able in translation but also because they represent an aspect of st augustine’s thought and work important no doubt but lying somewhat apart from the main stream of his develop ment the present selection is offered in the hope that it may give an adequate representation of the working out of the system metaphysical epistemological ethical and withal biblical which may justly be called augustinianism to the translation of each work there has been prefixed st augustine’s own review of it in the retractations and a brief introduction while to facilitate reference and to indicate the plan of the argument an analysis of each work has been given where it appeared necessary john h s burleigh university of edinburgh the soliloquies sl augustin s review of the soliloquies retractations if meantime i wrote two other books on matten touching my earnest quest for truth concerning problems whose solution was my chief desire they were written as a dialogue between my self and reason as if there were two of us present though actually i was alone to this work i gave the name soliloquies it remained unfinished in the first book the question was what kind of man he ought to be who wishes to lay hold on wisdom which is grasped by the mind and not by bodily sense and the answer was in a measure made clear at the end of the book it was concluded as the result of a logical proof that things which truly are are immortal in the second book there is a long argument about the imiiiortahty of the soul but sub ject wms not fully dealt with 2 in these books there are some things of which i do not approve i do not approve of what i said in my prayer god who wiliest not that any should know the truth but those that are pure it could be replied to this that many who are not pure know many true things it was not defined what was the truth that none but the pure could know nor indeed what knowing is and there is the sentence god whose kingdom is this whole world which sense knows not if the relative clause is to be taken as referring to god some words ought to have been added for example whom the sense of a mortal body knows not if it was meant that the world was not known by sense the world must be understood to be the future world in which there will be a new heaven and a new earth even so i should have added the words of the mortal body but at that time i was still using the word sense to express what is properly to be called bodily sense i need not repeat continually what i have just said but a.e.w 2 17 l8 augustine earlier writings it should be remembered wherever that expression occurs in my writings 3 where i have said of the father and the son that he who begets and he who is begotten is one i ought to have said are one for the truth says openly i and my father are one nor am i satisfied with the statement that when god is known in this life the soul is already happy except of course by hope again the statement not by one way only is wisdom approached does not sound well as if there were another way besides christ who said i am the way this offence to reli gious ears should have been avoided christ is the way univer sally and these are different ways of which we sing in the psalm show me thy ways o lord and teach me thy paths in the sentence these sensible things are to be utterly avoided care should have been taken to avoid being thought to hold the opinion of the false philosopher porphyry who said everything corporeal is to be avoided of course i did not say all sensible things but these sensible things meaning corruptible things but it would have been better to have said so sensible things which are corruptible will not exist in the new heaven and the new earth of the age to come 4 again in bk ii xx 35 i said that those who are edu cated in the liberal arts doubtless in learning them draw them out from the oblivion which has overwhelmed them or dig them out as it were i do not approve of this when even untrained persons suitably questioned are able to return correct answers about some of the arts a more credible reason is that they have according to their natural capacity the presence of the light of eternal reason hence they catch a glimpse of immutable truth the reason is nptah once knew it and have for gotten as plata.s.ns others like him have thought against their opinion i have argued in de trinitate bk xii as far as the sub ject of that work gave me occasion the soliloquies begin with the words volventi mihi multa ac varia the soliloquies introduction i n de ordine l iii 6 st augustine tells us of his habit during the sojourn at cassiciacum of lying awake in bed for half the night thinking his own thoughts undis turbed by the two young pupils for whose education he was responsible and for whose philosophical awakening the three disputations of that period were in part designed the soliloquies we may suppose represent these private meditations and show us the kind of question that he felt to be most urgent but they also reveal the manner of man he was in the crucial period be tween his conversion and his baptism in this respect they invite comparison with the confessions no doubt the soliloquies must suffer thereby the subject god and the soul is fundamentally the same but the treatment is incomparably narrower being primarily metaphysical rather than biographical nevertheless here too his spiritual history has a place the cultivation of the liberal arts here regarded more favourably than in the con fessions the reading of the hortensius with the deep impression it made upon him the influence of ambrose his ill health his abandonment of the world riches fame and wife the con scientious examination of his moral state with the claim to have progressed and the admission that temptation was not wholly overcome there is here no philosophic calm with all the neoplatonic colouring there is a quite un plotinian intensity of feeling the restless heart of the confessions that can find rest only in god this passionate religious quest really dominates the work in spite of the weary stretches of inconclusive argu ment in logical proof of the immortality of the soul which occupy so much of the second book the whole is conceived in a framework of prayer if the lengthy opening prayer made up 19 20 augustine earlier writings of phrases gathered from plotinus and from the bible may seem to be overloaded it must be regarded as his sincere and earnest confession of faith it is remarkable how little in the soliloquies had to be retracted later only one major correction had to be made viz the substitution for the platonic doctrine of reminis cence of the genuinely augustinian doctrine of divine illumination analysis book i i i introduction 2 6 prayer of invocation enumeration of the attributes perfections and gracious acts of god i spoke not what i knew but what i had gathered from many quarters and committed to memory and in which i have put such faith as i was able ii 7 v 1 1 knowledge of god a unique form of knowledge 7 i desire to know god and the soul nothing else besides but knowledge of god is unique 8 it is quite unlike sense knowledge even knowledge of one’s best friend is no ade quate analogy 9 plato and plotinus may have spoken true things about god without knowing him 10 knowledge of mathematical truth is real knowledge but 12 is also inade quate for it does not lead to beatitude the intelligible beauty of god is superior to the certain truths of mathematics vi 12 viii 15 analogy of sensual and intelligible vision 12 common vision requires a possession of sound eyes b the act of directing them towards an object so with the vision of god the mind a must have sound eyes that can look beyond temporal things they must be healed by faith hope and love 13 i it must direct its regard to the right object i.e it must have right reason which again demands faith hope and love 14 when the vision of god has been attained these three will still be required in this life but in the life to come faith becomes knowledge hope becomes pos session only love must remain and increase 15 as in the sensible world all objects to be seen must be illumined so also in the intelligible world as the sun is to the sensible world so is god to the intelligible world ix 16 xiv 26 examination of his moral state 16 he still fears pain dea th and loss of friends but claims 21 the soliloq uies to have made progress in the moral life 17 since reading the hortensius fourteen years before he has ceased to desire riches he has recently come to despise fame and marriage pleasures of the table do not entice him 18 riches fame wife might still be desirable but only as means to the cultiva tion of wisdom ig they are not desired for their own sake and therefore cannot be called cupidities 20 so with friend ships health life itself and even immortality 21 bodily pain distracts the mind and may be the chief evil but it can be endured 22 why then is wisdom withheld 23 long training is necessary just as eyes must be gradually accus tomed to look at the sun this is the function of the school disciplines 24 next day when you achieve the condi tion of finding no delight at all in earthly things in that moment you will have wisdom 25 6 proof that sensual temptation still has power over him xv 27 30 epilogue 28 truth is eternal and 29 must exist in something equally eternal whatever truly exists must exist eternally 30 augustine will ponder this and pray for power to under stand its import book ii i i the problem stated anew augustine knows that he exists lives and has intelligence and that ignorance is misery he wants to have it proved a that he will live eternally and b that he will know eternally is not dealt with in the soliloquies but in its sequel be immortalitate animae ii 2 v 8 truth and falsehood in sense knowledge 2 truth is logically indestructible but 3 the soul per ceives reality by means of the senses which are deceptive falsehood is that which appears to the percipient other than it truly is 4 if you allow that falsehood is inevitable and eternal as truth and that it can only be perceived by a sentient i.e living soul the soul is proved to be immortal 5 without a percipient there can be neither truth nor false hood and 7 on these terms there is no escape from solipsism vi 9 x 18 truth and falsehood inevitably intertwined in sense knowledge 10 the false has some resemblance to the true exemplified 22 augustine earlier writings by a classification of all kinds of resemblance 13 but the false is also unlike the true 16 resemblance may be in tended to deceive but it can also be intended harmlessly to amuse 1 7 painters sculptors artists generally try to pro duce imitations of the true 18 roscius is a real man but in order to be a true tragedian he must be a false hecuba priam or the like but we must seek an absolute truth un mixed with falsehood xi 19 xiii 24 the school disciplines teach absolute truth 19 the school disciplines are true without admixture of falsehood because they teach ordered scientific knowledge dialectic with its definitions and divisions is the norm and may be called truth itself 20 even literary studies though they deal with the falsehoods of poetry and fables deal with them in an objective way giving ordered knowledge about them 22 a quality may inhere in a subject as essence or as accident that which exists inseparably in a subject cannot exist when the subject is destroyed 23 soul being essentially life cannot admit of death though there is the depressing analogy of light which may not admit of darkness but may be removed to give place to darkness 24 the school dis ciplines are truth they exist in the mind therefore the mind is immortal xiv 25 26 further difficulties 25 the argument is over subtle 26 we have no books and friends who might have helped are absent ambrose could have solved the problem but perhaps did not even know there was a problem xv 27 xix 33 recapitulation 28 truth is indestructible 29 30 truth and falsehood resemblance and difference 31 problem of the void 32 matter form and mathematical figures 33 mathe matical figures transcend all material things which imitate them but do not fully exemplify them they are in the mind and they are eternal therefore the mind is eternal xx 34 to the end epilogue 34 phenomena of memory and forgetfulness 35 know ledge may be reminiscence at all events it has nothing to do with the senses but belongs to the mind or reason 36 the problem of the eternal life of the soul has been solved as far as possible there remains that of its eternal possession of intelligence the soliloquies the text book i i i for long i had been turning over in my mind many various thoughts for many days i had been earnestly seeking to know myself and my chief good and what evil was to be shunned suddenly someone spoke to me whether it was my self or someone else from without or from within i know not indeed to know that is my main endeavour at any rate some one let us call him reason said to me suppose you have dis covered some truth td whom will you entrust it in order that you may proceed to further thoughts augustine to my memory i suppose reason can your memory properly pre serve all your thoughts augustine that would be difficult nay impossible reason then you must write it down but what do you do when your health will not allow the labour of writ ing these thoughts must not be dictated for they require complete solitude a true i do not know what i am to do then r pray for health and for aid to attain to what you desire and write this dowm that you may become more spirited in your quest then briefly summarize your conclusions in a few short theses do not look to attract a multitude of readers this will be sufficient for the few who share your fellowship a i shall do as you say 2 o god creator of the universe give me first that i may pray aright then that i may conduct myself worthily of being heard by thee and finally that i may be set free by thee god by whom all things come into existence which by themselves would not exist who permittest not to perish even that which destroys itself who out of nothing didst create this world which the eyes of all perceive to be most beautiful who doest no evil so that existence is good because it is thy work who showest as 24 augustine earlier writings that evil is nothing to the few who take refuge in the truth by whom the universe even with its sinister aspects is perfect by whom there is no absolute disharmony because bad and good together harmonize whom everything capable of loving loves consciously or unconsciously in whom are all things yet so that thou art unharmed by the baseness malice or error of any of thy creatures who hast willed that none but the pure can know the truth father of truth of wisdom of the true'and perfect life of beatitude of the good and beautiful of the intelligible light father of our awakening and of our illumination of the sign by which we are admonished to return to thee 3 thee i invoke o god the truth in by and through whom all truths are true the wisdom in by and through whom all are wise who are wise the true and perfect life in by and through whom live all who live truly and perfectly the beati tude in by and through whom all the blessed are blessed the good and the beautiful in by and through whom all good and beautiful things have these qualities the intelligible light in by and through whom all intelligible things are illumined whose hiigdom is this whole world unknown to corporeal sen g whose kingdom gives the law also to these mundane realms from whom to be turned is to fall to whom to be turned is to rise in whom to abide is to stand fast from whom to depart is to die to whom to return is to revive in whom to dwell is to live whom no man loses unless he be deceived whom no man seeks unless he has been admonished whom no man finds unless he has been purified whom to abandon is to perish to reach out to whom is to love to see whom is true possession i invoke thee o god to whom faith calls us hope lifts us and charity unites us by whom we overcome the enemy and are delivered from utter destruction by whom we are admonished to awake by whom we distinguish good from evil and shun evil and follow ter good by whom we yield not to adversities our rightful lord whom we rightly serve by whom we learn that those things are alien which once we thought were ours and that those things are ours which once we thought were alien by whom we do not cleave to the delights and enticements of wicked men and are delivered from becoming insignificant through attention to trifles by whom our better part is not left subject to our lower part by whom death is swallowed up in victory who convertest us to thyself who divestest us of what is not that thou may est clothe us with what is who hearest and defendest us and leadest us into all truth who speakest to us all the soliloquies 25 good words and neither makest us nor allowest us to be made foolish who recallest us to the way bringest us to the door and causest it to be opened to them that knock who givest us the bread of life and causest us to thirst after that water of which having drunk we thirst no more who reprovest the world con cerning sin righteousness and judgment by whom unbelievers do not disti'ess us and we repudiate the error of those who think that souls have no merit with thee by whom we serve not the weak and beggarly elements god who purgest us and pre parest us for divine rewards come propitiously to my aid 4 in ail that i say come to my aid thou who art alone god one substance eternal and true where there is no strife no con fusion no transition no lack no death but absolute concord absolute clearness constancy plenitude life where nothing is lacking nothing redundant and where he who begets and he who is begotten are one god whom all serve and whom every good soul obeys by whose laws the heavens rotate the stars hold on their courses the sun rules the day and the moon the night and the whole world keeps the mighty constancy of things so far as sensible matter permits according to the order and recurrence of times daily light alternates with darkness monthly the moon waxes and wanes yearly there is the suc cession of spring summer autumn winter over longer periods there is the perfection of the course of the sun and in their vast circles the stars return to the place of their rising god by whose laws established for ever the unstable movement of mutable things is not permitted to be disordered but is ever reduced to apparent stability by the reins which hold in the revolving ages by whose laws the soul’s will is free and by unalterable neces sity rewards are distributed to the good and punishments to the evil god from whom all good things flow down to us and by whom all evil is warded off from us above whom is nothing outside of whom is nothing without whom is ribthing under whom in wbona and with whom are all things who hast made man in thine own image and similitude which every one acknowledges who knows himself hear me my god my lord my king my father my cause my hope my riches my honour my home my fatherland my health my light my life hear me hear me in thine own way known to but few 5 now thee only i love thee only i follow thee only i seek thee only am i ready to serve because thou alone art justly lord i desire to be under thy jurisdiction command i be seech thee as thou wilt but heal and open my ears that i may 26 augustine earlier writings hear thy voice heal and open my eyes that i may see thy beckoning drive madness from ihe that i may recognize thee tell me whither i must go that i may behold thee and i hope to do all that thou dost command receive i pray thy fugitive most clement father and lord already i have been punished enough enough have i served thine enemies whom thou hast put under thy feet enough have l been the plaything of de ceits receive me thy servant now fleeing from these tilings as they formerly received me a stranger when i was fleeing from thee i perceive i must return to thee let thy door be opened to me when i knock teach me how to come to thee i have nothing else but the will to come i know nothing save that transient dying things are to be spurned certain and eternal things to be sought after this only i know o father but how to come to thee i know not tell me show me provide for my journey if those who take refuge in thee find thee by faith give me faith if by virtue give me virtue if by knowledge give knowledge increase in me faith hope and charity o thou admirable and unequalled goodness 6 i come to thee and how to come i ask thee again for if thou dost leave a man he perishes but thou dost not for thou art the highest good which no man hath rightly sought and failed to find every man hath rightly sought to whom thou hast given the power to do so make me to seek thee father free me from error as i seek thee may nothing else substitute itself for thee if i desire nothing else but thee may i at last find thee father i beseech thee but if there be in me the desire for anything superfluous do thou thyself cleanse me and make me fit to see thee concerning the health of this my mor tal body so long as it is of some use to me or to those whom i love i leave it to thee most kind and wise father and i will pray for relief from the scourge wherewith thou dost now chasten me only i beseech thy most excellent clemency to convert me wholly to thyself to allow nothing to gainsay me as i draw near to thee and to bid me while i bear and wear this mortal body to be pure generous just and prudent a perfect lover and receiver of thy wisdom and worthy to dwell in thy most blessed kingdom amen amen ii 7 i have made my prayer to god reason wimt then do you wish to know augustine all that i have mentioned in my prayer reason briefly summarize it augustine i desire to know god and the soul r nothing more a nothing 1 a reference to his chest trouble the soliloqiuies 27 whatever r begin your quest then but first explain what manner of demonstration of god would appear to you satis fying a i do not know wha:t kind of demonstration would satisfy me for i do not think i know anything as i desire to know god r what then is your difficulty don’t you think you must first know what is a satisfying knowledge of god beyond wh chyou will make no further inquiry a certainly but i do not see how it can be defined have i ever had know ledge of anything comparable with god so that i could say i want to know god as i know that r if you do not yet know god how do you know that you know nothing similar to god a if i knew anything similar to god i would doubtless love it but i love nothing but god and the soul and i know neither r don’t you love your friends a how could i not love them seeing i love the soul r for the same reason do you love fleas and bugs a i said i loved the soul not animals r either your friends are not men or you do not love them for man is an animal and you said you did not love animals a indeed they are men and i love them not because they are animals but because they are men that is they have rational souls which i love even in robbers i can love reason in any than evto while i justly hate the man who misuses what i love i love my friends the more the better they use their rational souls or at all events the more they desire to use them well iii 8 r i agree but if anyone promised to give you a knowledge of god like the knowledge you have of alypius would not you be grateful and say it was enough a indeed i should be grateful but i should not say it was enough jff pray why a i do not know god as i know alypius but even alypius i do not know sufficiently well r i re you not shameless in wanting to know god better than you know aly pius a that does not follow in comparison with the heavenly bodies nothing is of less account than my dinner i do not know what i shall have for dinner to morrow and yet i do know in what sign of the zodiac the moon will be there is nothing shameless in that r so a sufficient knowledge of god would resemble the knowledge you have of the course of the moon a no because the latter is sense knowledge i do not know whether god or some hidden natural cause may sud denly alter the ordinance and course of the moon were that to happen all that i had assumed would be false j you 1 anima soul is also the life principle of animate beings animals 28 augustine earlier writings believe that might happen a no i don’t but my question is not about what i beueve but about what i know possibly we may be rightly said to believe everything we know but not to know what we only believe j in this matter then you re ject entirely the testimony of the senses a entirely i2 well now take your friend alypius whom you have just said you do not know sufficiently do you wish to know him by ense know ledge or by intellectual knowledge a what i know of him by sense knowledge if it can be called knowledge is insig nificant and yet sufficient so far as it goes but i desire to reach by intellect a knowledge of that part of him namely his mind where he is truly my friend i can he be known otherwise 4 by no means r do you dare to say that your most familiar friend is unknown to you a there is no daring about it i think that law of friendship is most just which lays down that a man shall love his friend as himself neither less nor more so seeing that i do not know myself how can i be re proached for saying that i do not know him especially since i dare say he does not profess to know himself either r if the knowledge you seek is of the kind which is attained by the intellect alone you had no right when i said it was shameless of you to seek to know god while professing ignorance of aly pius to offer the analogy of your dinner and the moon for these things as you say belong to the world of the senses iv 9 but no matter answer me this if the statements of plato and plotinus concerning god are true would you be satisfied to know god as they knew him a even if their statements are true it does not necessarily follow that they knew him many speak at gfeat length of things they do not know just as i said i desire to know all the things i mentioned in my prayer i could not desire to know what i already knew how then was i able to speak of these things i spoke not that which i under stood with my mind but that which i have gathered from many quarters and committed to memory and in which i have put such faith as i was able to kndwts quite another matter r tell me this you know what a line is in geometry a yes that i clearly know r in saying so you are not afraid of the academics a not at all they wanted to avoid philo sophical error i am no philosopher so i am not afraid to profess knowledge of the things 1 kiiow but if i reach wisdom as i desire i shall do as she directs r quite right but to return to my question you know what a line is do you also know the round object which is called a sphere a i do the soliloquies 29 r every point on the circumference is equidistant from the centre a exactly i have you gained this knowledge by the senses or by the intellect a in this matter i have found the senses to be like a ship they brought me to my destinatioiij but when i dismissed them and began to think about these things in my mind i was still as one on the high seas and my footsteps long faltered it seems to me one might more readily sail on dry land than learn geometry by the senses and yet they seem to be of some use to beginners r you do not doubt then that whatever you hsve learned of these things is to be called jk owledge a the stoics would not permit me for they atmbiite knowledge to none but the sage i do not deny that i have such perception of these matters as they concede even to fools but i have no fear of the stoics certainly i have knowledge of those things about which you asked me go on and let me see the purpose of your questioning r there is no need for haste we are at leisure just be careful to make no rash concessions i am trying to give you confidence in matters in which you need fear no fall and as if that were a small business you bid me hasten on a may god do as you say ask as you see fit and rebuke me more severely if i become impatient again 10 r it is manifest to you then that a line cannot by any possibility be divided lengthwise a it is r but across a it is infinitely divisible r similarly it is clear that a sphere cannot have more than one point from which circles may be drawn a quite so r are lines and spheres the same or do they differ a obviously they differ very much jr if they differ very much as you say and yet you know both of them equally the knowledge remains the same even if its objects differ a no one denied that r oh yes you did a moment ago when i asked what kind of knowledge of god would satisfy you you replied that you could not explain it because you had grasped nothing as you desired to know god that you knew nothing comparable to god now does the line resemble the sphere a who would say such a thing r my question was not waait you know but aow you know have you any knowledge that resembles knowledge of god your know ledge of the fine and the sphere is the same knowledge though its objects differ tell me would you be satisfied to know god as you know the mathematical sphere that is to have no more doubt in the one case than in the other v 1 1 a you press me hard and almost convince me but i 30 augustine earlier writings dare not say that i wish to know god as i know these things not only the things but the knowledge too seem to me to be different first because the line and the sphere do not differ so much that knowledge of them cannot be contained within the framework of one science now no geometer ever professed to teach about god secondly if knowledge of god were the same as knowledge of mathematical figures i would rejoice as much in the knowledge of them as i expect to rejoice when i come to know god but in comparison with the latter i despise the former so much that it sometimes seems to me that all these things would perish from my mind if i should come to know him and to see him in the manner in which he can be seen even now compared to love of him these things hardly enter my mind r granted that you would rejoice more in the knowledge of god than in the knowledge of these things the difference would be due to the objects known not to the know ing no doubt looking at a serene sky gives you much greater pleasure than looking at the earth yet the seeing would be the same if you were asked whether you were as certain of your seeing the earth as of your seeing the sky i believe you would have to reply unless your eyes were at fault that you were just as certain even though you had greater pleasure in the beauty and lustre of the heaven a i confess your similitude affects me and i am induced to assent up to a point as the sky is superior to the earth in its peculiar beauty so is the intelligible beauty of god superior to the certain truths of mathematics vi 12 i you do well to be so affected for reason who speaks with you promises to let you see god with your mind as the sun is seen with the eye the mind has as it were eyes of its own analogous to the soufs senses the certain truths of the sciences are analogous to the objects which the sun’s rays make visible such as the earth and earthly things and it is god him self who illumines all i reason am in minds as the power of looking is in the eyes having eyes is not the same thing as looking and looking is not the same as seeing the soul there fore needs three things eyes which it can use aright looking and seeing the eye of the mind is healthy when it is pure from every taint of the body that is when it is remote and purged from desire of mortal things and this faith alone can give in the first place it is impossible to show god to a mind vitiated and sick only the healthy mind can see him but if the mind does not believe that only thus wiu it attain vision it wiu not the soliloq uies 3i seek healing even if it believes that this is true and that only so will it attain the vision but at the same time despairs of healing will it not abandon the quest and refuse to obey the precepts of the physician a most assuredly especially be cause its disease must have sharp remedies r so to faith must be added hope a that i believe r suppose it be lieves all this is true and hopes that healing is possible but does not love and desire the promised light and thinks it must mean time be content with its darkness which through habit has become pleasant will it not no less spurn the physician a perfectly true r therefore a third thing is necessary love 4 there is nothing more necessary r without these three no soul is healed so that it may see that is know god 13 when its eyes are healed what next a it must look r yes reason is the power of the soul to look but it does not follow that every one who looks sees right and perfect looking which leads to vision is called virtue for virtue is right and perfect reason but even looking cannot turn eyes already healed to the light unless these three things are present faith that believes that the object to which our looking ought to be directed can when seen make us blessed hope which is assured that vision will follow right looking love which longs to see and to enjoy then looking is followed by the vision of god its true end in the sense that there is nothing more to look for this truly is perfect virtue reason achieving its end which is the happy life this vision is knowledge compounded of the knower and that which is known just as vision in the ordinary sense is compounded of the sense of sight and the sensible ob ject of w hich if either is lacking there is no seeing vii 14 now let us see whether these three things are still necessary when the soul has attained the vision that is the knowledge of god why should faith be necessary when vision is already attained and hope too when that which was hoped for is grasped from love alone nothing can be taken away but rather much must be added for when the soul sees that unique and true beauty it wull love it more unless it fix its eye upon it with strong love and never leave off looking towards it it will not be able to abide in that most blessed vision but while the soul inhabits this mortal body even if it fully sees that is knows god the bodily senses perform their proper functions they may not have power to lead astray but at least they can make things difficult faith may be called that which resists the senses and believes that the world of the mind is better again in this 32 augustine earlier writings life though the soul may be blessed by the knowledge of god nevertheless it has to bear many bodily troubles it must hope that all these disadvantages will cease after death in this life hope never departs from the soul but when after this life the soul gives itself wholly to god love remains to hold it fast faith cannot be said to be where truth is assailed by no falsehood nothing is left to hope for when everything is securely pos sessed there are three stages in the soul’s progress healing looking seeing likewise there are three virtues faith hope love for healing and looking faith and hope are always neces sary for seeing all three are necessatry in this life but in the life to come love only viii 15 now listen while i teach you something concerning god from the analogy of sensible things so far as the present time demands god of course belongs to the realm of intel ligible things and so do these mathematical symbols though there is a great difference similarly the earth and light are visible but the earth cannot be seen unless it is illumined any one who knows the mathematical symbols admits that they are true without the shadow of a doubt but he must also believe that they cannot be known unless they are illumined by some thing else corresponding to the sun about this corporeal sun notice three things it exists it shines it illumines so in know ing the hidden god you must observe three things he exists he is known he causes other things to be known i am ventur ing to teach you how to know god and yourself but how will you take what i say as probable or as true a as probable assuredly but i must confess i am aroused to a greater hope i know that what you have said about the line and the sphere is true but i would not dare to say of any of your other state ments that i know it i that is not surprising for nothing has been expounded hitherto which demands comprehension ix 16 but now let us get on without delay and let us begin with the first question of all whether we are healed and sound a that we shall discover by investigating your inward state or mine do you ask and i shall give my opinions in reply jr is there anything you love besides knowledge of yours and of god a i could of course reply that in my present mood there is nothing that i love more but it would be safer to say that i do not know my experience has been tliat often when i supposed that nothing could move me something has come into my mind which has affected me more than i imagined it may not have completely drawn me away from my thoughts the soliloq uies 33 but in fact it has interrupted them more than i supposed it would seem that i can be affected by three things chiefly fear of losing my friends fear of pain and fear of death r so you love your health your own life in the body and to be sur rounded by your friends otherwise you would not dread the loss of these things a i confess that is so i so your mind is somewhat disturbed because all your friends are not here with you and because your health is not very good that is the point a you are right i cannot deny it i2 if you were suddenly to become sound and well and to see all your friends around you enjoying peace and cultured leisure you wuuld be transported with joy a yes to some extent and if it all happened suddenly as you put it how could i contain myself how could i be expected to dissimulate transports of joy i so up till now you are agitated by the well known diseases and perturbations of the mind what impudence for such eyes to wish to see the sun of the intellectual realm a you have jumped to conclusions as if i did not feel that i had made any moral progress that some temptations had lost their power and that some resistance had been offered ask about this x 17 r don’t you see that corporeal eyes even when sound are often smitten by the light of the sun and have to be averted and find refuge in darkness why then do you speak of progress and not only of what you wish to see nevertheless let us discuss the progress we think we have made do y ou desire riches a no not for a long time i am now in rny mrty third year nearly fourteen years ago i ceased to desire riches and if perchance they came my way i cared for no more tham a necessary livelihood enough to support a life of culture one book of cicero’s easily and completely persuaded me tha.t riches were not to be sought and that if they were acquired they were to be used wisely and cautiously i2 what about honours i confess that only recently in these last few days i have ceased to desire them r what about marriage would you not like to have a wife who was beautiful chaste obedient educated or at least whom you could easily teach bringing enough dowry though you despise wealth at least to keep her from being a burden on your leisure especially if you are pr ty certain that she will not cause you any trouble a paint her virtues as you will and heap up good qualities nevertheless i nave decided that there is nothing i mxist more carefully avoid than the marriage bed i find there is nothing which more certainly casts a man’s mind out of its citadel than female blandishments a.e w 3 34 augustine earlier writings and bodily contacts which are essential to marriage so if it is part of the duty of the sage which i have not yet learned to have children anyone who has intercourse with a woman for this purpose only seems to me worthy of admiration rather than of imitation the danger of attempting it is greater than the happiness of achieving it accordingly in the interests of righteousness and the liberty of my soul i have made it my rule not to desire or seek or marry a wife r i am not now asking about your resolutions but whether you are still strug gling with lust or have already overcome it the question has to do with the soundness of your spiritual eyes a i am com pletely free from desires of this kind and i recall them with horror and disdain what more need i say this virtue in creases in me day by day the more my hope increases of be holding that spiritual beauty for which i long so eagerly the more does all my love and pleasure turn to it r what about the pleasures of the table how much thought do you give to them a foods which i have determined not to touch attract me not at all but i confess that those which i have not banned do indeed delight me when they are available but i can see them removed even when i have tasted them without any emotion when they are not to hand no longing for them in sinuates itself to disturb my thoughts do not trouble to ask me any more about food or drink or baths or any other bodily pleasure i desire only so much of them as contributes to my health xi 1 8 r you have made good progress but the vices which remain still greatly hinder you from seeing the light i am attempting an argument that can apparently prove either that nothing remains for us to conquer or that we have made no progress at all and that the corruption of our vices which we thought to have removed is still with us suppose you were persuaded that you could not live in the pursuit of wisdom with your numerous friends unless you had an ample private fortune to supply your needs would you not desire and choose riches a i might r suppose it appeared that you would persuade many to seek wisdom if your authority were increased by having honours showered upon you and that your friends could not moderate their cupidities and turn wholly to seek god unless they themsfelves received honour and could do so only as a result of your having honour and dignity would not honours be desirable and the obtaining of them a pressing concern a that is so i i do not want to introduce marriage into the soliloq uies 35 this argument for possibly it is not so relevant but suppose your wife had an ample income which could support all whom you wished to live with you in leisure and that she were willing suppose she belonged to a noble and influential family so that through her you could easily obtain the honours you admitted might be necessary i wonder whether you would consider yourself in duty bound to contemn all this a when would i venture to hope so 19 i you say that as if i were asking about your hopes i am not asking about what gives no pleasure simply because it is beyond your reach but about what gives pleasure when offered to you a spent pestilence is a very different thing from one that is merely quiescent the dictum of certain learned men is in point here all fools are mad just as dung stinks you don’t smell it all the time but only when you move it there is a vast difference between smothering cupidity with despair and driving it out of a sound mind a although i cannot answer you you will never persuade me in my present state of mind to believe that i have made no progress r i suppose the reason is that you think that while you might conceivably desire these things it would not be on their own account they were to be sought but on account of something else a that is what i wanted to say when i desired riches i desired them that i might be a rich man and when i wanted honours desire for which i have but recently overcome as i said it w as because i was delighted with their lustre i never expected anything from marriage but to obtain pleasure respectably in those days i quite simply wanted those things now i utterly spurn them but if there is no other wuy of obtaining what i now desire i would not seek them as things to be enjoyed i would undergo them as things i must endure r quite right i agree that cupidity is not the right name for desire for something that is wanted on account of something else xii 20 but why i ask do you wish your friends to live and to live with you a that with one mind we may together seek knowledge of our souls and god for in this way if one makes a discovery he can without trouble bring the others to see it r but if they are unwilling to inquire a i shall persuade them to be willing r but if you cannot persuade them be cause they think they have discovered the truth already or that it cannot be discovered or are hindered by other cares and longings a we shall do the best we can r but if their presence hinders you from inquiry will you not wish and strive 36 augustine earlier writings if their attitude cannot be changed not to have them with you a i confess that is so i 2 then you desire their life and pre sence not for its own sake but in order to find out wisdom a i agree at once i 2 if your own life was a hindrance to the obtaining of wisdom would you want it to continue a no i should flee from it r if you learned that you could reach wisdom equally by continuing in the body or by leaving it would you greatly care whether you enjoyed what you love in this life or in another a if i knew that i should encounter nothing that would drive me back from the point to which i have already progressed i should not care a your reason then for fearing death now is lest you be involved in some evil which would rob you of the knowledge of god a not only lest i should be robbed of such understanding as i have reached but also lest retaining what i myself possess i should be pre cluded from the society of those whom i eagerly desire to share it i so you do not wish for continued life on its own account but on account of wisdom a that is so 21 r there remains only bodily pain to distract you a even that i do not greatly fear except that it hinders my meditations when recently i was tortured with a sharp tooth ache i could only meditate upon things i had already learned and was completely prevented from learning anything new wliich demands undivided attention still i thought if the truth were to shine into my mind either i should not feel the pain or at least i could bear it and yet although i have never suffered anything worse i reflected how much more grievous pains might come and i am compelled to agree with cornelius celsus who says that the supreme good is wisdom and the supreme evil is bodily pain the reason he gives i think not absurd for he says seeing we are composed of two parts soul and body of which the soul is the better and the body the inferior the supreme good will be the best that can happen to the superior part and the supreme evil the worst that can happen to the inferior part wisdom is the best the soul can have and pain the worst thing the body can suffer so i think we may rightly conclude that to be wise is man’s supreme good and to suffer pain his supreme evil j we shall consider that later perhaps wisdom herself towards which we struggle will persuade us otherwise but if she shows that it is true we shall hold this opinion about the supreme good and the supreme evil without any hesitation 1 a famous roman physician fior a d 50 the soliloq uies 37 xiii 22 but now what kind of man are you to be wisdom’s lover desirous of seeing and embracing her as it were without any covering garment but yet most chastely that privilege she allows only to a very few chosen lovers if you burned with love for some beautiful woman she would not rightly give herself to you if she found you loved anything else besides so that most chaste beauty wisdom will not show herself to you unless you burn for her alone a why am i then kept in unhappy sus pense and miserably tortured by being put off surely i have shown already that i love nothing else at any rate if that is not really loved which is not loved for its own sake wisdom alone i love for her own sake all else life leisure friends i wish to have or fear to lose solely on her account what bounds can be set to love of so great a beauty in which not only do i not envy others but also wish to have as many as possible along with me seeking her panting after her holding and enjoying her in the belief that they will be my friends all the more because love for her is shared by us in common 23 r such should the lovers of wisdom be such she seeks with whom intercourse is truly chaste and without defile ment not by one way is she approached each man according to his soundness and firmness takes hold of that unique and truest good there is a certain ineffable and incomprehensible light of minds ordinary light may teach us what is its power and quality some eyes are so strong and vigorous that as soon as they are opened they can look at the sun without any hesita tion for them the light is in a sense their soundness they need no teacher but only perhaps some admonition it is sufficient for them to believe to hope to love others are smitten by the very brightness that they longed to behold and are often glad to return without seeing it to their darkness to such though they may rightly be called sound it is dangerous to show what they have not yet the power to see they must first be exercised and their love deferred and nourished to their advantage first they must be shown things which do not shine by any light of their own but are rendered visible by light such as a garment a wall or the like next they must be shown things which though having no lustre of their own shine more brightly in the light but not so as to hurt the eyes such as gold silver and the like then they must be made carefully to look at ordinary fire i gf retract i iv 3 this does not sound right as if there were another way besides christ who said i am the way i ought to have avoided this offence to religious ears 38 augustine earlier writings then at the stars the moon the dawn and the gradually brightening sky so more or less speedily following the whole course or omitting some steps in it according to his ability a man will grow accustomed to light and will be able to look at the sun without hesitation and with great pleasure this is what the best teachers do with students of wisdom who do not yet have sharp vision to provide an approach to it in some kind of order is the function of good training to reach it without order demands incredible good fortune but we have written enough for to day we must be careful for your health xiv 24 one day later the conversation was resumed a prescribe for me the order you mentioned lead me whither you wish how you wish by what methods you wish lay commands upon me as severe and arduous as you like so long as to obey them is within my power and i gain assurance of reaching my desired goal i 2 there is only one prescription i can give you i know no other you must entirely flee from things of sense so long as we bear this body we must beware lest our wings are hindered by their birdlime we need sound and perfect wings if we are to fly from this darkness to yonder light which does not deign to manifest itself to men shut up in a cave unless they can escape leaving sensible things broken and dissolved when you achieve the condition of finding no delight at all in earthly things in that moment believe me at that point of time you will see what you desire a when pray will that be i do not think i can ever reach complete contempt for earthly things unless i see something compared with which they become sordid 25 i in the same way the bodily eye might say i shall not love darkness when i can look on the sun there seems to be a kind of orderliness in that though in fact there is none the eye loves darkness because it is not strong and unless it be strong it cannot see the sun so the mind is often deceived thinks itself sound and gives itself airs because it cannot yet see it complains as if it had the right to do so but the supreme beauty knows when to show itself it performs the function of the physician and knows who are whole better than those who are being healed when we have emerged a little from darkness we think we see but cannot imagine or perceive how deeply we had been sunk or how far we have progressed comparing our condition with graver forms of disease we believe we are healed do you remember how yesterday in complete assurance we declared that we were free from disease that we loved nothing the soliloquies 39 but wisdom all else we sought and desired only for the sake of wisdom how sordid how base how execrable how horrible the embrace of a woman seemed to you when we were discus sing the desire for marriage but as you lay awake last night and the same question arose you found it was very different with you than you had supposed imagined fondlings and bitter sweetness tickled your fancy much less than formerly of course but far more than you had supposed in that way the mysterious physician was teaching you two things how you can evade his care and what remains to be cured 26 a oh be silent be silent i beseech you why do you torture me why do you cut so deep i am not too hardened for weeping now i promise nothing 1 presume nothing do not ask me about these things you say that he wdiom i burn to see knows when i am healed let him do what he pleases let him show himself when he pleases i commit myself wholly to his care and clemency once for all i have accepted the belief that he will not cease to aid those who have set their affections on him i shall never again say anything about my healing until i see spiritual beauty do as you say but restrain your tears and brace your mind you have wept much and that is not good for your chest trouble a you wish me to set a limit to my tears though i see no limit to my misery you bid me consider my bodily health when i am myself consumed with wasting but i pray you if you do anything for me try to lead me by some short cut to a place near to that light where if i have made any progress i may be able to bear it so that i may be reluctant to go back to the darkness which i have left if indeed i may be said to have left it and which soothes my blindness xv 27 i let us conclude if you please this first book so that in a second book we may start on a suitable path if we can find one for we must give you in your frame of mind some moderate exercise a i shall not allow this book to be con cluded unless you give me a glimpse of what i am seeking if it be only of something near the light m i see the physician is treating you in his accustomed way some brightness touches me and invites me along a way in which i may lead you so listen carefully a lead on and take me where you wish jr you say you want to know the soul and god 4 that is my whole enterprise i nothing more a nothing what ever m well you want to know truth a as if i could know anything without that i therefore that must be first 40 augustine earlier writings known by which other things are known a i agree i first let us ask this question there are two words veritas and verum do you think they signify two things or only one a two things evidently for just as castitas is one thing and castum another and so with many other similar pairs of words so i believe truth is one thing and that which is said to be true is another r which of the two do you think is more excellent a truth i think what is chaste is a particular instance of chastity similarly what is true is a particular instance of truth 28 r when a chaste person dies chastity has not died too a by no means r therefore when something that is true perishes truth does not perish a i do not see how any thing that is true can perish r i am surprised at that don’t you see thousands of things perishing before our eyes can you imagine that this tree is a tree but is not true or that it cannot perish though you do not trust the senses and can reply that you do not know whether it is a tree at least you will not deny i suppose that it is truly a tree if it is a tree for that is a judg ment not of the senses but of the intelligence if it is a false tree it is not a tree but if it is a tree it is true necessarily a i admit that r don’t you admit also that a tree belongs to the class of things that are born and die a i cannot deny it jr the conclusion then is that something that is true perishes a i do not contradict r you see then that when true things perish truth does not perish just as chastity does not die when a chaste person dies a now i agree and expectantly await the development of your argument r well listen a i am all agog 29 i do you think the statement is true whatever is must be somewhere a of that i am as sure as of anything r truth exists a i agree r then we must ask where it exists for it cannot be in space unless you think that something which is not a material body can be in space or that truth itself is a corporeal thing a i hold neither of these views i where then can it exist for if we admit it exists it must exist somewhere a if i knew where it exists i should prob ably have no further questions to ask r at least you can know where it does not exist a if you tell me i might j certainly it does not exist in mortal things whatever is cannot be permanent if that in which it exists is not permanent a moment ago we agreed that truth remains even when true things perish truth therefore does not exist in mortal things the soliloquies 4i but it must exist somewhere there are therefore immortal things but nothing is true in which truth does not exist therefore only immortal things are true a false tree is no tree a false log is no log false silver is not silver universally what is false is not all that is not true is false therefore nothing m'hich is not immortal can be said truly to be consider dili gently in your own mind this little piece of reasoning and see whether tlisre is any mistake in it if it holds we have nearly finished our job this will perhaps become more apparent in the next book 30 a i am most grateful and i shall diligently and carefully ponder these things with you in the silence of my own heart if no darkness come upon me to charm me as i greatly fear it may r believe steadfastly in god and commit yourself wholly to him as far as you are able do not seek to be your own and under your own jurisdiction but profess yourself the servant of the most clement lord whom it is most advantageous to serve he will not cease to lift you up to himself and will per mit nothing to happen to you that will not profit you even when you know it not i understand i believe and to the limit of my power i shall obey i earnestly ask him to increase my power do you want anything more of me r enough for the present when you have seen him you will do what he prescribes book ii i i augicstine we have sufficiently rested from our labours love is impatient and there is no emit to tears until love is given what it loves let us then begin the second book reason let us begin a let us believe in god r surely if we can god gives us power r pray then as briefly and as per fectly as you can a o god who art ever the same let me know myself and thee that is my prayer r you w ho wish to know yourself do you know that you exist a i do if how do you know a lhat i do not know r do you per ceive yourself to be simple or compounded l i do not know r you know that you have motion a no i don t r you know that you think a i do r then it is true that you think a it is true r do you know that you are immortal a no r of all those things which you say you do not know which would you prefer to know a weiether i am immortal j so you love to live 4 i admit i do r will it satisfy you to learn that you are immortal 4 it will be a great matter but 42 augustine earlier writings not sufficient r though it be not sufficient how much will you rejoice in that knowledge a great deal r you will not weep any more a no r but if you discover that even immortal life will not enable you to know more than you already know will you refrain from tears a i shall weep as if that were no life at all r so you love life not for the sake of living but for the sake of knowing a i accept that conclusion r but if knowledge itself made you unhappy a i cannot believe that possible but if it is so no man can be happy my unhappiness has no other source than my ignorance if know ledge makes a man unhappy then misery is eternal r now i see all that you desire since you believe that know ledge makes no one unhappy it follows that probably intel ligence makes a man happy no one is happy unless he has life and no one lives who does not exist you want to be to live and to know but to be in order to live and to live in order to know you know that you exist and live and have intelligence but you wish to know whether you will always have being life and intelligence or none of them whether some of them will endure eternally while others perish or if all remain whether they will be diminished or increased a that is so r l we prove that we shall live eternally it will follow that we shall exist eternally a it will r there will remain only the question of our knowing eternally ii 2 a the order is clear and short r listen and answer my questions cautiously and firmly a i am your man r if the world is to endure for ever it is true to say the world will endure for ever a none can doubt it r if it will not endure it is similarly true that it will not endure a i agree r if it has perished assuming it is to perish it will then be true to say that the world has perished for so long as that is not true the world has not perished the statement the world has perished contradicts the statement it is not true that the world has perished a this too i accept r well now do you think anything can be true if truth ceases to exist a by no means r therefore truth will exist even if the world perishes a i cannot deny it r if truth itself per ishes it will be true that truth has perished a who denies it r but nothing can be true if there is no truth a i have adrnitted that a moment ago r truth therefore can never perish a go on as you have begun for nothing is more true than that conclusion iii 3 r i should like you to tell me whether you think the the soliloq uies 43 senses belong to the soul or to the body a to the soul i think i and intelligence belongs to the soul i certainly i to the soul alone or to anything else a i see nothing besides the soul except god where intelligence may be sup posed to reside r now let us look into that if anyone said to you that that object is not a wall but a tree what would you think a either that his sight or mine was at fault or that hree was his word for wall r suppose to him there appeared to be a tree and to you a wall gould not both be true a by no means for one and the same thing cannot be both a tree and a wall if each of us sees differently one or other of us must have a false image r if there was neither a tree nor a wail both of you would be wrong a that is possible r that possibility you neglected just now d i confess i did r if you recognize that a thing appears to you other than it is are you deceived a no r it is possible then for an appearance to be false while he to whom it appears is not de ceived a it is possible i we must confess therefore that a man is deceived not when he sees falsely but when he assents to what is false a clearly we must r how would you define falsehood a that is false which is other than it seems i if then there is no one to be taken in there is no falsehood a it follows i there is then no falsity in things but only in our senses but no one is deceived who does not assent to what is false our conclusion is that we must make a distinction be tween ourselves and our senses if indeed our senses may be deceived while w e can be free from deception a i have nothing to urge to the contrary r but if y our soul is deceived you will not venture to deny that you are false a how could i r but there are no senses without a soul and no falsity without senses hence either the soul works alone or co operates with falsity a the argument compels assent 4 j now tell me whether you think there can ever be a time when falsity is no more a how could i think so when there is such difficulty in finding the truth it would be more absurd to say that falsity can cease to be than that truth should cease r do you think that a man who does not live can use the senses a it cannot be i then it is proved that the soul is immortal a you make my heart glad too quickly step by step i beseech you r and yet if the argument has been cor rect i see no reason to doubt the conclusion 4 go too quickly i say i should be more readily induced to judge that i have been rash in my admissions than to be sure of the 44 augustine earlier writings immortality of the soul elucidate your conclusion and show me how it has been reached r you said that falsity cannot be without the senses and that it cannot cease to be therefore the senses are eternal but there are no senses without a soul hence the soul is eternal moreover there are no senses without life therefore the soul lives eternally iv 5 a a blunt weapon you could as soon co nclude that man is immortal if i agreed that the world could not exist with out man and that the world is eternal r you are very watch ful yet it is no small result to have ascertained that the world cannot be without the soul if we cannot admit the possibility of there being no falsity in the world a that follows i agree but i think we must consider more fully whether some of our earlier admissions are not shaky i see that a considerable step has been taken towards proving the immortality of the soul r are you satisfied that you have conceded nothing rashly a yes i see no reason to accuse myself of rashness r then it is proved that the world cannot exist without the living soul a that may mean only that when some die others are born i2 if falsity is banished from the universe that means that all things become true a i see it follows i2 tell me how you think that wall is a true wall a because i am not mistaken when i look at it r because it is what it seems a for that reason too r if a thing is false because it seems different from what it is and true because it is what it seems take away the percipient and it is neither true nor false but if there is no falsity in the universe all things are true and noth ing can be perceived except by a living soul the soul is there fore eternal whether falsity can be abolished or not a i see that our conclusion was pretty strong and we have not moved forward by this additional argument nevertheless my chief difficulty remains souls are born and die and the fact that there are always souls in the world is due not to their immor tality but to their succession 6 i2 do you think that any corporeal things i.e objects of the senses can be comprehended by the intellect a i do not i 2 do you think god uses senses to know things a i do not venture to make any rash assertion in such a matter but so far as i may guess god does not make use of senses i2 we draw the conclusion therefore that the soul alone has senses a provisionally that is probable ij well now you agree that if that wall is not a true wall it is not a wall a that is quite simple i nor is anything a corporeal object unless it is the soliloquies 45 truly such a equally simple i now if nothing is trae unless it is what it seems and no bodily object can be seen except by the senses and the soul alone has senses and there is no corporeal object unless it is truly such it follows that there cannot be a corporeal object unless there is a soul a you press me hard and i cannot resist your argument v 7 r cive your closest attention to this a i am ready r here is a stone truly a stone if it is what it seems it is not a stone if it is not a true stone and it cannot be seen except by the senses a well r there are therefore no stones hid den deep in the earth where there is no one to see them that would not be a stone unless we were looking at it nor will it be a stone when we depart and there is no one else here to see it if you completely seal up a room containing many objects there will be nothing there that log will not be composed of wood throughout for the inside of an opaque body escapes the senses and therefore cannot exist if it existed it would be tme what is true is what it appears to be but this does not appear to any one therefore it is not true have you any reply to this a the conclusion seems to spring from what i have admitted but it is equally absurd to deny anything i have said as to concede that the conclusion is correct r i do not dispute it but what would you prefer to say bodily objects can be seen apart from the senses or there can be sense apart from the soul or a stone or any other object can exist without being time or we must find another definition of what is true a let us examine the last alternative 8 r give a definition of truth a truth is that which is as it seems to him who knows it if he will and can know it r then that will not be true which no one can know if that is false which seems otherwise than it is what happens if this seems to one man to be a stone and to another a piece of wood can the same thing be both false and true a what interests me more is how a thing that cannot be known can yet be not true i do not so much care whether one thing can be at the same time both true and false for i see that one thing may be compared with several things and may be both greater and smaller at the same time so it happens that nothing in itself is either greater or smaller these words apply when comparisons are made r but if you say that nothing is true in itself are you not afraid of the consequence that nothing is in itself the existence of this piece of wood and the truth about it come from the same source it can neither be nor be true by itself without augustine earlier writings 46 someone to know it a that is why i define in this way and do not fear that my definition should be disapproved because it is too short for that which is seems to me to be true r then if whatever is is true there will be nothing false a you have put me into great difficulty and i do not know what to answer so though i do not wish to learn by any other method than this of question and answer nevertheless i am afraid to be questioned vi 9 i god to whom we have committed ourselves will doubtless lend his aid and deliver us from these difficulties only let us believe and ask him with the greatest devotion a certainly i would do nothing more willingly at this point for nowhere have i experienced such darkness god our father who dost bid us pray and givest what we ask of thee if only we are better and live better lives as we pray hear me as i grope in this darkness and stretch out to me thy right hand cause thy light to shine upon me recall me from error led by thee may i return to myself and to thee amen r give me your utmost attention listen and watch a has anything occurred to you which can save us r listen a i am doing nothing else 10 r first let us ventilate the problem of falsity a i wonder if falsity will be found to be anything else than what is not as it seems r listen rather and let us first interrogate our senses what the eyes see is not said to be false unless it has some resemblance to the truth for example a man seen in a dream is not a true man but a false one just because there is resem blance to the truth no one would say of a dog seen in a dream that it was a man it is a false dog because it resembles a real dog a it is as you say r if any one in his waking hours saw a horse and thought he saw a man he would be deceived because he seemed to see something resembling a man for if nothing appeared to him but the shape of a horse he could not suppose that he had seen a man a quite so i2 painted tree a face in a mirror the motion of towers as seen by navi gators the broken oar in water all these things we say are false for no other reason than that they have some resemblance to truth a i agree r so we are deceived about twins about eggs about different seals stamped with one signet ring and about other similar things a i follow you and agree entirely i2 as regards visible things it is resemblance that is the mother of falsity a i cannot deny it 11 j unless i am mistaken this whole thicket can be divided into two classes in the one the resemblance is between the soliloc uies 47 equals in the other not so in the first class are those cases where we can say of both equally that the one resembles the other in the case of twins for example or the impressions of a signet ring in the other class are those cases where we can say that an inferior thing resembles a better who on seeing his face in a mirror would say that he resembled that image and not rather that it resembled him again this class is divided into two cases which belong to the soul’s experience and those which belong to objects seen those which belong to the experi ence of the soul are due either to the senses as for example the false movement of a tower or to what has been originally re ceived from the senses like the visions of dreamers and possibly of madmen furthermore of resemblances in visible things some are brought about by nature others by living creatures nature causes inferior resemblances by begetting or by reflec tion by begetting as when parents have children who resemble them by reflecting as from any kind of mirror no doubt men make mirrors but they do not make the images which mirrors reflect living creatures make pictures and similar works of imagination and here may be included the figments of demons if such exist shadows of bodies which closely resemble bodies and may be called false bodies it is not the function of the eyes to decide these may be put in the class of resemblances naturally caused by reflection in any case every body exposed to light throws a shadow on the side opposite to the light have you anything to say against all this a nothing but i am eagerly waiting to hear whither all this tends 12 i we must be patient until the other senses report also that falsity resides in verisimilitude take hearing there again there are almost as many classes of resemblance for example we hear a voice but do not see the speaker and think it is some one else whose voice resembles the one we hear of the inferior type of resemblance the echo is a witness or a ringing in the ears or the imitation of the merle or the raven that we hear in clocks or even those sounds which dreamers and madmen seem to hear it is incredible how false soft notes of which musicians speak correspond to the truth as will appear later it is suffi cient to point out now how closely they resemble true notes you follow me a yes most willingly i have no difficulty in understanding i to cut the matter short do you think it is easy to distinguish one lily from another by smelling or honey from different hives by taste or the softness of the plumage of the swan and the goose by touch a i do not j when we augustine earlier writings 48 dream that we smell or taste or touch such things are we not deceived because these images resemble the real things though in an inferior and vain way a true i so it appears that resemblances whether among equal things or unequal wheedle all our senses and deceive us or if we are not deceived because we refuse to be wheedled or because we recognize the difference we call these resemblances false just because we notice that they somehow resemble the truth a i cannot doubt it vii 13 i now listen while i repeat all this so as to make still more clear what i am trying to show you a speak as you will for i am determined to endure your circuitous course and not to weary in it so great is my hope of reaching the end of the journey i 2 well done do you think that when we see two similar eggs we can say that one of them is false a by no means if they are eggs both of them are true eggs i when we see an image reflected from a mirror how do we know that it is false a because it cannot be grasped it makes no sound it does not move of itself it is not alive and there are other in numerable signs which it would take too long to mention i i see you wish for no delay and i must adapt myself to your haste not to repeat everything if the men we see in dreams could live and speak and be grasped by us when we awake and there was no difference between them and those whom we see and address when we are awake and of a sound mind would we say that they were false a we could not correctly say so ji then if they were true so far as they were very like the truth and there was no difference at all between them and real men but were also false so far as they were proved to be unlike real men by the tests you have mentioned or by other tests must we not admit that similitude is the mother of truth and dissimilitude the mother of falsity a i have nothing i can say and i am ashamed of the rash admission i have just made 14 i it is absurd to be ashamed as if it were not for this very reason that we chose this kind of conversation as we alone take part i wish the work to be called and entitled solilo quies a new and harsh name perhaps but quite suitable to describe what we are doing there is no better way of seeking truth than by the method of question and answer but hardly anyone can be found who is not ashamed to be proved wrong and so it nearly always happens that a good discussion is spoiled by some outburst of obstinacy with fraying of tempers generally concealed but sometimes apparent now our plan was i believe the soliloquies 49 to proceed peaceably and agreeably in our searcb for truth with god’s help i was to ask the questions and you were to answer there is no need to fear if you get tied up in knots to go back and try again there is no other way out of our present difficulty viii 15 a you are right but i do not see clearly where i went wrongs perhaps it was when i said that a thing is false when it has some likeness to the true nothing else deserving to be so called occurred to me but now i am compelled to admit that false things are so called because they differ from the true accordingly unlikeness is itself the cause of falsity i am con fused for i cannot easily think of anything which has two con trary causes r perhaps this is the solitary and unique in stance in the whole world don’t you know that if you consider the innumerable species of animals the crocodile alone moves the upper jaw in eating indeed hardly can two things be found identically alike a yes i see that but when i consider what we call talse and how it is both like and unlike the true i cannot make out whether its falseness is due to the likeness or the unlikeness if to the latter there will be nothing which can not be called false for there is nothing which is not unlike something we call true if i say to the former those eggs will refute me because they are true just because they are alike besides i shall not escape being compelled to confess that every thing is false because i cannot deny that all things have a cer tain similarity but suppose i am not afraid to reply that both likeness and unlikeness together entitle a thing to be called false what way out will you give me i shall be compelled to say that all things are false because all things are partly like and partly unlike each other i should have to say that the false is simply that which is not other than it seems did i not dread those many monsters which i thought i had outdistanced again i dare not repeat that that is true which is as it seems remember ing my unexpected giddiness caused by the inference that nothing can be true without someone to know it i dread ship wreck on hidden rocks which are real even if they are unknown if i say that is true which is the conclusion will be drawn that there is no falsity anywhere deny it who will and so the storms return and i see i have made no advance with ail your un hurried patience ix 16 i 2 now listen i can never be induced to believe that we have implored divine aid in vain after all our inquiry i see that nothing remains that we may justly term false except a.e.w 4 50 augustine earlier writings that which feigns itself to be what it is not or pretends to be when it does not exist the former kind is either fallacious or mendacious fallacious strictly speaking is that which has a certain desire to deceive and this cannot be understood apart from the soul but deceit is practised partly by reason and partly by nature by reason in rational beings like men by nature in beasts like foxes what i call lying is dpne by liars the difference between the fallacious and the mendacious is that the former all wish to deceive while the latter do not all wish to do so mimes and comedies and many poems are full of lies but the aim is to delight rather than to deceive nearly all who make jokes lie but the fallacious person strictly speak ing is he whose design is to deceive those who feign without intent to deceive are mendacious or at least no one hesitates to call them liars have you any objection to urge against this 17 a please go on perhaps you have begun to teach me the truth about falsity but i am waiting to hear what you have to say about the other kind that pretends it is and is not r what do you expect i have given you many examples already don’t you think that your image in a mirror wants to be you but is false because it is not a yes i do r and every picture statue or similar work of art tries to be that on which it is modelled a i must agree r you will agree that the things which deceive dreamers and madmen are in the same class a yes these above all more than anything else these pretend to be what men see when they are awake and sane and they are false just because they pretend to be what they cannot be r why need i say more about the apparent movement of towers or the oar plunged in water or the shadows of bodies it is clear i think that they all come under this rule a most clear r i say nothing of the other senses for no one who considers the matter will fail to discover that in the realm of the senses that is called false which pretends to be something and is not x 18 a you are right but i wonder why you think poems and jests and other fallacious things are to be kept separate from this class r it is one thing to will to be false and another not to be able to be true we can classify comedies tragedies mimes and the like with the works of painters and sculptors the picture of a man though it tries to be like him cannot be a true man any more than a character in the books of the comedians these things are false not from any will or desire of their own but from the necessity of following the will of the soliloquies 5i their authors on the stage roscius wants to be a false hecuba but by nature he is a true man by so wanting he is also a true tragedian so far as he fulfils the part but he would be a false priam if he gave himself out as priam and was not but here emerges a strange fact which nobody doubts 4 what is that i in all such matters truth and falsehood are inevitably intertwined indeed if there is to be truth in one respect there must be falsehood in another how could roscius be truly a tragic actor if he refused to be a false hector andromache hercules or the like how could a picture of a horse be truly a picture if the horse were not false how could there be a man’s face in a glass true as such though not truly a man so if a cer tain kind of falsity is necessary in order that there should be truth why do we dread falsity and seek truth as a great boon a i don’t know unless it is because there is in these examples nothing worthy of our imitation after all unlike actors reflec tions in mirrors or myron’s brass cow we ought not to be both true and false true in our proper garb but false as dressed up to represent something else we ought to seek the absolute truth not that double faced thing that is partly true and partly false r you are asking something great nay divine if we find that we shall agree that we have found truth itself from which everything that is called true derives its quality a i agree most heartily xi 19 i well now do you think the art of dialectic is true or false a clearly true and so is the art of literary studies grammatica r are both equally true a i don’t see that there can be degrees of truth r yet there may be a truth that has no falsehood in it you have just said that you objected to things that cannot be true without an element of falsehood in them you know that literary studies include fables and obvious falsehoods a yes but the study of literature is not responsible for the falsehood it demonstrates their nature a fable is a false hood composed for use and pleasure while literary study is the art which guards and controls composition by its very profes sion it must handle all the products of human speech whether transmitted orally or in wtiting it does not originate these falsehoods but gives us scientific knowledge about them m quite right but i am not concerned at the moment as to whether your definition is correct i want to know whether this is properly the function of literary studies or of dialectic a i do not deny that the powder and skill to define and distinguish as i did just now belong to dialectic 52 augustine earlier writings 20 r literary study is true inasmuch as it is a school dis cipline discipline derives its name from discere to learn no one who has learnt and who retains what he has learnt can be said not to know and no one can know what is false therefore every school discipline is true a i see no rashness in accepting that reasoning i do however wonder whether any one will think that the fables are true for we learn and memorize them r surely our teacher did not want us to believe what he taught us as well as to know it a oh no what he insisted on was that we should know it r he never insisted that we should believe the tale of daedalus flying a never but if we did not hold the tale in memory he made our hands unable to hold anything r you do agree that there is such a fable and that such is reported of daedalus a certainly that is true r then you learned a truth when you learned that fable if on the contrary it were true that daedalus had wings and boys accepted and repeated it as merely a fictitious fable their con ception of the tale would be false for the very reason that the story they were repeating was true here is an example of what astonished us a moment ago there could not truly be a fable about the flight of daedalus unless it were false that daedalus had actually flown in the air a now i understand but where are we to go from that point r we have shown that the reasoning was not false by which we proved that a school dis cipline can be such only if it teach what is true a what has that got to do with our problem r tell me please why literature is a school discipline for that will be the answer to the question why it is true a i do not know the answer r don’t you think it could not be a discipline if there were no definitions in it no distinctions and distributions into classes and parts a now i know what you mean i cannot imagine a discipline in which there are no definitions divisions and reasonings where the nature of each thing is not set forth where each part does not receive its due attention without con fusion where anything relevant is omitted and anything irrelevant is admitted all this is the function of a so called discipline r and because it performs all these functions it is said to be true a i see that follows 21 i now to what discipline belongs a reasoned account of definitions divisions and distinctions of parts a as was said before all that is contained in the rules of dialectic r therefore literature as a true discipline is created by the same art as you have just defended against the charge of falsehood the soliloquies 53 and i may draw this conclusion not only in the case of literature but of all the disciplines for you triily said that you could think of no discipline which did not exercise the function of definition and distributioiij for this function was tlie essence of a discipline but if the disciplines are true by their very nature will anyone deny tliat it is by truth itself that all disciplines are true you have almost my entire assent but i have this difficulty we have counted dialectic among the disciplines now i think rather that it is itself the truth whence reason derives truth r most excellently said and most acutely but you do not deny i suppose that as a discipline it is true a oh no that is my point i know that it is a discipline and therefore true r it could not be a discipline unless there were definition and distribution of its subject matter a exactly r but if besides to it belongs the task of defining and dis tributing universally it would be the souce of truth in all the disciplines who will think it surprising if that by which all things are true is in and by itself the very truth a i have no difficulty in immediately accepting that statement xii 22 r then little remains to be said so listen a go on and provided i can understand i shall gladly agree ij we quite understand that one thing can be said to be in another in two ways first in such a way that it can be separated and put elsewhere e.g this piece of wood in this place or the sun in the east and second in such a way that it cannot be separated e.g the form and appearance which we see in this piece of wood or light in the sun or heat in fire or learning in a mind and such like do you agree a that is an old old story to me i had it drilled into me at the beginning of my adoles cence so i can agree without a momenf s deliberation r then that which exists inseparably in a subject cannot continue to exist if the subject itself is destroyed a that must be true for anyone who diligently considers the matter knows that even when the subject remains that which is in it may not remain the colour of the body may be changed by reason of ill liealth or age though the body itself has not perished this is not equally true in all cases but only in those cases in which the quality is not essential to the existence of the subject that wall is not a wall by reason of the colour we see now it would re main a wail even if by any chance it became black or white or othenvise changed its colour on the other hand if fire ceased to be hot it would not be fire and we cannot think of snow without whiteness 54 augustine earlier writings xiii 23 but to go back to your question who could allow or admit as a possibility that what exists in a subject could con tinue to exist when the subject itself has ceased to exist it is quite absurd and quite untrue that a thing a which can only exist in another thing b can continue to exist when b has ceased to exist r then we have found what we were seeking a what is that you tell me r exactly as you heard a is it then crystal clear that the soul is immortal i absolutely clear if all that you have admitted is true unless of course you can say that the soul exists after it is dead a i could not say that i should say that by the very fact of its dying the soul has ceased to exist nor is my opinion weakened by the statement of certain great philosophers that that which confers life by its presence cannot admit of death no doubt a light causes light wherever it shines and cannot admit of darkness according to the celebrated principle of contraries nevertheless it can be extinguished and thereby the place becomes dark that which resists darkness and can in no way admit of darkness never theless gives place to darkness by being extinguished or re moved my fear is lest in the same way death comes to the body by the removal or extinguishing of the soul so i cannot be quite sure about every kind of death there might be a prefer able kind in which the soul was safely removed from the body and brought to a place if there is such a place where it would not be extinguished if this is not possible and the soul is like a light kindled in the body and cannot continue anywhere else and death is the extinction of soul and life in the body then a man must choose as far as he may to live his present life in security and tranquillity and yet i do not know how that is to be done if the soul is mortal happy are those who know by them selves or from some other source that death is not to be feared even if the soul too dies unhappily no reasons or books have availed to persuade me of this 24 r don’t lament the human soul is immortal a how do you prove it r from what you have already ad mitted after most careful consideration a i certainly do not remember admitting anything carelessly but pray sum it all up now and let us see where we have arrived by all these round about ways i don’t want to be asked any more questions if you will now briefly outline our agreements there will be no need for me to reply why should you delay my rejoicing if in deed we have reached a good result r i shall do as i see you wish but listen diligently 1 speak now i am listening why the soliloq uies 55 do yon torment me r if a thing a existing in another thing b lasts for ever b must last for ever all scientific learning is in a subject the mind therefore if learning is eternal the mind also must be eternal moreover scholastic learning is truth and as reason persuaded us at the beginning of this book truth is eternal therefore the mind is eternal and cannot die he alone will reasonably deny that the mind is immortal who proves that some of our propositions have not been correctly agreed to xiv 25 a i want to break out into rejoicing straight away but two things cause me to hesitate in the first place i observe that we have used a circuitous route following a lengthy chain of reasoning when the whole problem could quite as easily have been demonstrated briefly as it has at last been demonstrated what makes me anxious is that our talk has wandered round and round so long as if an ambush were being laid and secondly i do not see how a scholastic discipline can be in the mind eternally especially dialectic seeing so few know it and these have had to be indoctrinated from their youth we cannot say that the minds of the unlearned are not minds or that they have learning and do not know it that would be utterly absurd it remains either that truth is not always in a mind or that scholastic discipline is not truth 26 r not in vain has our reasoning taken these circuitous ways our problem was what is truth and i see that not even as it is have we been able to investigate it thoroughly though we have tried almost every path however rough through the thicket what are we to do shall we give up the attempt and wait till some other man’s book comes into our hands and gives a satisfactory answer to our question i think that before our time many books have been written which we have not read and not to speak of what we do not know many are written in verse and prose by men whose writings cannot escape our notice and whose genius we know to be such that we cannot despair of finding in them what we want especially before our eyes there is ambrose in whom wc recognize that eloquence has perfectly come to life again which we had mourned as dead will he who by his writings has taught us the true manner of living allow us to be ignorant of the nature of living a for myself i think not and i have great hopes from that source but one thing i am sorry for that i have had no opportunity to reveal to him as i wish my assiduity towards liimself and towards wisdom for assuredly ho w ould have pity on my 56 augustine earlier writings thirst and would give me drink much more speedily than i can find it myself he is untroubled by doubt and is thoroughly persuaded as to the immortality of the soul perhaps he does not know that there are some made miserable by their ignorance of this whom it is cruel not to help especially when they seek help my friend zenobius also knows my ardour but he is far away and as i am situated at present there is hardly any chance of sending him a letter in his leisure beyohd the alps i dare say he has finished the poem by which he hoped to charm away the fear of death and to drive from his soul the numbness and cold induced by the perennial northern ice meantime until those things come which are not at present in our power it would be a shame to waste our leisure and let our whole mind depend on an uncertain judgment xv 27 where is that for which we have prayed and do pray to god not riches for ourselves or bodily pleasures or popular honours and applause but that a way may be opened to us as we seek god and the soul will he abandon us or we him r it is far from his way to abandon those who seek such things so it should be far from us to forsake so great a leader so if you please let us briefly repeat the arguments for these two propositions that truth is eternal and that the science of dialectic is truth these you said were shaky so that we could not be sure of the entire edifice we have erected or shall we rather inquire how there can be scientific learning in an un trained mind which we must none the less regard as a mind for this question seemed to disturb you and make it necessary to question what you had admitted a let us discuss the first question to begin with then we shall see what is to be made of the second in this way no controversy will remain unsettled r so be it but give me your most careful and undivided attention i know that you are too eager about the conclusion and want it to be reached immediately so that you agree to what is suggested to you without due examination a perhaps you are right i shall strive with all my might against this kind of sickness only begin and do not let us be delayed by superfluities 28 i so far as i remember we concluded that truth could not perish because if the whole world nay if truth itself perished it would still be true that the world and truth had perished but nothing is true without truth hence truth can not perish a 1 remember and i should be much surprised if this were false r let us then proceed to the second question the soliloquies 57 a give me a little time to consider in case i should have to go back again which would be a shame i it will not be true that truth has perished if not then it did not perish if it is true how after the decease of truth can anything be true for then there will be no truth a i have no need of further consideration go on to the other question we shall at least do what w e cam so that learned and understanding men may read these avords and correct any rash utterance for my self i do not think that now or ever anything can be found to urge against these conclusions 29 i2 truth is that by which anything that is true is true a certainly i nothing is said to be true except what is not false a it would be silly to doubt it i is not that false which has a certain likeness to something but is not that to which it bears a resemblance a to nothing else would i more freely give the name of false and yet that is commonly called false which is veiy unlike the true r undeniably but there is always some imitation of the true a but how when we are told that medea joined together winged serpents and sped through the air there is no imitation of what is true for the tale is not true and there can be no imitation of what does not exist r quite right but observe that a thing which does not exist cannot even be said to be false if it is false it exists if it does not exist it is not false a are we not then to say that that monstrous story about medea is false r not exactly if it is false how is it monstrous a here is a sur prising thing when i hear of huge winged serpents joined together by a yoke i am not to say it is false i2 of course you are but that implies something that exists a what exists a the statement expressed in that verse a where is there any imitation of the true in it r because it is stated as if medea had really done it a false statement is ex pressed exactly like a true one if it is not intended to be be lieved a false statement resembles a true one only in gram matical form it is simply false and has no intent to deceive if it demands belief it more obviously imitates a true statement now i understand that there is a great difference between mere statements and the objects about which statements are made now i agree for you have removed my only reason for doubting that we cannot rightly call anything false unless it imitates something that is true a man who called a stone false silver would be justly laughed at but if he were to say that a stone was silver w e should say that what he said was false that augustine earlier writings 58 is he had uttered a false statement but it would not be absurd to call tin or lead false silver for there is some resemblance the falsehood lies not in our statement but in the material objects about which it is made xvi 30 i you have understood perfectly but could we appropriately call silver by the name of false lead a i do not think so i why a i don’t know i see no reason except that i should be most unwilling to do so i possibly because silver is a more precious metal and to call it imitation lead would be insulting while to call lead imitation silver would be doing it honour so to speak a you have exactly explained my feelings i believe that men are rightly held to be infamous and incapable of bearing witness or making a will who show themselves in women’s garb i do not know whether i should rather call them false women or false men we can without hesitation call them true actors or truly infamous or if they are not found out and we cannot use the word infamous unless there is public ill fame we can at least truthfully call them truly worthless fellows i we can discuss that at another time for many things that seem base to the popular eye are clearly hon ourable when seen in the light of some laudable purpose it is a big problem whether for the sake of his country’s liberty a man may don a woman’s dress in order to deceive the enemy in this case by being a false woman he might be more truly a man and should a sage who somehow knew that his life was neces sary for the welfare of mankind prefer to die of cold rather than be clad in female garments if nothing else were available but as i said we can discuss that again at any rate you perceive how much inquiry would be necessary as to the limits of such actions to transgress which would involve a man in inexcusable baseness but so far as our present problem is concerned i think it is now clear and beyond doubt that nothing is false except by some imitation of the true xvii 31 a go on to the rest of the argument for i en tirely accept this i i ask then whether in addition to the scholastic disciplines with which must be numbered the pur suit of wisdom we can find anything so true that unlike the achilles of the theatre it is not partly true and partly false a indeed i think many things can be found the disciplines have nothing to do with that stone and yet as a true stone it imitates nothing whereby it might be said to be false this one example will show that we need name no others for innumer able things will spontaneously occur to any one who thinks the soliloq uies 59 quite so but don’t you think they could all be included in one category material objects a yes if i were sure that there is no such thing as the void if i thought that the mind was to be numbered among material things and if i believed that god too was corporeal if all this is granted i see that every thing that exists is true having no false imitation i you are sending us oat on a long discussion but i shall be as brief as i can at least what you call the void is a very different thing from the truth a very different what could be more void of sense than for me if i think truth is a void to seek so earnestly what is vain what else do i desire to find but truth jr you will allow that nothing is true which is not made to be true by truth a that has been perfectly clear for a long time i you do not doubt that there is nothing besides the void unless it be matter a i do not i2 then it appears that you think truth is a material thing a not at all i is it in a material body a i do not know but it does not matter i am sure you know that if there is a void it is where there is no material body i that is clear a why then do we delay i do you think that truth has created the void or that any thing is true where there is no truth a i do not i then the void is not true nothing can be made void by that which is not void and it is clear that nothing is true where truth is not and the void is so called because it is nothing how there fore can that be true which does not exist indeed how can that exist which is absolutely nothing a come then let us leave the void as being utterly void xviii 32 i what about the other questions 4 which jr those which you see are my chief interest i mean the soul and god if these two are true because truth is in them no one doubts concerning the immortality of god moreover the soul is believed to be immortal if truth which cannot perish is proved to be in it wherefore let us look at the final question whether material substance be not truly true that is whether there be in it not truth but only a kind of semblance of truth for if in the body which certainly perishes we find such truth as is found in the sciences the science of dialectic will not be the truth in virtue of which all the sciences are true for corporeal substance is true though it does not seem to have been formed by the rational process of dialectic if matter is true by imitation and therefore not perfectly true there will be nothing to prevent dialectic being claimed as the very truth a meantime let us inquire about matter not 6o augustine earlier writings even when this is determined do i see that controversy settled r how do you know the will of god but listen i think matter is contained in some form or outward appearance with out which it would not be matter if it had true form it would be soul am i wrong a i agree with your first proposition but about the second i am in doubt i agree that unless it were contained in some shape it would not be matter but i fail to understand how it would be soul if it had true form i2 don’t you remember speaking about geometrical figures at the begin ning of the first book a thanks for reminding me of course i remember r do you find in material objects such figures as geometry employs a oh no much inferior ones i which then of the two do you think are true a please do not think i need to be asked such a question who is so blind as not to see that the figures employed in geometry belong to the truth or that truth is in them while the figures exhibited in material objects though indeed they seem to resemble geo metrical figures somehow imitate the truth and are to that ex tent false now i understand all you were trying to show me xix 33 r there is no need then to inquire about dia lectic whether geometrical figures belong to truth or truth is in them no one doubts that they are contained in our minds so that necessarily truth is in our minds but if any scientific discipline is in the mind inseparably and truth cannot perish why pray should we doubt concerning the everlasting life of the mind because of our familiarity with death has the geo metrical line or square or circle anything else to imitate in order that it may be true a i cannot believe it unless a line is other than length without breadth and a circle is other than a line drawn round a centre and always equally distant from the centre r why then do we hesitate is there no truth in the mathematical line and circle a god avert such stupidity r is scientific learning not in the mind a who could say that r possibly that which is in a subject may con tinue when the subject itself has been destroyed a i could never be so persuaded r perhaps truth may pass away a how could that be r very well then the soul is im mortal now trust your reasonings trust truth it cries out that it dwells in you that it is immortal that it can never be forced to abandon its dwelling place by any kind of bodily death turn away from your shadow and return to your in ward self there is no death for you unless you forget that you are of such a nature that you cannot die a as i listen to you the soliloquies 6l i begin to understand and to grasp your meaning but please elucidate a question which has been left over how are science and truth to be understood to exist in a mind untrained at least if we may not call it mortal i that question would require another volume if it were to be fully treated i see you must think over the things we have investigated according to our powers for if no doubt remains concerning them i think we have done a good day’s work and can go on to investigate other problems with no little sense of security xx 34 a it is as you say and i willingly obey your be hests and yet before you bring this volume to an end i should like to ask you briefly to explain what is the difference between a true figure such as is grasped by the intelligence and one such as the imagination depicts which in greek is called a phantasy or a phantasm r none but the most pure can understand that and you have had too little practice in philo sophy to be able to see it in all these circuitous arguments we have been simply exercising your powers so that you may be come fit to see it but perhaps i may briefly explain how the vast difference may be made known suppose you have for gotten something and your friends want you to recall it to your memory they will say ts it this is it that mentioning various things of a similar kind you do not recall what you are seeking but you know that it is none of the things they have mentioned now surely what has happened is not entire oblivion for the discernment which refuses to accept a false suggestion is itself a kind of memory a seemingly r in such a case you do not yet see the truth but you are not de ceived for you have some idea of what it is you are looking for but if some one were to tell you that you smiled a few days after you were born you do not venture to say it is false if the speaker is one whom you can trust you will not remember the fact but you will believe it that whole period is buried for you in utter oblivion don’t you think so a i quite agree r this kind of forgetfulness differs greatly from the other kind we have just spoken of which has a sort of intermediate position between forgetfulness and remembering it is closer to remembering and reviving a truth a similar situation occurs when we see some thing and are quite certain we have seen it before we say that we know it but where when how in whose company it came to our notice we cannot recall without a great deal of trouble or we may meet a man and have to ask where we made his acquaintance when he reminds us the whole thing suddenly 62 augustine earlier writings comes back to our memory as if a light had been kindled and we have no further trouble in recalling it is this kind of experi ence unknown to you or strange a nothing is plainer for nothing happens to me more frequently 35 r such are those who are well educated in the liberal arts doubtless in learning them they draw them out from the oblivion 1 that has overwhelmed them or dig them out as it were they are not content until they fully behold the face of truth whose splendour glimmers even now in these liberal arts but from these arts too some false colours and shapes are reflected as it were on the mirror of the mind and often deceive inquirers into thinking that that is all they can know or look for these imaginations are to be avoided with the greatest care they are proved fallacious because they vary as the mirror of the mind varies the face of truth remains one and immutable the mind will depict a square now of this size now of tliat and present it to the eye but the inward mind which seeks to see the truth turns rather if it has the power to the ideal square by which all squareness is judged a sup posing someone says that the mind judges according to what it is accustomed to see with the eyes r how then does it judge as it will do if it is well trained that a true sphere of any size whatever will touch a true plane surface at a single point how can the eye ever see any such thing which cannot even be imagined by thought do we not prove this when we think of the smallest imaginable circle and draw lines to the centre if we draw two lines so close together that the point of a needle can hardly penetrate between them we cannot even in imagina tion draw other intermediate lines that will reach the centre without coinciding and yet reason proclaims that innumerable intermediate lines can be drawn in that incredibly narrow space and that they will not touch except at the centre indeed that between any two of them a circle can be drawn now if phantasy cannot take this in but is even more defective than the eyes which are responsible for inflicting it on the mind clearly phantasy is very different from truth and cannot see it i cp retract i iv 4 referring to this passage augustine writes i do not approve this when even untrained persons suitably questioned are able to return correct answers a more credible reason is that they have according to their capacity the presence of the light of the eternal reason hence they catch a glimpse of immutable truth the reason is not that they once knew it and have forgotten as plato and others like him have thought in his early writings augustine seems to have held the platonic doctrine of reminiscence it is rejected in be trinit xii xv 24 the soliloq uies 63 36 we shall speak of these things with greater care and subtlety when we begin to discuss the intelligence which it is our intention to do after we have discussed and solved the problem of the life of the soul as far as we are able i suspect that you rather fear that death even if it do not slay the soul nevertheless may bring oblivion of everything even of such truth as may have been discovered a i cannot express strongly enough how much this evil is to be feared what kind of eternal life would that be and what death would not be preferable if the soul so lived as we see it in a boy newly born not to mention the life lived in the womb which i suppose must be called life r be of good courage god will grant us his presence as we have experienced it in our present quest he promises us a most blessed future after this bodily life a future full of truth without any falsehood note the work is manifestly incomplete a third book of soliloquies was projected and material for it was collected while augustine was at milan after his return from cassiciacum this material is contained in the de animae immortalitate which he tells us was published without his consent and in an unfinished condi tion by reason of its brevity and the confusion of its argument it is so obscure that it is wearisome to read and my meaning is scarcely intelligible even to myself retract i v i the teacher augustine s review of the de magistro retractations f xii about the same time i wrote a book entitled de magistro in which we discuss and inquire and discover that there is no teacher who teaches man knowledge except god according to what is written in the gospel one is your teacher even christ matt 23 10 the book begins quid tibi videmur efficere mile cum loquimur the teacher introduction t he de magistro is briefly reviewed in the retractations between the de musica and the de vera religione and is said to have been written about the same time as the former i.e about 389 after augustine’s return to tagaste it is a dialogue with his natural son adeodatus who was then in his sixteenth year and who died an early death shortly after of adeodatus there is an interesting notice in the confessions ix vi 14 along with his father and alypius there was baptized by ambrose in milan on easter day 387 the boy adeodatus my son after the flesh born of my sin he was hardly fifteen years old but in intelligence he excelled many grave and learned men i acknowledge thy gifts in him o lord my god i had nothing to give to that boy except the sin which i transmitted to him thou none else didst inspire in us the thought of bringing him up in thy discipline i confess thine 64 the teacher 65 own gifts to thee there is a book of mine extant called the teacher in which he took part with me thou knowest that all the opinions there expressed by my interlocutor were actually his when he was in his sixteenth year i experienced malny other marvellous things about him his ability made me stand in awe of him who save thou can be the doer of such miracles thou didst remove his life early from this earth and i remember him with all the greater confidence as i have no reason to fear for him any sins of boyhood adolescence or manhood adeodatus was also present at the discussion on the happy life during the sojourn at cassiciacum the youngest member of the company whose ability unless parental fondness deceives me shows great promise he naturally takes but a minor part in the dialogue but his suggestion that having god means having no unclean spirit was received with approbation by monica and by augustine too who gently points out that it is equivalent to living well if it is true that the de magistro gives the actual contribution of adeodatus to the discussion his father’s admiration for his ability is fully justified as we have seen he had been brought up as a christian and we may suppose that his general educa tion had not been neglected this dialogue between father and son may well exemplify the care taken to improve his talents at all events it is in part an exercise in dialectic among its attrac tive features is the recurrence of the personal touch the play fulness here and there on both sides the father’s commendation of the son’s acuteness caution modesty and willingness to be corrected when wrong without loss of temper and the son’s obvious respect for the father combined with tenacity in argument the dialogue is an essay in epistemology how is knowledge of truth attained how are ideas communicated what part does teaching play in the process of learning the first section 1 18 is an exercise in pure dialectic to very little purpose except as an exercise as is admitted fortunately it is briefly and clearly summarized by adeodatus in a quite masterly fashion 19 20 the important part begins at x 29 with the discussion of the relation between words and reality words zre but signs important as pointing beyond themselves to reality but not by themselves imparting knowledge at most they stimulate inquiry knowledge can be gained only as a result of an internal process in the mind of the pupil all that the teacher can do by means of words is to elicit the truth truth 66 augustine earlier writings is interior to the mind and cannot be communicated from without but this does not mean that truth is subjective it comes from god whose eternal truth christ dwells in minds prepared to receive him christ is the inward teacher of all who can or will listen to him of course the things christ teaches are held to be the universal truths of reason historical events e.g the story of the three youths of daniel 3 27 are not matters of knowledge but of useful faith analysis i i iii 6 introduction 1 we use words to let others know what we are thinking to teach or remind them of something we have in mind 2 we also use words when we pray though we need not tell god anything we use them also in thinking but only to bring to mind the things they signify words are simply sig nificant signs 3 it is well nigh impossible to get behind signs to things 4 synonyms are signs too 5 so are ges tures e.g pointing to a visible object gesture signs may be elaborate e.g deaf and dumb signs and miming 6 but actions can be demonstrated without signs by merely per forming them iv 7 vi 18 words as signs signifying merely signs synonyms 7 we are first to consider signs which signify signs especially words spoken or written 8 distinction between signs and things signified signijicabilia 9 sign word name a word is an articulated spoken sign a name is a parti cular kind of word denoting a particular thing e.g river 11 word and name in the general sense not in the special sense of verb and noun are nearly synonymous 12 verbum suggesting the physical aspect nomen the mental aspect 13 any word any part of speech may be used as a noun several proofs follow 13 17 vii 19 viii 21 recapitulation estimate of the value of the exercise viii 22 ix 28 signs which signify things 22 the word homo signifies a man but is not a man 23 no hon has come out of the mouth of one who has pronounced the word 24 when the word homo is used simply the noun may be meant or an actual man 25 things signified are the teacher 67 more important than their signs because 26 the end is more important than the means so far as words are the means of communicating knowledge they are valuable but not so pre cious as the knowiedge itself 28 education is a good thing for it supplies not merely knowledge of the words virtue and vice but also knowledge of the virtues and the vices all of which is necessary for the good life x 29 xiii 45 final problem things known without signs 30 we teach by giving signs and nothing can be taught without signs and yet 32 many things e.g natural objects can be known without signs by those who have eyes to see them 33 in fact nothing is learnt from signs or words if i know the meaning of a word that word teaches me nothing new if i do not know the meaning of a word again it teaches me nothing 34 a word is only intelligible if i know by personal experience the thing it signifies otherwise it can only stimulate inquiry 37 we may know the meaning of all the words used to describe an historical event but the event itself cannot be known it can only be believed 38 know ledge is of universals and these we do not learn by means of words we must consult the eternal wisdom of god i.e christ who dwells in the inner man gives men to see the truth according to the ability of each and this ability de pends on the moral quality of the wll 39 knowledge is either sense knowledge or intellectual knowledge neither is conveyed by words the former comes by sense perception the latter by contemplation sense knowledge of things past is stored as images in the memory and cannot be communi cated except to those who have shared the experience when spoken of it may or may not be believed 40 general truths of reason are not taught but are somehow in the mind and only require to be discovered by skilful questioning they are not put in the mind of the pupil by the teacher 41 the pupil judges of what the teacher says in the light of the in ward truth 42 ff words need not even reveal the mind of the speaker there may be deception or misunderstanding 45 even if we admit that in general words do reveal the mind of the speaker do not these exceptions suggest that the correspondence of word and thought is never quite exact teachers do not profess to teach their own opinions but ob jective truth of which the pupil judges no man is really a teacher the idea that some men are teachers aris from the fact that apprehension of truth follows without appreciable 68 augustine earlier writings interval on the words of the teacher but the two processes are separable xiv 46 epilogue words simply put us on the alert and make us ready to learn knowledge comes not from outside by external means but jfrom the master who dwells within christ the truth of god the teacher a dialogue between augustine and his son adeodatus the text i i augustine wtiat do you suppose is our purpose when we use words adeodatus the answer that occurs to me at the moment is we want to let people know something or we want to learn something augustine i agree at once with the former for it is clear that when we use words we want to let somebody know something but in what way do wc show that wc wish to learn adeodatus when we ask questions of course aug even then as i understand it we want to let somebody know something do you ask a question for any other reason than to show the person questioned what you want to know ad no aug you see then that when we use words we desire nothing but to let someone know something ad not quite perhaps if speaking means using words i see that we do so when we sing now we often sing when we are alone with no one present to hear us and then i cannot think we want to tell anyone anything aug and yet i think there is a kind of teaching and a most important kind which consists in reminding people of something i believe this will be made clear as our conversation proceeds if however you do not think that we learn by remem bering or that he who reminds us of something really teaches us i do not press the point i assert that there are two reasons for our using words either to teach or to remind others or it may be ourselves and we do this also when we sing don’t you agree ai well hardly for i very rarely sing to remind myself of anything almost always simply to give myself pleasure aug i see what you mean but don’t you notice that what pleases you in singing is the melody now this can be added to the words or not added so that singing is not the same thing as 69 jo augustine earlier writings speaking flutes and harps make melody birds sing sometimes we hum a bit of music without words all these things may be called singing but not speaking do you disagree ad no not at all 2 aug you agrecj then that there is no other reason for the use of words than either to teach or to call something to mind ad i would agree were i not impressed by the fact that we use words when we pray and it is not proper to believe that we teach god anything or remind him of anything aug i dare say you do not know that we have been commanded to pray in closed chambers by which is meant our inmost mind for no other reason than that god does not seek to be reminded or taught by our speech in order that he may give us what we desire he who speaks gives by articulate sounds an external sign of what he wants but god is to be sought and prayed to in the secret place of the rational soul which is called the inner man this he wants to be his temple have you not read in the apostle know ye not that ye are the temple of god and the spirit of god dwelleth in you i cor 3 16 and that christ may dwell in the inner man eph 3 17 have you not observed in the prophet commune with your own hearts and be stricken on your beds offer the sacrifice of righteousness and hope in the lord ps 4 4 5 where do you think the sacrifice of righteousness is offered save in the temple of the mind and on the bed of the heart where sacrifice is to be offered there is prayer to be made wherefore when we pray there is no need of speech that is of articulate words except perhaps as priests use words to give a sign of what is in their minds not that god may hear but that men may hear and being put in remembrance may with some consent be brought into dependence on god what do you think ad i entirely agree aug and you are not disturbed by the fact that our great master in teaching his disciples to pray taught them certain words so that it looks as if he had taught them actually what words to use in prayer ad no that does not disturb me for he did not teach them words merely but by words by means of which they could keep themselves in constant remem brance he taught them realities what they should pray for and from whom when they prayed in their inmost mind as we said aug you have correctly understood the point and i believe you have also noticed a further point it might be con tended that though we utter no sound we nevertheless use words in thinking and therefore use speech within our minds the teacher 71 but such speech is nothing but a calling to remembrance of the realities of which the words are but the signs for the memory which retains the words and turns them over and over causes the realities to come to mind ad i understand and follow ii 3 aug we agree then that words are signs ad we do aug that alone can be a sign which signifies something ad certainly aug how many words are there in this verse si nihil ex tanta superis placet urbe relinqui if it pleases the gods that nothing be left of so great a city ad eight aug then there are eight signs ad there are aug i suppose you understand the meaning of the verse ad yes i think so aug tell me what each word signifies ad i know what si signifies but i can think of no other word to explain it aug at least you can explain the state of mind signified by that word ad it seems to me to signify doubt and doubt is found in the mind aug i accept that in the meantime go on to the next word ad mhil signifies simply what is not aug perhaps you are right but i am prevented from giving my assent by what you admitted a moment ago you agreed that only that can be a sign which signifies some thing now what is not cannot be something so the second word in the verse is not a sign because it does not signify some thing we w ere wrong therefore in laying it down that all words are signs or that all signs must signify something ad you press me sore but surely it is utterly foolish to use a word if we have no meaning to attach to it when you are speaking with me i believe that you do not utter any merely empty sound but that in everything that proceeds from your mouth you are giving me a sign by which i may understand something so you ought not in speaking to pronounce these two syllables unless by them you mean something if you see that they are necessary to set forth some idea and to teach and remind us of something when they sound in our ears you assuredly also see what i wish to say but cannot clearly explain iwg what then are we to do shall we say that the word nihil signifies a state of mind rather than a thing which is nothing the state of a mind i mean which does not see an object and discovers or thinks it has discovered nonentity ad perhaps that was what i was trying to explain aug however it may be let us go on to the next point lest something most absurd happen to us ad what do you mean aug if nothing should detain us 72 augustine earlier writings and yet we should suffer delay ad it is indeed ridiculous and yet somehow i see it can happen and indeed has happened 4 aug at the proper time we shall understand more clearly this kind of difficulty if god will now go back to the verse and do your best to unfold what the other words signify ad the third word is the preposition ex for which i think we can sub stitute de aug but i am not asking you to substitute for one well known word another equally well known word which you say means the same thing if indeed it does mean the same thing but let that pass meantime if the poet had written not ex tarda urbe but de tanta urbe and i asked what de signified you would say ex since these two words that is signs signify you think one and the same thing but i am looking for the one thing which is signified by these two signs ad i think they mean a separation of a thing a from a thing b in which it had formerly existed a is said to be of or out of b and this in one or other of two ways either b does not remain as in this verse for troy has been destroyed but some trojans could still exist or b remains as when we say that business men of the city of rome are in africa aug i shall concede your point and not seek to enumerate the many exceptions that can be found to your rule but you can at least observe that you have been explaining words by means of words that is signs by means of signs well known words and signs by words and signs also well known but i want you to show me if you can what are the things of which these are the signs iii 5 ad i am surprised that you do not know or rather that you pretend not to know that what you ask cannot be done in conversation where we cannot answer questions except by means of words you ask for things which whatever they may be are certainly not words and yet you too use words in asking me first put your questions without using words and i shall reply on the same terms aug i admit your challenge is just but if i were to ask what was signified when these three syllables par 4 es are pronounced couldn’t you point with your finger so that i should immediately see the thing itself of which that trisyllabic word is the sign you would be pointing it out without using any words ad i agree that is possible but only in the case of names signifying corporeal objects if these objects were at hand aug but surely we do not call a colour a cor poreal object is it not rather a quality of a corporeal object ad it is so aug why then can it too be pointed out with the finger do you include the qualities of corporeal objects the teacher 73 among corporeal objects at least so far as they can be brought to knowledge wthout words ad when i said corporeal ob j’ects i meant all corporeal things to be understood that is all the qualities of bodies which are susceptible to sense perception aug consider however whether some exceptions are to be made ad you do well to warn me i should have said not all corporeal obj’ects but all visible objects for i admit that sound smell taste weight heat etc which belong to the other senses though they cannot be perceived apart from bodies and are therefore corporeal cannot nevertheless be pointed out with the finger aug have you never seen how men carry on con versation as it were with deaf people by means of gesture and how deaf people similarly by gesture ask questions and reply teach and indicate all their wishes or at least most of them thus not only visible things are pointed out without the use of words but also sounds tastes and other such things actors too in the theatres often unfold and set forth whole stories by danc ing simply and without using a single word ad i have no adverse comment to make except that neither i nor your dancing actor will ever be able to point out to you what the preposition ex signifies without using words 6 perhaps you are right but suppose he could you would i imagine have no hesitation in saying that whatever movement of his body he used in trying to show me the thing signified by that word it would still be a sign and not the thing itself therefore though he indeed would not explain a word by a word he would none the less explain a sign by a sign so that both the monosyllable ex and his gesture would signify one thing which i was asking to have pointed out to me without a sign directly ad pray how can that possibly be done aug the way a w all does it ad but even a wall as our reasoning showed cannot be shown without a pointing finger the holding out of the finger is not the wall but the sign by means of which the wall is pointed out so far as i can see there is nothing which can be shown without signs aug suppose i were to ask you what walking is and you were to get up and do it wouldn’t you be using tlie tiling itself to show me not words or any other signs ad yes of course i am ashamed that i did not notice so obvious a fact now thousands of examples come to my mind of things which can be demonstrated im mediately and without signs such as eating drinking sitting standing shouting and other things innumerable aug well then tell me this supposing i had no idea of the meaning of 4 augustine earlier writings the word talking and i were to ask you when you were walking what walking means how would you teach me ad i should walk a little more quickly the change in speed would give notice that i was replying to your question and i should still be doing what i was asked to demonstrate aug but you know there is a difference between walking and hastening he who walks does not suddenly hasten and he who hastens does not necessarily walk we speak of hastening in writing reading and very many other things consequently if after my query you did what you had been doing only a little more quickly i should conclude that walking was the same thing as hastening for the acceleration was the new feature of your behaviour so i should be misled ad i admit that a thing cannot be demonstrated without a sign at any rate if the thing is an action in which we are engaged when we are ques tioned if we add nothing new to what we are doing our ques tioner will think that we don't want to show him but are con tinuing in what we were doing without paying any attention to him but if his inquiry is about actions which we can perform and if we are not doing them when he inquires by doing it after he has inquired we can demonstrate what he asks by the actual thing and not merely by a sign a special case would arise if while i was speaking someone asked me what speaking was in order to let him know i must speak whatever i actually may say and i shall continue to show him until i make plain to him what he wants to know not departing from the actual thing which he wished to have demonstrated to him and yet not seeking signs apart from the thing itself wherewith to demonstrate it iv 7 aug most acutely stated are we now agreed that there are two classes of things that can be demonstrated without signs those which we are not engaged in doing when we are asked and can immediately start doing and those in which the action consists in simply giving signs for when we speak we make signs whence is derived the verb to signify ad agreed aug when the question concerns signs merely signs can be demonstrated by signs but when the question is about things which are not signs they can be demonstrated by carrying out the action if possible after the question has been asked or by giving signs by means of which the things can be brought to mind ad that is so aug here then we have a threefold classification let us first consider if you please the case of signs being demonstrated by signs words are not the only the teacher 75 signs ad no aug it seems to me that in speaking we use words to signify words or other signs as when we say gesture or letter for these two words also signify signs or we may express in words something which is not a sign as for example when we say the word stone the word is a sign for it sig nifies something but what it signifies is not a sign but this kind of case where words signify things that are not signs does not concern our present discussion for we undertook to con sider those cases where signs are demonstrated by signs and we found that they fall into two classes those in which we teach or call to remembrance by signs similar signs and those in which we teach or call to remembrance different signs do you agree ad clearly 8 aug tell me to what sense do verbal signs pertain ad to the sense of hearing aug and gesture ad to sight aug what about written words surely they are w ords or are they better understood as signs of words a word is a meaningful articulate sound and sound is perceived by no other sense than hearing when a word is written a sign is given to the eyes whereby something that properly belongs to the ears is brought to mind ad i agree entirely aug you will also agree i imagine that when we pronounce the word nomen name we signify something ad true aug what then ad that by w hich something or somebody is called for example romulus rome virtue a river etc etc aug these four names signify something ad indeed they do 4 is there a difference between these names and the things they signify ad a great difference aug i should like you to tell me what is the difference ad in the first place the names are signs the things are not aug shall we call things which can be signified by signs but are not signs significables as we call things that can be seen visible it will simplify our discussion of them ad very well aug can these four signs you have just mentioned be signified by no other sign ad i am surprised that you should think i have already forgotten that we found that written words are signs of spoken words signs therefore of signs aug what is the dif ference ad written words are visible spoken words are audible why should we not use the word audible if we allow significable aug i allow it at once and am grateful for your suggestion but i ask again whether these four signs cannot be signified by any other audible sign as well as by the visible signs you have called to mind ad i recall that this too was 76 augustine earlier writings said recently in our discussion i said that a name signified some thing and i gave these four examples i recognize that the word name and these four names are all audible when spoken aug what then is the difference between an audible sign and other audible signs signified by it ad so far as i can see the difference between the word name and the four examples is this it is the audible sign of audible signs they are the audible signs not of signs but of things pardy visible like romulus rome river partly intelligible like virtue 9 aug i understand and approve but you know that every articulate sound pronounced with some meaning is called a word ad i do aug name therefore is a word when it is pronounced articulately with a meaning when we say of a fluent man that he uses good words we mean also that he uses names when the slave in terence said to his aged master good words i pray you he used many names ad i agree aug so when we pronounce these two syllables ver bum we also signify a name and the one word is the sign of the other ad i agree aug here is another question i should like you to answer you have said that word is a sign pointing to name and name is a sign pointing to river and river is the sign of a thing which can be seen also you have explained the difference between this thing and river which is its sign and between river and name which is the sign of a sign what do you think is the difference between the sign of a name that is a word and the name itself of which it is the sign ad i understand the difference to be this what is signified by name is also signified by word a name is a word and river is a word but everything that has a verbal sign does not have a nominal sign for si at the beginning of the verse you quoted and ex where this long course of reasoning started are words but they are not names and there are many other such words all names are words but all words are not names so the difference between a word and a name is i think clear that is between the sign of a sign which signifies no other signs and the sign of a sign that points to other signs aug every horse is an animal but every animal is not a horse ad indubitably aug there is the same difference between name and word as between horse and animal unless perhaps you are prevented from assenting by the fact that we use the word verb in a special sense to signify those things which have tenses i write i wrote i read i have read clearly these are not names ad you have mentioned exactly what caused me the teacher 77 to hesitate aug don’t let that trouble you in all cases where words are employed and something is signified we speak of signs universally and without qualification on the other hand we speak of military signs which are properly called signs be cause words are not used if i were to say to you that just as every horse is an animal but every animal is not a horse so every word is a sign but every sign is not a word you would not hesitate i believe ad now i understand and agree that there is the same difference between a w ord universally and a name as between animal and horse 10 aug you know that when we say animal that tri syllabic name pronounced by the voice is a different thing from that which it signifies ad we have admitted that is true for all signs and significables aug do you think that ail signs signify something different from themselves just as the three syllables of the word animal cannot signify the word itself ad not altogether for when we say the word sign it sig nifies not only all other signs but also itself for it is a word and all words are signs aug does not the same thing happen when we say the word verbum if that word signifies every meaningful articulate sound it is itself included in that cate gory ad it is aug isn’t it the same with the word name it signifies names of all categories and is itself the name of no category if i were to ask you what part of speech is a name could you answer correctly except by saying it is a noun ad no indeed aug there are therefore signs which signify themselves as well as other signs ad there are aug do you think that the same is true with the quadrisyllabic sign con junction when spoken ad by no means it is a name but the things it signifies are not names v ii aug you have been most attentive now consider whether there are signs which signify each other mutually the one being signified by the other this is not the case with the word conjunction and the words signified by it such as if or for unless therefore since and the like all these arc sig nified by that one word but by none of them is that word signified ad i see and i should like to learn what signs sig nify one another mutually aug when we say name and word we use two words ad yes aug and when we use these two words we at the same time use two names ad yes aug so that name signifies word just as word sig nifies name ad i agree aug can you say how they differ except that they sound differently and are spelt differently 78 augustine earlier writings perhaps i can remembering what i said a little while ago by words we mean everything articulately spoken and with some meaning so every name including the word name is a word but every word is not a name though the word word is itself a name 12 aug if someone were to affirm and prove that just as every name is a word so every word is a name could you point out the difference except in sound and spelling ad i could not and i do not think there is a difference aug if all arti culate and meaningful sounds are both words and names but for one reason they are called words and for another names will there be no difference ad i don’t understand how that could be aug you understand at any rate that every coloured thing is visible and that every visible thing is coloured though these two words have quite different meanings ad i do aug what if similarly every word is a name and every name a word though these two words viz name and word have different meanings ad i now see it might be so but i wait for you to show me how aug you are aware i suppose that every articulate significant sound smites the ear in order that it may be perceived remembered and known ad i am aware of that aug therefore whenever we speak two things hap pen ad that is so aug what if words are so called from one of these two things and names from the other that is to say if verbum derives from verberarey nomen from noscere the former would receive its due appellation from something that happens to the ear the latter from something that happens in the mind 13 ad i shall agree when you show me how we can cor rectly say that all words are names aug that is easy i sup pose you once learned and still remember that a pronoun is so called because it can stand for a noun name though it char acterizes its object less fully than the noun it has replaced i believe this is the definition which you used to repeat to your grammar teacher a pronoun is a part of speech which when put in place of a noun designates the same object but less fully ad i remember and i approve aug you see then that according to this definition pronouns can serve only in place of nouns and can be put only in the place of nouns for ex ample we say this man the king himself the same woman this gold that silver this that himself the same are pronouns man king woman gold silver are nouns by means of which the things are more fully the teacher 79 described than by the pronouns ad i see and agree aug now name a few conjunctions whichever you like ad and but also aug don’t you think that all these you have mentioned are names nouns ad not at all do you think that i have used correct language in saying all these y cn have mentioned ad quite correct and now i understand that you have been showing me in a wonderful way that these were nouns which i mentioned for otherwise it would not be correct to refer to them as these but i have still a suspicion that i judged your language to be correct because these con junctions are undeniably words therefore we can correctly refer to them as all these viz all these words if you ask me what part of speech is words i can only answer a noun so that your expression was correct perhaps because the pro noun was implicitly attached to this noun 14 aug an acute observation but you are wrong to cor rect your error listen attentively to what i say if i can manage to express myself as i wish to use words to treat of words is as complicated as to rub fingers together and expect someone else to distinguish which fingers tingle with warmth and which help others to tingle ad i give you all my attention for your similitude has aroused my interest aug words are a com pound of sound and letters ad that is right aug let us use a citation from an authority dearest of all to us when the apostle paul says in christ there was not yea and nay but in him was yea we are not to think i suppose that these three letters e s t were in christ but rather that which is signified by them ad quite true aug when he says in him was he is to be understood as meaning in him was what we call est being if he had said in him was virtue he would have to be understood to mean in him was what we call virtue we should not have to think that these two syllables which we use when w e speak of virtue were in him but rather that the quality denoted by the word virtue w as in him ad i follow you aug you understand that there is no dif ference between is called virtue and is named virtue ai that is clear aug it is equally clear that there is no difference between in him was what is called and in him was what is named estd ad i see there is no difference aug do you see now what i am trying to point out to you ad not quite aug you see that a name is that by which a thing is named ad nothing is clearer aug then you see that est is a name noun if that which was in him is named est 80 augustine earlier writings being ad undeniably aug but if i were to ask you what part of speech is est you would i suppose say it was not a noun but a verb though our reasoning has taught us that it is also a noun ad it is just as you say aug do you still hesitate to regard as names the other parts of speech names in the sense we have demonstrated ad i do not hesitate now that i have to confess that they may be signs of something but if you ask what the specific things signified are called or named i cannot answer i can refer only to those parts of speech which we do not usually call names but which i see we are now con strained so to call 15 aug are you not disturbed by the possibility that there may be someone who would weaken our argument by saying that we must attribute to the apostle authority in the matter of realities but not in the use of words the ground of our argu ment would not be so sure as we had assumed it is possible that though paul lived and taught with absolute rectitude his language was less correct when he wrote in him was est especially when he himself confesses that he was unskilled in speech how do you think we ought to refute such a man ad i have nothing to urge against him i pray you find someone among the acknowledged masters of words by whose authority you can effect what you desire aug you think that without authorities reason itself is hardly sufficient but reason itself demonstrates that all the parts of speech may signify some thing that consequently they may be names or nouns this can be most easily seen by comparing different languages obviously if you ask what is the greek name for our quis the answer is tis for volo thelo for bene kalds for scriptuniy to gegrammenon for ety kai for ab apo for heu oi the question can thus be correctly asked about all the parts of speech as i have enumerated them this could not be done unless they were names when we can by this process of reasoning apart from the authority of all the eloquent men prove that the apostle paul spoke correctly what need is there to seek anyone to buttress our argument with his personal authority 16 but possibly some man from greater stupidity or im pudence may not agree but on the contrary may assert that he will give way only to those authorities who with universal con sent are allowed to lay down the law in regard to words what in the latin tongue can be found more excellent than cicero and yet he in his noblest orations called the verrine orations calls mam a noun now coram is a preposition or possibly an the teacher 8i adverb in that particular passage it may be that i do not cor rectly understand the passage and others may explain it dif ferently but there is one point to which i think there is no possible answer the best masters of dialectic tell us that a com plete sentence whether affirmative or negative what tullius somewhere also calls a pronouncement consists of a noun and a verb and when the verb is in the third person the noun they say and rightly must be in the nominative case now con sider this point when we say the man sits and the horse runs you observ'c there are two pronouncements ad i do aug in each of them there is one noun in the one case man in the other horse there is likewise one verb sits in the one case runs in the other ad so i observe aug if i said simply sits or runs you would very properly ask me who or what i should have to reply the man the horse the animal or some other noun which when added to the verb completes the pronouncement or affirmative or negative sentence ad i understand aug now listen suppose we see some object rather far away and are uncertain whether it is an animal or a stone or something else suppose i say to you because it is a man it is an animal shouldn’t i be speaking rashly ad you would indeed but not if you said if it is a man it is an animal aug you are right so in your sentence if satisfies us both and in mine because is felt to be wrong ad i agree aug now are these two pronouncements com plete sentences if satisfies and because is wrong ad yes they are complete aug now tell me which are the verbs and which the nouns ad the verbs are satisfies and is wrong and the nouns must be if and because aug it is therefore sufficiently proved that these two conjunc tions can also be nouns ad qydtt sufficiently aug can you by yourself prove that the other parts of speech can be brought under the same rule ad i can vi 17 aug let us then pass on tell me whether you think that just as we have found that all words are names and all names are wmrds so all names are substantives and ail sub stantives are names ad i see no difference between them ex cept their sounds i make no objection provisionally there are some who see a distinction between them in meaning too but we need not consider their opinion just now but at least you observe that we have reached signs which signify one another mutually differing in nothing but sound and which signify themselves together with all the other parts of speech a.e.w 6 82 augustine earlier writings ad i don’t understand aug don’t you understand that substantive signifies name and name substantive and that there is no difference between them except in sound so far as concerns the general concept name for of course we use the concept name or noun in a special sense when we use it to denote one of the eight parts of speech over against the other seven ad that i understand aug that is what i meant when i said that substantive and name signify one another mutually 1 8 ad i understand that but i wonder what you meant by saying they signify themselves together with the other parts of speech aug didn’t our previous argument teach us that all parts of speech can be used as names and substantives that is may be signified by the signs name and substantive ad that is so aug if i ask you the meaning of no men i mean that disyllabic sound wouldn’t you correctly reply nomerti ad yes aug but it is not surely the same with the sign we give when we pronounce the four syllables con junc ti ol this name cannot be enumerated among the conjunctions which it signifies ad that i accept as right aug so you see what i meant by saying a name which signifies itself and all the other things it signifies you can work this out for your self if you like in the case of the word substantive ad easily enough but it occurs to me that name is used in both a general and a special sense substantive is not accepted among the eight parts of speech so there must be a difference in meaning besides the difference in sound aug what dif ference is there between nomen and onoma except a difference of sound the difference between the latin and the greek lan guages ad in this case i see no difference save one of sound aug so we have discovered signs which signify themselves and one another mutually whatever is signified by the one is also signified by the other and they differ only in sound we have just found out this fourth characteristic the three former ones we learned in connection with names and words ad yes that is what we have discovered vii 19 aug i should like you to recall what we have learned as a result of our conversation ad i shall do the best i can to begin with i recall that we spent some time in inquir ing why we use speech and we saw that we did so in order to teach or to call to mind even when we ask questions our motive is simply to let the person questioned know what we want to hear we seem to sing for the pleasure it gives us but the the teacher 83 pleasure derives from the melody and not properly from the words sung in prayer we cannot hold that god needs to be taught or reminded so that when we use words we do so to re mind ourselves or to admonish and teach others then we decided that words were simply signs things which do not signify something beyond themselves cannot be signs then you quoted the verse si nihil ex tanta superis placet urbe relinqui and i tried to show what each word signified we could not discover what the second word signifies though it is a well known obvious word i thought it was not an empty word but did express something perhaps the state of mind of one who discovers that the object of his search does not exist or at least thinks he has made that discovery you made some reply jestingly avoiding the profundity of the question and putting it off for another time don’t think i have forgotten the explana tion you owe me then i tried to explain the third w ord in the verse and you urged me not to explain it by means of a synonym but to show the reality which the word signified i said it was impossible to do this in conversation so we came to things which can be pointed out with the finger i thought all corporeal objects were of this kind but we found that only vis ible things were then somehow we spoke of deaf people and actors who without words and by gestures alone signify not only visible things but much else besides indeed nearly every thing we speak about and we decided that these gestures also were signs then we began again to inquire how we could without signs point out actual things since a wall a colour all visible things are indicated by pointing with the finger which is it self a sign when i wrongly said that nothing could be found which could be shown without a sign we agreed that it w as possible in the case of actions provided w e were not performing them when we were questioned if we could perform them when questioned but speaking was not among such actions for even if we were asked while we were speaking what speaking is it would clearly be easy to demonstrate the action by performing the action itself 20 hence we learned that signs are demonstrated by si s also other things which are not signs likewise without a sign actions can be demonstrated which we can perform on being questioned of these three statements we undertook to con sider diligently and to discuss the first the discussion showed 84 augustine earlier writings that on the one hand there are signs which cannot be signified by the signs they themselves signify for example the word conjunction on the other hand some can for example the word sign signifies a word and the word word signifies a sign so that sign and word are both signs and words in the class of signs which are mutually significant it was shown that there are degrees of correspondence the sound sig num signifies everything by which anything is signified but ver bum is not a sign of all signs but only of those which are articulately pronounced hence it is manifest that while sig num signifies ver bum and vice versa signum applies more widely than verbum but in a general sense verbum and noinen have the same range of application our argument showed us that all the parts of speech can be names because pronouns can be substituted for or added to them of all of them it can be said that they name something and there is none of them which cannot be made the subject of a verb to form a complete sentence but though name and word have the same range of applicability since all words are names yet they are not identical in meaning we gave a probable reason for the distinction between word and name viz verbum is derived from verberare to strike the ear nomen from the mental process of reminding when we want to memorize something we rightly say what is its name but we do not usually say what is its word of absolute synonyms differing in nothing save in sound and spelling the only example we found was nomen and onoma a latin word and its greek equivalent in the class of mutually significant signs it escaped me that we had found no sign which does not signify itself among the other signs it signifies there i have recalled as much as i am able i am sure that in our conversation you have said nothing without conscious design and you will know whether i have summarized our talk properly and in order viii 21 aug you have indeed repeated from memory all i wanted and i must confess these distinctions now seem to me to be much clearer than they did when our discussion forced them out from obscurity but it is hard to say at this point what goal we are striving to reach by all these round about paths probably you think we have just been playing a game and diverting the mind from serious things by these apparently puerile questionings or perhaps that a very small gain has been made if any or if you suspect that some great advantage is to arise from our debate you want to know it now or at ail events to be told what it is i want you to believe that i have the teagheh 85 not been trifling in this conversation thongh perhaps we have been amusing ourselves but the game is not to be regarded as merely puerile nor is it to be thought that only small or moderate advantages have been gained and yet if i say that there is a life eternally blessed and that my desire is that god who is very truth should bring us thither by steps suited to our poor abilities i am afraid i shall appear ridiculous because i set out on so long a journey with the consideration of signs and not of the realities they signify you will pardon me therefore if i play with you to begin with not for the sake of playing but in order to exercise and sharpen our mental powers so that we may be able not merely to endure the heat and light of the region where lies the blessed life but also to love them ad go on as you have begun for i shall never think unv orthy of attention anything you may think it necessary to say or to do 22 aug let us then consider the other side of the problem where signs signify not other signs but what we have agreed to call sigiiificables and first tell me whether man is man ad now i am not sure whether you are joking aug why ad because you think it necessary to ask me that question aug i dare say you would also suppose i was joking if i were to ask you whether the first syllable of that noun is ho and the second mo ad i certainly should aug but these two syllables together make homo do you agree ad who could deny it aug now i ask do these two syllables together make you ad of course not but now i see your point aug you state it then so that i may not seem to be abusive ad you think the conclusion is that i am not a man aug don’t you agree seeing you have agreed that all the premises are true from which this conclusion is reached ad i shall not tell you what i think until you tell me whether in asking whether man is man you meant these two syllables homo or the thing they signify aug you tell me rather in what sense you under stood my question for if it is ambiguous you should have been careful and should not have replied until you were quite sure of the meaning of the question ad the ambiguity would not prevent me from answering that is homo in both senses for tliese two syllables are nothing but these two syllables and what they signify is exactly what is signified by them aug all right but why donh you understand in two senses not only the word homo but the other w ords we have used ad have i not done so take my first question if you had understood it to be nothing but a series of 86 augustine earlier writings syllables you would have made no answer for i should appar ently have asked no question when i asked utrum homo homo sit i used three words repeating one of them twice it is clear that you took the first and last words not as mere syllables but as significant words and so you thought you could reply with cer tainty and confidence ad that is true aug why did you wish to take the middle word only in two senses according to its sound and according to its sense ad now i take the whole sentence according to the sense of the words i agree with you that we cannot carry on a conversation at all unless the words we hear carry the mind to the things of which they are the signs show me now the fallacy of the reasoning which proved that i am not a man aug i shall put the questions again so that you may yourself detect your mistake ad that is better 23 aug i shall not repeat the first question for that has been agreed but now think the syllable ho is ho and mo is mo ad obviously aug together they form homo ad there i went wrong i thought rightly that when a sign is given one should look to what it signified and with that in view should answer yes or no but i allowed significance to separate syllables when of course they have none aug you are quite certain then that no answer should be given to questions except in terms of the things signified by the words ad why not if words are used aug i should like to hear how you would reply to the man in the amusing story who drew the conclusion that a lion had come out of the mouth of his fellow disputant he first asked whether what we say comes out of our mouth that was of course undeniable then he had no difficulty in getting the other in the course of the discussion to mention a hon whereupon he made fun of him and insisted that since he had confessed that what we say comes out of our mouth and since he could not deny that he had said lion therefore with the best intentions he had let out a horrid beast from his mouth ad it would not be difficult to answer that clever jester i should not concede that whatever we say comes out of our mouth for our words are signs merely of things it is the sign and not the thing signified which comes out of the mouth of the speaker in some cases it may be simply the sign of an other sign as we have said earlier in our discussion 24 aug i see you are well armed against that adversary but if i ask whether homo is a noun what answer will you give me ad what else could it be aug when i see you do i see a noun dc no aug shall i point out what follows from the teacher 87 your reply ad please don’t i see for myself that it must be that i am not a man because when you asked whether homo was a noun i replied that it was though i had decided to look to the significance of words in giving an affirmative or a nega tive answer aug still i think there was some advantage gained by your slipping into that reply the very law of reason stamped on our minds has awakened your vigilance if i were to ask simply what is homo you would probably reply an animal but if i wer e to ask what part of speech is homo the only correct answer is a noun so homo is both a noun and an animal it is a noun when it is regarded as a sign and an animal when regard is had to the thing signified by the sign if anyone asks me whether homo is a noun i shall reply that it is for the form of the question indicates sufficiently in what sense the word is to be taken the sense in which it is a sign if he asks whether homo is an animal i shall assent even more readily but if he asks simply what homo is without mentioning either noun or animal my mind following the rule laid down for our dis course would at once turn to the thing signified by these two syllables and would give no other answer b ut animal unless it gave the whole definition which is a rational and mortal animal don’t you think so ad i do but if we have ad mitted that homo is a noun how shall we avoid the insulting conclusion that we are not men aug how else than by ex plaining that the conclusion is inferred by importing into the word a different sense from that which we had understood in giving our assent and if he says that was the sense he intended the conclusion is not to be feared in any way for why should i fear to confess that i am not a man hominem that is i am not these three syllables ad very true why indeed should one be offended when one is said not to be a man in that sense according to our argument nothing could be more true aug the rule which naturally carries the greatest weight is that as soon as signs are heard the attention is directed to tlie things they signify so when the rule is stated it becomes impossible not to suppose that the conclusion refers to what is signified by the two syllables ko mo ad i understand and agree with what you say ix 25 i want you now to understand that things signified are of greater importance than their signs whatever exists on account of something else must necessarily be of less value than that on account of which it exists do you agree ad it seems to me we must not rashly agree to that statement augustine earlier writings the word caenum filth for example is i think far preferable to the thing it signifies what offends us when it is mentioned has nothing to do with the sound of the word change one letter and caenum becomes caelum heaven but what a dif ference there is between the things signified by these two words i should not therefore attribute to the sign the quality i loathe in the thing signified we prefer to hear the word to being brought into contact with the thing with our other senses accordingly i prefer the sign to the thing signified aug you are most observant it is false therefore that things universally are to be preferred to their signs ad so it seems aug tell me then what you think people wanted to achieve when they bestowed that name on an object so nasty and revolting do you approve of what they did or not ad i do not venture to approve or to disapprove nor do i know what they were trying to do aug but you can know what you intend to do when you mention the word ad certainly i want to give a sign to the man with whom i am speaking by means of which i may let him know what i think he ought to know aug the knowledge then conveyed by this word from you to him or from him to you is more valuable than the word itself ad i agree that the knowledge conveyed by the sign is more important than the sign itself but this does not mean that the thing signified is better than its sign 26 aug therefore though it is false that things universally are to be preferred to their signs it is nevertheless true that whatever exists on account of something else is inferior to that on account of which it exists knowledge of filth for example to convey which knowledge the name was invented is more im portant than the name while the name is also to be preferred to the thing it designates as we have discovered the knowledge is superior to the sign simply because it is the end towards which the latter is the means if some gluttonous man a wor shipper of his belly as the apostle says were to say that he lived to eat a temperate man hearing him and unable to bear with him might say how much better it would be if you ate to kve this judgment would proceed from the same rule what displeased him would be that the other valued his life so little that he thought less of it than of the pleasures of gluttony saying that he lived for banqueting the advice to eat in order to live rather than to live in order to eat is justly praised simply be cause it shows understanding of what is means and what is end that is to say of what should be subordinate to what similarly the teacher 89 you or another man of discernment hearing some loquacious lover of verbiage say i teach for the sake of talking would reply my man why don’t you rather talk for the sake of teaching now if this is right as you know it is you see at once how much less value we are to attribute to words than to the things on account of w hich we use words the use to which words are put is superior to the words for words exist to be used and used to teach just as it is better to teach than to talk so speech is better than words and knowledge is much better than words i want to hear if you have any objection to offer 27 ad i agree that knowledge is better than words but i am not sure that no objection can be urged against the general rule that eveiy thing which is means to an end is inferior to the end it serves aug we shall have a better opportunity at an other time to discuss that problem more carefully meantime what you have admitted is sufficient for what i am desirous of establishing now you grant that the knowledge of tliings is better than the signs of things so knowledge of the things sig nified by signs is preferable to knowledge of their signs is it not ad surely i have not granted that the knowledge of things is superior to the knowledge of signs but not superior to the signs themselves i am afraid to give my assent to what you have said if the word filth is better than the thing it signifies knowledge of the word would be preferable to knowledge of the thing and yet the name itself is inferior to the knowledge there are four terms here the name the thing knowledge of the name knowledge of the thing why is not the third better than the fourth just as the first is better than the second and yet surely it is not to be subordinated 28 aug i see you have a wonderful memory for retaining your admissions and an excellent way of expounding your views but take the word vice when we pronounce the word m ti um you know that it is better than the tiling it signifies and yet mere knowledge of the word is much inferior to knowledge of the vices let us consider your four terms the name the thing knowledge of the name knowledge of the thing we rightly prefer the first to the second when persius used the name in his poem this man is stupefied by vice he committed no fault of versification indeed he added an ornament and yet the thing signified by the word makes the man in whom it is found necessarily vicious but there is not tlie same relation between your third and fourth terms the fourth is obviously better than the third knowledge of the word vice augustine earlier writings 90 is inferior to knowledge of the vices ad do you think that knowledge is preferable even when it makes us more miserable for above all the penalties thought of by the cruelty of tyrants or calculated by their greed persius sets this one penalty which tortures men who are compelled to acknowledge vices which they cannot avoid aug in the same way you could deny that knowledge of the virtues is preferable to knowledge of the word virtue for to see and not to possess virtue was the punishment which the satirist wished tyrants to suffer ad may god avert such madness now i understand that the knowledge imparted to the mind by a good education is not to be blamed but those are to be judged most miserable of all who are affected by a disease which no medicine can cure this i think was persius view too aug quite right but it does not matter to us what persius thought in such matters we are not subject to the authority of such as he it is not easy to explain how one kind of knowledge is preferable to another it is enough for my pre sent purpose that we agree that knowledge of things signified is better than the signs even if not better than knowledge of the signs now let us discuss the greater problem what kind of things as we said can be pointed out by themselves without signs such as speaking walking lying and suchlike ad i remember the problem x 29 aug do you think that all actions which we can perform on being interrogated can be demonstrated without a sign or is there any exception ad considering this whole class of things i find none which can be shown without a sign except perhaps speaking or possibly teaching for whatever i do by way of demonstration when someone has asked a ques tion i see that he cannot learn immediately from the action which he wants to have demonstrated to him even if i am doing nothing or am doing something else when i am asked what walking is and if i immediately set about walking and try to give an answer to the question without a sign how am i to make sure that walking is not taken to mean walking the exact distance that i actually walked in that case my ques tioner would be deceived and would imagine that anyone who walked further or less far than i had walked had not in fact walked at all and what i have said of this one action applies to all those which i thought could be demonstrated without a sign except the two i have mentioned 30 aug i grant that but now don't you think speaking and teaching are different things ad certainly if they were the teacher 9 the same no one could teach without speaking who can doubt there is a difference seeing that in fact we can teach many things with other signs besides words aug is there any dif ference between teaching and giving signs ad i think they are the same thing aug so it is correct to say that we give signs in order to teach ad qpite correct aug if anyone says that we teach in order to give signs he can easily be re futed by the previous sentence ad that is so aug if w e give signs in order that we may teach and do not teach in order that we may give signs teaching and giving signs are different things ad you are right and i was wtong when i said they were the same aug now does he who show s us what teaching is do it by giving signs or otherwise ad i do not see how he can do it otherwise aug so you were wrong in saying a moment ago that when the question is what teaching is the true answer can be given without signs even this we see can not be done without signs and you have agreed that giving signs is a different thing from teaching if as now appears they are different teaching cannot be demonstrated without signs and by itself alone as you thought so up to this point we have discovered nothing that can be demonstrated by simply per forming the action except speaking which consists in giving signs but even speaking is itself a sign so that it seems there is absolutely nothing which can be taught without signs ad i have no reason for refusing my assent 31 aug it is established then that d nothing is taught without signs knowledge should be more precious to us than the signs by means of which we acquire it though r pos sibly not all things which are signified are better than the signs which indicate them ad so it seems aug just think what a tiny result has been reached by so long and circuitous a path since we began our conversation which has now continued for a long time we have laboured to find answers to three ques tions a whether anything can be taught without signs d whether some signs are to be preferred to the things which they signify c whether the knowledge of things is better than the knowledge of their signs but there is a fourth question to which i should like to hear your answer do you think our results now stand beyond all doubt ad i should dearly like to think that after all these turnings and twistings we have in deed reached certainty but your question makes me anxious and deters me from answering in the affirmative for it seems to me that you would not have asked the question unless you 92 augustine earlier writings had some difficulty in mind the complexity of our problems does not allow me to examine the whole field or to answer with complete confidence i am afraid there is something hidden in these complexities to penetrate to which my mind is not sharp enough aug i am not at all unhappy about your hesitation for it indicates a cautious mind and caution is the best guard of tranquillity it is the most difficult thing in the world not to be upset when opinions which we hold and to which we have given a too ready and too wilful approval are shattered by contrary arguments and are as it were weapons torn from our hands it is a good thing to give in calmly to arguments that are well considered and grasped just as it is dangerous to hold as known what in fact we do not know we should be on our guard lest when things are frequently undermined which we assumed would stand firm and abide we fall into such hatred or fear of reason that we think we cannot trust even the most clearly manifest truth 32 but come let us consider expeditiously whether you do right to hesitate about our conclusions suppose someone ignorant of how birds are deceived by twigs and birdlime should meet a birdcatcher equipped with his instruments but merely travelling and not actually engaged in his work suppose he followed the birdcatcher step by step and wonderingly thought and inquired what could be the purpose of the man’s equip ment suppose the birdcatcher seeing him all attention and eager to display his skill got ready his twigs and tubes and hawk and caught a bird would he not teach the spectator what he wanted to know by the action itself and without any signs ad i suspect the same trouble would arise as i described in the case of the man who asked what walking was so far as i see the whole art of birdcatching has not been demonstrated aug that trouble can easily be removed by adding a further supposition suppose the spectator were sufficiently intelligent to learn the whole art from what he saw it is sufficient for our present purpose that some men can be taught some not all things without a sign ad i can make the same additional supposition in the other case a man who is sufficiently intel ligent will learn the exact meaning of walking when the action has been shown by taking a few paces aug i have no objection to your doing so and indeed i approve both of us have now shown that some men can be taught some things without signs and that our previous view was wrong that nothing at all can be shown without signs hence not one or the teacher 93 two things but thousands of things occur to my mind which can be shown by themselves and without any sign why should we doubt it i need not mention the innumerable spectacles which men exhibit in the theatres showing them without any sign and just as they are think of the sun the light that suffuses and clothes all things the moon and the stars earth and sea and the innumerable things they bear does not god exhibit them in themselves to those who behold them 33 if we consider this a little more closely perhaps you will find that nothing is learned even by its appropriate sign if i am given a sign and i do not know the thing of which it is the sign it can teach me nothing if i know the thing what do i learn from the sign when i read dan 3 27 lxx dan 3 94 their saraballae were not changed the word saraballae does not indicate what it means if i am told that some covering of the head is so called would i know what a head is or a covering unless i knew already knowledge of such things comes to me not when they are named by others but when i actually see them when these two syllables first struck my ear ca put i was as ignorant of what they meant as i was of the meaning of saraballae when i first heard or read it but when the word caput was frequently repeated observing when it was said i discovered it was the name of a thing well known to me from my having seen it before i made that discovery the word was merely a sound to me it became a sign w hen i had learned the thing of which it was the sign and this i had learned not from signs but from seeing the actual object so the sign is learned from knowing the thing rather than vice versa 34 to understand this better suppose we hear the sound caput for the first time not knowing whether it is merely a sound or whether it has some meaning we ask what capui is remember we want to know not the thing signified but the sign although we cannot have that knowledge so long as we do not know what it is a sign of if then in answer to our question the thing is pointed out with a finger we look at it and learn that that was a sign which we had heard but had not known before in a sign there are two things sound and meaning we per ceive the sound when it strikes our ear while the meaning be comes clear when we look at the thing signified the pointing with the finger can indicate nothing but the object pointed out and it points not to a sign but to a part of the body which we call capul in that way accordingly i cannot learn the thing because i knew it already nor can i learn the sign because it is 94 augustine earlier writings not pointed to i am not greatly interested in the act of pointing as a gesture it is a sign of something being pointed out rather than of the object pointed out it is as when we say to for we are accustomed to use that adverb when we point with the finger in case one sign is not sufficient what i am really trying to convince you of if i can is this we learn noth ing by means of these signs we call words on the contrary as i said we learn the force of the word that is the meaning which lies in the sound of the word when we come to know the object signified by the word then only do we perceive that the word was a sign conveying that meaning 35 the same is true of the word coverings and all the rest but even when i have come to know them all i still do not know what saraballae are if someone points them out or makes a drawing of them or shows me something like them i shall not say that he did not teach me what they were tlxough i could easily prove that that is true with a little more argument i content myself with saying what is obvious he did not teach me by words if he saw them when i was present and called my attention to them by saying lo there dut saraballae i should learn something i did not know not from any words spoken but by looking at the object pointed out to me in this way i should learn and remember the thing that gives meaning to the word in learning the thing i did not trust the words of another but my own eyes i trusted the words simply so far as to direct my attention to what was pointed out that is to find my answer by looking at a visible object xi 36 the utmost value i can attribute to words is this they bid us look for things but they do not show them to us so that we may know them he alone teaches me anything who sets before my eyes or one of my other bodily senses or my mind the things which i desire to know from words we can learn only words indeed we can learn only their sound and noise even if words in order to be words really must also be signs i do not know that any sound i may hear is a word until i know what it means knowledge of words is completed by knowledge of things and by the hearing of words not even words are learned we learn nothing new when we know the words already and when we don’t know them we cannot say we have learned anything unless we also learn their meaning and their meaning we learn not from hearing their sound when they are uttered but from getting to know the things they sig nify it is sound reasoning and truly said that when words are the teacher 95 spoken we either know or do not know what they mean if we know we do not learn but are rather reminded of what we know if we do not know we are not even reminded but are perhaps urged to inquire 37 but you may say granted we cannot know those head coverings the sound of whose name we remember unless we see them and that we cannot fully know the name until we know the thing but what about those young men of whom we have heard dan 3 how they vanquished king nebuchad nezzar and his fiery furnace by their faithfulness and religion how they sang praises to god and won honours from their enemy have we learned about them otherwise than by means of words i reply yes but we already knew the meaning of all these words i already knew the meaning of three youths furnace fire king unhurt by fire and so on but the names ananias azarias and misael are as unknown to me as saraballae and the names did not help me to know them and could not help me all that read of in that story happened at that time and was written down so that i have to confess i must believe rather than know and the writers whom we believe were not ignorant of the difference for the prophet says unless ye believe ye shall not know isa 7 9 lxx this he would not have said if he had thought there vas no dif ference what i know i also believe but i do not know every thing that i believe all that i understand i know but i do not know all that i believe and i know how useful it is to believe many things which i do not know among them this story about the three youths i know how useful it is to believe many things of wdiich knowledge is not possible 38 concerning universals of which we can have knowledge we do not listen to anyone speaking and making sounds outside ourselves we listen to truth which presides over our minds within us though of course we may be bidden to listen by someone using words our real teacher is he who is so listened to w ho is said to dwell in the inner man namety christ that is the unchangeable power and eternal wisdom of god to this wisdom every rational soul gives heed but to each is given only so much as he is able to receive according to his own good or evil will if anyone is ever deceived it is not the fault of truth any more than it is the fault of the common light of day that the bodily eyes are often deceived confessedly we must pay heed to the light that it may let us discern visible tilings so fax as we are able g6 augustine earlier writings xiij 39 on the one hand we need light that we may sec colours and the elements of this world and sentient bodies that we may perceive things of sense and the senses themselves which the mind uses as interpreters in its search for sense hnowledge on the other hand to know intelligible things with our reason we pay attention to the interior truth how then can it be shown that words teach us anything besides the sound that strikes the ear everything we perceive we perceive either by bodily sense or by the mind the former we call sensible things the latter intelligible things or to use the termin ology of our christian authors the former we call carnal things the latter spiritual things when we are asked about the former we reply if they are present to our senses for example if we are looking at the new moon and someone asks what it is or y here if our questioner does not see it he believes our words or perhaps often does not believe them but he learns nothing unless he himself sees what he is asking about when he sees he learns not from words uttered but from the objects seen and his sense of sight words would have the same sound whether he saw or not when the question concerns not things which are present to our senses but which once were we do not speak of the things themselves but of images derived from them and imprinted on the memory i do not know how we can call these things true since what we have in view are only false images unless it is because we speak of them not as things we see and feel but as things we have seen and felt so in the halls of memory wc bear the images of things once perceived as memorials which we can contemplate mentally and can speak of with a good con science and without dying but these memorials belong to us privately if anyone hears me speak of them provided he has seen them himself he does not learn from my words but recognizes the truth of what i say by the images which he has in his own memory but if he has not had these sensations obviously he believes my words rather than learns from them 40 but when we have to do with things which we behold with the mind that is with the intelligence and with reason we speak of things which we look upon directly in the inner light of truth which illumines the inner man and is inwardly enjoyed there again if my hearer sees these things himself with his inward eye he comes to know what i say not as a result of my words but as a result of his own contemplation even when i speak what is true and he sees what is true it is not i who teach him he is taught not by my words but by the things the teacher 97 themselves which inwardly god has made manifest to him accordingly if asked he can make answer regarding these things what could be more absurd than that he should suppose that by my speaking i have taught him when if asked he could himself have explained these things before i spoke it often happens that a man when asked a question gives a negative answer but by further questioning can be brought to answer in the affirmative the reason lies in his own weakness he is unable to let the light illumine the whole problem though he cannot behold the whole all at once yet when he is questioned about the parts wliich compose the vvffiole he is induced to bring them one by one into the light he is so induced by the words of his questioner words mark you which do not make statements but merely ask such questions as put him who is questioned in a position to learn inwardly for example if i were to ask you the question 1 am at present discussing can nothing be taught by means of words it might at first seem to you to be absurd because you cannot visualize the whole problem so i must put my question in a way suited to your ability to hear the inward teacher then when you have admitted that what i said was true that you are certain of it and assuredly know it i should say where did you learn that you might reply that i had taught you then i should say if i were to tell you that i had seen a man flying would my words render you as certain of their truth as if i had said wise men are better than fools you would certainly say no i don’t believe your first statement or if i believe it i certainly do not know that it is true but your second statement i know most certainly to be true in this way you would realize that neither in the case of your not knowing what i affirmed nor in tlie case of your knowing quite well had you learned anything from my words because in answer to each question you were able to answer confidently that you did not know this and that you did know that when you realize that all the parts which constitute the whole are clear and certain you will then admit what you had denied you will agree that a man who has heard what we have said must either not know whether it is true or know that it is false or know that it is true in the first case he must either believe it or suppose it or doubt it in the second case he must oppose it and deny it in the third case he must testify to its truth in no case therefore will he learn when my words have been spoken both he who does not know whether my words are true and he who knows they are false gs augustine earlier writings and he who could have given the same answers when asked are proved to have learned nothing from my words xiii 41 wherefore in matters which are discerned by the mind whoever cannot discern them for himself listens vainly to the words of him who can except that it is useful to believe such things so long as ignorance lasts whoever can discern them for himself is inwardly a disciple of the truth and out wardly a judge of the speaker or rather of what he says for often enough the hearer knows what is said even when the speaker does not for example suppose some believer in the epicureans who held that the soul is mortal should expound the arguments used by wiser men in favour of the soul’s immortality in the hearing of one who can behold spiritual things the latter judges that the former has spoken the truth though the speaker does not know whether his words are true and indeed believes them to be utterly false are we to think that he can teach what he does not know yet he uses the same words as he might use who does know 42 hence words do not even have the function of indicating the mind of the speaker if it is uncertain whether he knows what he is saying there are liars too and deceivers so that you can easily understand that words not only do not reveal the mind but even serve to conceal it i do not of course in any way doubt that the words of truthful people are endeavouring to reveal the mind of the speaker and make some claim to do so and would do so all would agree if only liars were not allowed to speak and yet we have often experienced in ourselves and others that words do not correctly convey thoughts this can happen in one or other of two ways a speech committed to memory and frequently conned may be spoken when we are thinking of something else entirely this often happens when we are singing a hymn or by a slip of the tongue some words will get sub stituted for others against our will so that those which are heard are not signs of what is in our minds liars too think of the the things they speak about so that even if we do not know whether they speak the truth at least we know that they intend what they say unless either of the two accidents occur which i have mentioned if anyone contends that this sometimes occurs and can be noticed when it occurs i make no objection though it often is hidden and has often escaped my notice when i have been listening 43 there is the other kind of accident very wide spread and the seed of innumerable dissensions and strifes the speaker in the teacher 99 deed expresses his thoughts but is understood only by himself and by some others what he says does not convey the same meaning to those who hear him for example someone might say in our hearing that some wild beasts surpass man in virtue our impulse would be not to endure it but to use every effort to refute such a false and pestilential opinion but possibly he is giving the name of virtue to bodily strength and has correctly expressed his mind he is not lying he is not substantially wrong he is not uttering words committed to memory while he he has something else in mind he has not spoken the wrong word by a slip of the tongue he has simply called the thing he has in mind by a different name from the one we are accus tomed to use we should at once agree with him if we could see into his thought which he had not made clear by the words he used in expressing his opinion it is said that definition is the remedy for this mistake if in this question he would define virtue it would be apparent they say that the controversy was not about the substance of his statement but about a wmrd i should agree that that is so but how often is a man to be found who is good at definition many things too are urged against the discipline of definition but this is not the opportune place to deal with them and i do not approve of them 44 i need not mention the fact that often we do not rightly hear what is said and enter into lengthy arguments over things we wrongly thought w e heard for example recently when i said that a certain punic word meant mercy you said that you had heard from those who knew the language better that it meant piety i objected insisting that you had quite misunder stood what you had been told for i thought you said not piety but faith now you w ere sitting quite close to me and these two words are not so alike in sound as to deceive the ear for a long time i thought you did not know what had been told you while all the time i did not know what you had said if i had heard you aright i should not have thought it absurd that piety and mercy should be expressed by one word in punic such mis understandings often occur but as i said let us omit them lest i should put upon w ords the blame that is due to the negligence of listeners or seem to be troubled by human deafness my chief troubles are those i have mentioned where by means of w ords clearly heard latin words when latin is our mother tongue we are yet unable to learn the thoughts of those who speak to us xiv 45 putting aside all these exceptions i agree that 100 augustine earlier writings when words are heard by one who knows them he can also know that the speaker has thought the things which the words signify now the question is does he also learn that the words spoken are true do teachers profess that it is their thoughts that are learned and retained and not the disciplines which they imagine they transmit by their speaking who is so foolishly curious as to send his son to school to learn what the teacher thinks when the teachers have expounded by means of words all the disciplines which they profess to teach the dis ciplines also of virtue and wisdom then their pupils take thought within themselves whether what they have been told is true looking to the inward truth that is to say so far as they are able in this way they learn and when they find inwardly that what they have been told is true they praise their teachers not knowing that they really praise not teachers but learned men if the teachers really know what they express in words men are wrong when they call those teachers who are not but because very often there is no interval between the moment of speaking and the moment of knowing and because they in wardly learn immediately after the speaker has given his ad monition they suppose that they have been taught in an external fashion by him who gave the admonition 46 at another time if god permit we shall inquire into the whole problem of the usefulness of words for their usefulness properly considered is not slight now i have warned you that we must not attribute to them a greater importance than they ought to have so that now we should not only believe but also begin to understand how truly it is written by divine authority that we are to call no one on earth our teacher for one is our teacher who is in heaven cf matt 23 10 what is meant by hn heaven he will teach us by whom we are admonished through human agency and by external signs to be inwardly converted to him and so to be instructed to know and to love him is the blessed life which all proclaim that they are seeking but few have the joy of really finding but i should like you to tell me what you think of my whole discourse if you know that what i have said is true and if you had been interrogated at every point you would have answered that you knew it to be true you see then who taught you certainly not i for you would of your own accord have given the right answer each time i asked if on the other hand you do not know that what i have said is true neither i nor the inward teacher has taught you not i because thave never the power to teach anyone the teacher loi and not licj because you have not yet the power to learn ad i have learned by your warning words that by means of words a man is simply put on the alert in order that he may learn also that very little of the thought of a speaker is made evident by ms speaking i have also learned that in order to know the truth of what is spoken i must be taught by him wdio dwells within and gives me counsel about words spoken externally in the ear by his favour i shall love him the more ardently the more i advance in learning and i am specially grateful that latterly you have spoken without the interruption of questions and answers because you have taken up and resolved all the diffi culties i was prepared to urge against you you omitted nothing at all that caused me to doubt and in every case the secret oracle of which you have spoken has answered me exactly according to your words on free will augustine's review of the de liber o ar bitrio retractations f ix i while we were still delayed at rome we determined to dis cuss the question of the origin of evil the principle on which the discussion was to proceed was this we were to try if possible to let rational argument so far as we could with god’s help in our discussion demonstrate to our intellects what we already believed about the matter on divine authority after careful reasoning we agreed that evil has no other origin than in the free choice of the will so the three books which the discussion produced are called of free will of these i completed books ii and iii in africa after i had been ordained presbyter at hippo regius using such opportunity as i then could command 2 in these books many things are discussed several ques tions arose which i could not solve or which required lengthy treatment they were so broadly handled in their pros and cons that either way even when it was not quite clear where the truth lay our reasoning led to this conclusion whatever be true in these difficult matters it is to be believed or indeed it is demonstrated that god is to be praised the disputation was undertaken on account of those who deny that evil derives its origin from the free choice of the will and who contend accord ingly that god the creator of all things is to be blamed in this way following their impious error for they are manichees they seek to introduce an evil nature unchangeable and co eternal with god because this was the subject we proposed to debate there is no discussion in these books of the grace of god whereby he has predestined his elect and himself prepares the wills of those among them who make use of their freedom of choice but wheiever an occasion occurs to make mention of this grace it is mentioned in passing not laboriously defended 102 on free will 103 as if it were in question it is one thing to inquire into the origin of evil and another to seek the means of returning to man’s original good estate or even to a better one 3 wherefore do not let the pelagians exult as if i had been pleading their cause because in these books i said much in favour of free will which was necessary for the purpose i had in view in that discussion for the pelagians are a new brand of heretics who assert the freedom of the will in such a way as to leave no room for the grace of god since they say it is given to us according to our merits i have said it is true in the first book that evil doing is punished by god and i added it would not be justly punished unless it were done volun tarily again when i was showing that a good will is so great a good that it should deservedly be preferred to all material and external goods i said you see now i believe that it lies with our will whether we enjoy or lack so great and so true a good for what is more in the power of the will than the will itself he quotes a large number of similar passages to the effect that man can live aright if he will concluding with this from book iii xviii 50 who commits sin by an act which he could by no means avoid if sin has been committed therefore it could have been avoided pelagius has made use of this quota tion in one of his books and wffen i had wtitten a book in reply to his i chose as its title de natura et gratia 4 in these and similar words of mine no mention is made of the grace of god because it was not under discussion hence the pelagians think or may think that i once held their opinion but that is a vain thought certainly will is that by which a man sins or lives righteously as i argued in these w'ords but mortals cannot live righteously and piously unless the mil itself is liberated by the grace of god from the servitude to sin into w hich it has fallen and is aided to overcome its vices un less this dhane liberating gift preceded the good will it would be the reward of its merits and would not be grace which is grace precisely because it is freely given this point i have sufficiently urged in other works of mine in refutation of these recent heretics who are enemies of this grace and yet even in these books on free will wffiich were written not at all against them for they did not yet exist but against the manichees i have not been completely silent about the grace of god which in their horrible impiety they are endeavouring to abolish in the second book i said that not only great goods but even the least goods cannot be had save from him from whom re all 104 augustine earlier writings good things namely god he quotes at length ii xix 50 again i said believe with unshakable piety that you have no good which does not come from god and again since man cannot rise of his own accord as he fell by his own accord let us with strong faith hold fast the right hand of god stretched to us from above even our lord jesus christ 5 in the third book after the words which as i mentioned pelagius made use of from my book who commits sin by an act which he could by no means avoid sin has been committed therefore it could have been avoided i immediately add and yet some things are done in ignorance which are dis approved iii xviii 51 is quoted at length at the close of the next paragraph i say to approve falsehood instead of truth so as to err in spite of himself and not to be able to re frain from the works of lust because of the pain involved in breaking away from earthly bonds these do not belong to the nature of man as he was created they are the penalty of man as condemned when we speak of the freedom of the will to do right we are speaking of the freedom wherein man was created 6 you see that long before the pelagian heresy emerged i disputed as if i were already arguing against it all good things great medium and small were said to come from god free will was put among the medium goods because we can make a bad as well as a good use of it and yet it is good because we cannot live righteously without it to make a good use of it is virtue and virtue is found among the greater goods of which no one can make a bad use because all good things as i said great medium and small come from god it follows that from god also comes the good use of free will which is virtue and which is numbered among the greater goods then i go on to say that the grace of god liberates men from the misery inflicted on sinners because man was able to fall of his own accord that is by free will but was not able to rise of his own accord to the misery due to just condemnation belong the ignorance and inability which every man suffers from his birth from that evil no man is delivered save by the grace of god the pdagians will not have it that misery springs from man's just condemna tion for they deny original sin but even if ignorance and in ability did belong to man's primordial nature still god should not be blamed but praised as i argued in that same third book this thesis is to be maintained against the manichees who do not accept the holy scriptures of the old testament in which on free will 105 original sin is recorded and what is said about it in the apostolic writings they contend with detestable impudence has been interpolated by corrupters of the scriptures as if the apostles had not said it but against the pelagians we must defend what is maintained in both testaments for they profess to accept both on free will introduction i t is doubtful whether the de lihero arbitrioy at all events in its entirety is to be included among the works known to paulinas of nola in 394 and called by him augustine’s tentateuch against the manichees for we find augustine sending the three books to paulinas in 395 6 epist 31 in any case it was written against the manichees though not simply as a piece of negative polemic it is an attempt to give a reasoned answer to the question which the manichees like the gnostics sought to solve by means of an absolute dualism whence is evil the subject is in fact the nature and origin of evil but because its origin is found in the free will of the rational creation the whole work received the title it bears augustine began to write it during his short sojourn in rome on his way home to africa but he completed the second and third books after his ordination as presbyter possibly as late as 396 books i and ii which are in dialogue form appear to be properly finished in the third book the dialogue ceases abruptly at section 10 and the interlocutor seems to be quite forgotten except for a brief intervention in section 47 this fact together with the difficulty of discerning a clear and coherent plan of composition has given rise to the suggestion that this book is rather a collection of materials put together at different times it is noteworthy that particularly towards the end specifically christian doctrines are handled albeit tentatively e.g the work of christ 29 31 the effect of the sin of adam 51 54 theories of the origin of the soul 55 59 none of which is to be held obligatory occasionally too recourse is had to scripture quotation in the writer’s later manner on the 106 on free will 107 whole the de libero arbitrio may be regarded as the high water mark of his earlier works and the best and fullest exposi tion of what may be called the peculiarly augustinian brand of neoplatonism in controverting the manichees with largely platonist weapons augustine had exposed his flank to the pelagians pelagius himself was happy to be able to quote from the de libero arbitrio in support of his own views augustine’s defence is not altogether convincing viz that pelagianism had not yet emerged when he wrote and that the purpose of the work gave no occasion to speak of grace it is true enough that at the very beginning of book i he tells us that he received divine aid to enable him to escape from manichaean error and that through out free will is assumed to be a gift of god pelagius made a point of that too but the passages quoted in the retractations as showing that the de libero arbitrio is virtually anti pelagian all come from what must certainly be regarded as the later parts of the work analysis book i i i ii 5 god is believed to be both good and just can this be rationally demonstrated i evil means wrong doing suffering is the just punishment of wtong doing therefore is not evil if punishment is just the wrong doing must be voiuntar therefore god is not the author of evil 2 evil cannot be taught only how to avoid it is taught 4 5 in this inquiry we begin with faith god is omnipotent creator of all things being the absolute good god cannot be the cause of evil we seek to demonstrate our faith by reason iii 6 vi 15 the essence of wrong doing 6 7 what is the essence of evil in various deeds reputed evil not that they are condemned by law or public opinion not even that they transgress the rule not to do to others what you would not have done to yourself 9 it is something internal cupidity i.e 10 love of things one may lose un willingly i i what of killing judicially or in war which is permissible and even commanded 13 positive law reflects imperfectly a higher law 14 temporal laws are changed i08 augustine earlier writings according to circumstances but 15 reflect in this life the eternal law of reason all things must be in perfect order vii 16 xi 23 perfect order in man 16 man is superior to the beasts in possessing reason 17 rational life is better than life without reason 18 order means that the worse is subordinated to the better that reason rules the emotions 19 all men have reason though the majority may be fools when reason rules a man is wise 20 no vicious soul can overcome a virtuous soul indeed nothing can do so hence sin is voluntary and 22 man’s present state of ignorance and inability is the just penalty of voluntary sin xii 24 xiv 30 the good will 24 we accept the story of the fall in faith but how can we maintain by reason the justice of man’s present plight 25 all men wish to live rightly and to reach wisdom i.e have a good will 27 this implies possession of prudence forti tude temperance and justice and 28 happiness 29 hence the happy life is attained by simply willing to have it 30 all men wish to be happy but not all succeed this is in accord ance with the eternal law that happiness is the reward of goodness and unhappiness is the punishment of wickedness xv 31 xvi 35 temporal and eternal law 31 good men love the eternal law and obey it with pleasure bad men hate it but are subject to it and on them the tem poral law is imposed 32 temporal law regulates worldly desires so that peace and social life may be preserved it regulates temporal relationships life property kinship and citizenship it inflicts punishments which are felt as evil by men who love material things it does not punish the desire for these things but only infringements of the rights of others 33 worldly things are not evil in themselves but are not necessary for the good life 34 evil doing is neglect of eternal things and love of temporal things to the extent of becoming subject to them this is done by the free choice of the will book ii i i 6 ought god to have given man free will i free will makes sin possible but it was given that man might live righteously if he uses it badly he is justly pun ished 4 we believe that god exists and is good and that all his gifts are good 5 this is proved by the authority of on free will 109 scripture but we seek rational demonstration 6 scripture encourages this endeavour it demands faith to begin with but promises understanding three questions to be discussed i does god exist ii are all good things from him iii is free will a good thing iii 7 xv 39 proof of the existence of god 7 existence life intelligence form an ascending scale of being man excels animals in having all three 8 ff living creatures have senses wherewith they perceive corporeal ob jects they have also an interior sense which co ordinates the work of the senses and is superior to them because it is their ruler and judge 13 man alone has reason which in turn is superior to the senses and the interior sense because it judges them all 14 if there be something eternal and un changeable which is superior to reason that will be god i5 t9 the senses belong to individuals but the world per ceived by them is common to all who perceive it 20 24 so the science of number w hich has nothing to do with the senses is common to all reasoning beings who are capable of mastering it 25 27 is wisdom also common to all or are there as many wisdoms as there are wise men for men vary in their views as to what wisdom is but all agree that wisdom is a combination of truth and happiness which can not be had except in conjunction all men seek truth and happiness hence both are in a sense known to all men though they seek their supreme good in different things 28 29 there are self evident truths common to all minds general judgments of value these rules of wisdom are true and un changeable and common to all men 30 32 wisdom be longs only to rational souls but number permeates ail existing things there is some relationship between wisdom and number both are true and truth is the common property of all minds 34 ff but truth is superior to the mind because it is unchangeable and eternal we say of it that it is so not that it ought to be so possession of truth makes men happy panegyric on truth 39 truth being superior to our minds and having nothing superior to it is god the father of wisdom whose only begotten son is his equal the existence of god has been proved faith has become knowledge albeit a pale and tenuous form of knowledge xv 40 xvii 46 form and order wisdom and number are good things they pervade all created things therefore all good things come from god no augustine earlier writings xviii 47 xx 54 is free will a good thing 48 the soul is better than the body in both there are good qualities that may be abused 49 things necessary and not necessary for the good life 50 the virtues are necessary and cannot be badly used bodily goods are not necessary and can be badly used there are intermediate goods which are necessary and can be badly used e.g 52 free will which is necessary for the good life but may be used badly it may seek and cleave to the unchangeable common good or it may seek its own private good to turn from the highest good to any lower good is evil of which unhappiness is the just penalty this aversion is purely voluntary its only cause is in the will book iii i i iv ii god’s foreknowledge and man’s freedom 1 sin is a movement of the will away from unchangeable good to mutable good is this caused by natural neces.sity 2 unlike the movement of a falling stone it is voluntary and therefore culpable 4 how is this compatible with our belief in god’s foreknowledge of all things 5 that question is often asked by way of excuse by sinners 6 10 god fore knows what his creatures are going to do but does not thereby rob them of the freedom of willing foreknowledge is not coercion god is not the agent of all that he fore knows v 12 xiii 36 god is to be praised for all his creatures 12 god has made all things good in all possible and con ceivable variety but in varying degrees of excellence in ferior things are not to be grudged existence 17 mere utility from man’s point of view is no standard for measuring the value of god’s creatures we may not say that he ought to have made any of them better than he has made them 18 23 the miserable do not really wish to die existence of any kind as such is good the suicide seeks not non existence but rest 24 the universe is perfect as it is it is impious to criticize its parts 25 26 the existence of souls justly miser able contributes to that perfection unless sin had its due penalty there would be lack of order 29 31 the work of christ in delivering man by persuasion from subjection to the devil 32 ff the perfection of the universe redounds to the praise of its creator on free will iii xiii 37 xviy 46 sin is defect 38 sin is defect in an otherwise perfect nature 41 to find fault with the defect is to praise the nature in its true state 42 transience is no defect in temporal things without it the whole beauty of the temporal sequence would not be able to display itself 44 sin inevitably brings its own pen alty according to god’s law and so is compensated for in the universe as a whole 46 to attribute man’s sin to his creator is a contradiction if his sin is not his own doing it is not sin xvii 47 xxi 62 the cause of the evil will the effects of the fall 48 to ask for the cause of the evil will is to start an infinite regress 50 there can never have been compulsion else the deed was not sin but 51 there are sins due to ignorance and inability 52 man’s state of ignorance and inability is itself penal only as originally created i.e before the fall had man freedom to will and to do right 53 in addition to original sin men contract personal sins by refusing humbly to confess sin and to accept god’s proffered help 54 strictly speaking human nature means that nature as created but we also use the expression of man’s vitiated nature in its pre sent penal condition 55 60 transmission of original sin four theories of the origin of the soul but none is obligatory for christian faith 61 the origin of the soul is a fit subject for inquiry but knowledge of it is not necessary for salvation more important than the past is the goal ahead 63 no cause of sin need be looked for other than the individual will xxii 64 xxiii 70 man’s advantage even in his penal state 64 man may rise above his ignorance and inability to wis dom and righteousness to neglect to do so is sin 65 he has both the capacity and the aid of god against this optimism various objections are urged 66 f infants often die before they acquire any merit even if they are baptized but their parents faith may be imputed to them 68 ff there are the grievous sufferings of children and animals but suffering has its proper uses all elements in our experience point to the goodness of the creator xxiv 71 xxv 77 the origin of sin 71 ff man as created was neither wise nor foolish but he was rational i.e capable of receiving and understanding god’s commandment according as he obeyed or disobeyed the commandment he would become wise or foolish he ii2 augustike earlier writings became foolish by willingly making himself his own good in stead of seeking his good in god 74 ff but the will is moved by something external to itself and outwith its own power in the case of adam there was the commandment of god on the one hand and the suggestion of the devil on the other but what enticed the devil to sin simply the will perversely to imitate god he thus began to be proud then became envious and finally malevolent his eternal punishment is a warning to men on free will the text book i i i evodius tell me pray whether god be not the author of evil augustine i shall tell you if you will make it clear what you mean by evil in your question for wc are wont to use the word evil in two senses the evil a man has done and the evil he has suffered evodius i want to know about both kinds of evil augustine if you know or believe that god is good and we may not think otherwise he cannot do evil again if we confess that god is just and to deny that is sacrilegious he gives re wards to the good just as he gives punishments to the wicked but of course these punishments are evil to those who suffer them hence if no one is penalized unjustly and this we must believe seeing we believe that the universe is governed by divine providence god is not the author of the evil a man does though he is the author of the evil a man suffers ev is there then some other author of the kind of e 41 which we do not attribute to the action of god aug there certainly is for we cannot say that it happens without an author but if you ask who that is i cannot tell you for there is no one single author every evil man is the author of his evil deeds if you wonder how that is consider what we have just said evil deeds are punished by the justice of god they would not be justly punished unless they were done voluntarily 2 ep i do not know whether anyone sins without being taught to do evil if that is true i ask from whom have we learned to do wrong aug is learning a good thing jeu w ho would venture to say it was a bad thing aug perhaps it is neither good nor bad ev l think it is a good thing atig quite right at any rate if learning gives and stirs up knowledge and if it is the only path to knowledge don’t you agree that a.e.w 8 n3 ii4 augustine earlier writings this is so ev i think that nothing but good is learned by edu cation aug yet possibly evil is also learned in this way for learning disciplind is derived from the verb to learn discerel ev how then are evils committed by a man if they are not learned aug possibly because he turns away from learning and stands apart from it however that may be it is at least manifest that since learning is good evil cannot be learned if it is learned it must be a part of education and education will not be good but as you yourself admit it is good evil there fore is not learned and it is vain to ask from whom we have learned to do evil or if indeed evil is learned that can only be in the sense that we learn to avoid deeds which ought not to be done hence to do evil is nothing but to stray away from education 3 ev i think there must be two kinds of education one by which we learn to do well and one by which we learn to do evil when you asked whether education was a good thing i replied that it was because my enthusiasm for the good made me think of the education that teaches to do good now i have a sus picion that there is another kind which i have no doubt is a bad thing aug at any rate you regard intelligence as entirely a good thing ev so good indeed that a man can have nothing better i should never say that intelligence can possibly be evil aug if a man has been taught something but does not under stand it could you regard him as learned ev certainly not aug if intelligence is entirely good and is the necessary result of learning every one who learns does well and also arrives at intelligence and so again does well whoever asks for the cause of our learning anything simply asks for the cause of our doing well so do not look for any teacher of evil if he is evil he is not a teacher if he is a teacher he is not evil ii 4 ev since you force me to agree that we are not taught to do evil tell me the cause why we do evil aug that is a question that gave me great trouble when i was a young man it wearied me and drove me into the arms of heretics by that accident i was so afflicted and overwhelmed with such masses of vain fables that had not my love of finding the truth obtained divine aid i could never have found my way out or breathed the pure air of free inquiry but i took the greatest pains to find deliverance from that quandary so in discoursing with you i shall follow the order which led to my own deliver ance may god grant his aid and give us to understand what we have first believed the steps are laid down by the on free will 5 prophet who says unless ye believe ye shall not understand isa 7 9 lxx we know well that we must hold fast to that we believe that all things which exist are from one god and yet god is not the author of sins the difficulty for the mind is this if sins originate with souls which god has created and which therefore have their origin from god how are sins not to be charged against god at least mediately 5 ev now you have plainly stated the problem that was troubling my mind and which impelled me to ask my question aug have courage and hold to your faith you cannot do better than believe even when you do not know the reason for your faith to think the best of god is the truest foundation of piety and to think the best of god means to believe that he is omnipotent and absolutely unchangeable that he is the creator of all good things being himself more excellent than them all that he is the most just ruler of all that he has created that he had no assistance in creating as if he were not sufficient in himself hence he created all things of nothing one how ever he did not create but begat one equal to himself whom we call the only son of god whom we endeavour to describe more fully when we call him the power and wisdom of god by him he made all things vhich are made of nothing having stated these articles of our faith let us strive with god’s help to reach understanding of the problem which you have raised and in this fashion iii 6 you ask for the cause of our doing evil first we must discuss what doing evil is tell me what you think about this if you cannot put the whole thing briefly in a few words at least indicate your opinion by naming some evil deeds one by one ev adultery homicide sacrilege i need mention no more to enumerate all the others neither time nor my memory would be sufficient but no one doubts that those i have men tioned are examples of evil deeds aug tell me now why you think adultery is evil is it because it is forbidden by law ev it is not evil because it is forbidden by law it is forbidden by law because it is evil aug suppose someone were to press us stressing the delights of adultery and asking why it is evil and why we think it worthy of condemnation do you think that people who wanted not only to believe that adultery is evil but also to know the reason why it is so would be driven to appeal to the authority of the law you and i be lieve without die slightest hesitation that adultery is evil and i declare that all peoples and nations must believe that too but xl6 augustine earlier writings our present endeavour is to obtain intelligent knowledge and assurance of what we have accepted in faith give this matter your best consideration and tell me the reason why you know that adultery is evil ev i know it is evil because i should not wish it to be committed with my own wife whoever does to an other what he would not have done to himself does evil aug suppose someone offered his wife to another being willing that she should be corrupted by him in return for a similar licence allowed him with the other’s wife would he have done no evil ev far from that he would have done great evil aug and yet his sin does not come under your general rule for he does not do what he would not have done to him you must find another reason to prove that adultery is evil 7 ev i think it evil because i have often seen men con demned on this charge aug but are not men frequently con demned for righteous deeds without going to other books think of scripture history which excels all other books because it has divine authority if we decide that condemnation is a certain indication of evil doing what an evil opinion we must adopt of the apostles and martyrs for they were all thought worthy of condemnation for their faith if whatever is con demned is evil it was evil in those days to believe in christ and to confess the christian faith but if everything is not evil which is condemned you must find another reason for teaching that adultery is evil ev i have no reply to make 8 aug possibly the evil thing in adultery is lust so long as you look for the evil in the outward act you discover difficulties but when you understand that the evil lies in lust it becomes clear that even if a man finds no opportunity to lie with the wife of another but shows that he desires to do so and would do it if he got the chance he is no less guilty than if he were caught in the act ev nothing is more manifest and i now see that there is no need of lengthy argument to persuade me that the same is true of homicide sacrilege and all other sins for it is clear that lust alone dominates the whole realm of evil doing iv 9 aug you know that lust is also called cupidity ev l do aug do you think there is or is not a difference between cupidity and fear ev indeed there is a great differ ence between them aug i suppose you think so because cupidity longs for its object while fear avoids its object ev that is so aug what if some one kills a man from no desire to get possession of anything but from fear of suffering some evil at his hands in that case he will not be a homicide ev he on free will ii7 toii indeed even sncii a deed is not without a trace of cupidity he who kills a man from fear desires to live without fear aug and it is no small good to live without fear ev it is a great good but the homicide cannot attain it by his crime 4 i am not seeking what he can attain but what he desires cer tainly he desires a good thing who desires a life free from fear and so far his desire is not to be blamed otherwise we shall be blaming all lovers of good things so we are compelled to admit that there can be homicide in which the dominance of evil cupidity is not to be found and it wdll consequently be false to say that it is the dominance of lust which makes all sins evil in other vords there can be homicide which is not a sin ev if to kill a man is homicide it can sometimes be done without sin when a soldier kills an enemy or when a judge or an officer of the law puts a criminal to death or when a weapon slips out of someone’s hand without his will or knowledge the killing of a man does not seem to me to be a sin aug i agree but these are not usually called homicides but tell me this a slave kills his master because he feared he would be terribly tortured by him do you think he would have to be regarded as one of those who are not to be classed as homicides because they have killed a man ev his is a very different case from theirs they act in accordance with the laws or not contrary to the laws but no law approves his deed 10 aug you are reverting again to authority you must remember that we have undertaken to try to understand what we believe we believe the laws and must accordingly try if we can to understand whether the law which punishes this deed does not wrongly punish ei it does not punish wrongly when it punishes a man who willingly and knowdngly slays his master none of these other cases we have mentioned is similar aug you remember you recently said that in every evil deed lust prevailed and that for that very reason it was evil eu cer tainly i remember aug did you not also admit that he who desires to live without fear has no evil cupidity ev that too i remember aug when our slave kills his master from that motive he does so without any culpable cupidity so we have not discovered why the deed was evil we have agreed that all evil deeds are evil for no other reason than that they are com mitted from lust that is wrongful cupidity ev now it seems i must admit that he is unjustly condemned but i should not dare to say so if i had any other answer to give aug you are persuaded that so great a crime ought to go unpunished before il8 augustine earlier writings you consider whether the slave desired to be free of fear of his master in order to satisfy his own lusts to desire to live without fear is characteristic of all men not only of the good but also of the bad but there is this difference the good seek it by diverting their love from things which cannot be had without the risk of losing them the bad are anxious to enjoy these things with security and try to remove hindrances so as to live a wicked and criminal life which is better called death ev i am recovering my wits now i am glad to have learned what culpable cupidity is which we also call lust evidently it is love of things which one may lose against one’s will v 1 1 let us now inquire if you please whether lust prevails in sacrilegious acts many of which we see committed through superstition aug perhaps that would be too hasty i think we ought first to discuss whether an attacking enemy or an armed lier in wait can be slain in defence of life or liberty or chastity without any lust ev how can i possibly think that men are void of lust who fight for things which they can lose against their will if they cannot lose them what need is there to go so far as to kill a man on their account aug then the law is not just which gives the traveller authority to kill a brigand lest he should himself be killed by him or the law that allows any man or woman to slay if he can any one who comes with intent to ravish even before the crime has been committed the law also bids the soldier to slay the enemy if he abstains from killing he is punished by the general shall we dare to say that these laws are unjust or rather null and void for a law that is unjust does not seem to me to be a law at all 12 ev it is however evident that this law is well prepared against such an accusation for in the state where it is in force it auows lesser evil deeds to prevent worse being committed it is much more suitable that the man who attacks the life of another should be slain than he who defends his own life and it is much more cruel that a man should suffer violation than that the violator should be slain by his intended victim in killing an enemy the soldier is a servant of the law and can easily avoid lust in performing his duty further a law passed to guard the people cannot be accused of lust the proposer of the law if he did so at the command of god that is at the command of eternal justice could do it without the slightest trace of lust if however he did act from some motive of lust it does not follow that his law is obeyed from lust a good law can be passed by one who is not himself good for the sake of argument suppose on free will 1 19 a man has obtained tyrannical power and is prepared to make money by it suppose he accepts a bribe to bring in a law mak ing it unlawful for anyone to force a woman to become his wife the law will not be a bad law simply because the man who laid it down w as unjust and corrupt so the law which demands that hostile force be repelled by force for the purpose of protecting the citizens can be obeyed without lust and the same may be said of all officials who are law fully and in an orderly fashion subject to the powers that be and yet i do not quite see how even if the law is blameless those who obey it can be blameless for the law does not compel them to kill but leaves the decision to do so in their discretion they are free not to kill anyone for the sake of things which they can lose against their will and therefore ought not to love in matters affecting life it may be doubtful whether the soul is or is not destroyed when the body is slain if it can be destroyed it is a thing of no consequence if it cannot be destroyed there is no occasion for fear in the matter of chastity who doubts that virtue has its seat in the soul itself and cannot be snatched away by any violent violator xall that he would have robbed us of had he not been slain was outwith our jurisdiction so that i cannot see how it can be said to have been ours therefore i do not find fault with the law which permits such to be slain but i do not know how to defend those who use the permissive power to kill 13 aug much less do i know why you should seek a de fence for men wffiom no law charges with guilt ev none of the actual law's perhaps which are found in human statute books but i am not sure whether men are not bound by some more strict and secret law at any rate if divine providence ad ministers all things without exception how before that law are those free from sin who are polluted by human bloodshed on account of things which they ought to despise mind you i think that positive law designed to rule a people rightly per mits these things and vindicates divine providence the law of the state takes upon itself to vindicate all that conduces to peaceful relations between simple folk as far as it can be regu lated by man beyond that sins have other suitable penalties from which it seems to me wisdom alone can set us free atig i approve and applaud your distinction no doubt it is incomplete and far from perfect and yet it sho vs faith and high idealism you think that positive law w'hich is passed to rale states makes many concessions and leaves many things un punished which divine providence punishes and this is right 120 augustine earlier writings for what it does is not to be disapproved simply on the ground that it does not accomplish everything vi 14 but let us examine closely if you please how far evil deeds are to be punished by the law which governs states in this life then we shall consider what remains to be in evitably and secretly punished by divine providence ev that is my wish if only it is possible to reach the end of so vast a theme i think it is infinite aug be brave and enter on the path of reason trusting in piety there is nothing so hard and difficult which with god’s help will not become plain and easy depending on god and praying for his help let us persevere in our inquiry and first tell me whether the law that is promul gated in writing brings aid to men while they live this life ev manifestly for states and nations are composed of these men aug do men and peoples belong to the class of things which cannot perish or change but are altogether eternal or are they mutable and subject to time’s changes ev who can doubt that this class of things is mutable and liable to the changes of time aug if a people then is well balanced and serious minded a careful guardian of the common good if everyone in it thinks less of his private interests than of the pub lic interest it would be right to pass a law allowing that people to appoint its own magistrates to administer its affairs that is its public affairs ev quite right aug now if that same people degenerated little by little put private interests before the public interest sold its votes and corrupted by men who love honours committed rule over itself to wicked and criminal men in such a case if there existed some good and powerful man would he not be right to strip that people of the power to bestow honours and to give that power into the hands of a few good men or even of one man ev again entirely right aug these two laws are exactly contrary the one to the other the one gives to the people the power to bestow honours the other takes it away the second was passed under such condi tions that both could not exist simultaneously in one state shall we say then that one of them is unjust and ought not to have been passed ev by no means aug let us then if you please call that a temporal law which though it be just may be justly changed to suit altered circumstances ev let us so call it 15 aug what about that law which is called supreme reason which must always be obeyed by which the evil de serve an unhappy life and the good a blessed life by which the on free will i2i law we have agreed to call temporal is rightly laid down and rightly changed can any intelligent person not see that it is unchangeable and eternal can it ever be unjust that the evil should be unhappy and the good happy or that a good and serious minded people should appoint its own magistrates and that a dissolute and worthless people should be deprived of that liberty ev i sec that that is an eternal and unchangeable law aug i am sure you see also that there is nothing just or legiti mate in temporal law save what men have derived from the eternal law for if the people we have been speaking of at one time bestowed honours justly and at another time unjustly the change in question belongs to the temporal sphere but the judgment as to justice or injustice is derived from the eternal sphere in which it is abidingly just that a serious minded people should bestow honoui's and a fickle people should not don’t you agree ev i do aug briefly to express in words as best i can the idea of eternal law as it is stamped upon our minds i should say this it is just that all things should be in per fect order if you have any other view tell me ev what you say is true and i have nothing to urge against it aug since then there is one law of which all temporal laws by which men are ruled are variants that one law surely cannot vary in the least degree ev i know that is absolutely impossible no force no accident no corruption of things can ever bring it about that justice ceases to mean that all things should be in perfect order vii 1 6 aug now let us see what it means to say of a man that he is perfectly in order for a people is composed of men associated under one law a temporal law as we have said tell me whether you are quite certain that you are alive ev to no question can i give a more unhesitating reply in the affirmative aug can you distinguish living from knowing that you live ev i know that no one can know he is alive un less he is alive but i do not know whether ever oiie who is alive knows it aug how i wish you w ould believe it then you would know that beasts lack reason and our disputation would speedily pass on from that question but since you say you do not know you necessitate a long disquisition so im portant is the question and so closely knit the argument re quired that we cannot leave it aside and go on to our goal we often see beasts tamed by men not only their bodies but also their souls so that they are subject to men’s wills at a touch and by force of custom do you think that any beast however fierce 122 augustine earlier writings or huge or keen of sense could ever try in the same way to sub jugate a man to its service though many beasts could destroy man’s body by violence or in some secret way ev i agree that could not happen aug very well since it is obvious that man is far surpassed by many beasts in strength and in other bodily functions tell me how it is that man excels so that no beast can order him about as he orders many of them is it because he has what we usually call reason or intelligence ev i can think of nothing else that whereby we excel the beasts must be something in the soul since to have a living soul would make us excel dead beasts they too are living creatures animals but there is something lacking in their souls which allows them to be subjected by us and there is something in our souls that makes us better than they now no one can imagine that that is a trifle and i know no more correct word for it than reason aug you see how easy a problem becomes if god grant his aid even a problem which men think most difficult i confess i thought that the question which we have settled as i understand would have kept us as long perhaps as all the other questions we have handled since our conversation began now notice how relevant reason is to our argument i am sure you know that when we say we know we mean simply that we have grasped something by reason ev that is so aug so he who knows he is alive has reason ev that follows aug beasts are alive but as we have shown have no part in reason ev clearly aug so now you know what you said you did not know not everything which lives knows that it lives although everything that knows it lives is necessarily a living thing 1 7 ev i have no further doubts go on as you have pro posed i have clearly learned that to live is one thing and to know that one lives another thing altogether aug which of the two do you think is the better ev why of course to know that one lives aug do you think it is better to know that one lives than to have life but perhaps you understand knowledge to be a superior and purer form of life which none can know unless he has intelligence for what is to have intelligence but to live more intensely and more perfectly in the very light of the mind so unless i am mistaken you have not preferred something else to life but have preferred a better life to any kind of commonplace life ev you have exactly understood and expounded my views that is if knowledge can never be a bad thing aug it never can imless by knowledge we mean on free will 123 knowledge gained by experience experience is not always a good thing for we can experience punishments but knowledge strictly and purely so called because it is gained by reason and intelligence cannot be evil ev i grasp that difference too go on to the next subject viii 18 aug this is what i want to say whatever it is that puts man above the beasts mind or spirit perhaps it is best called by both names for we find both in the divine scrip tures whatever it is called if it dominates and rules the other parts of which man is composed then a man is most perfectly ordered we see that we have many things in common not only with the beasts but also with plants and trees for we see that trees also have power to take nourishment to grow to repro duce themselves to flourish and yet they have the lowest form of life and we observe that animals can see hear smell taste and feel corporeal objects many of them more keenly than wx can add strength vigour and firmness of limb speed and easy motion of the body in all these things we surpass some of them are the equals of others and are surpassed by not a few we also have with the animals a common attitude to external things to seek bodily pleasures and to avoid pain is the whole endeavour of animal life there are some things which do not seem to occur in animals yet they do not belong to the higher part of human nature such as jesting and laughing whoever judges rightly of human nature will hold these to be human qualities certainly but to belong to the lower part of man then there is love of praise and glor and ambition to dominate these are not characteristic of beasts and yet we must not think we are better than the beasts because we have these de sires for when such desires are not subject to reason they make us miserable no man has ever thought that his superiority con sists in a capacity for greater unhappiness when reason rules these emotions a man must be said to be well ordered there is no right order indeed there is no order at all where the better is subordinated to the worse dont you agree ev un doubtedly aug when reason or mind or spirit rules the irrational emotions then the part dominates in a man which ought to dominate according to what we have discovered to be eternal law ev i see and i follow ix 19 aug when a man is so constituted and ordered don’t you think he is wise ev i know of no other whom i could think wise if not such a man aug i suppose you know that most men are foolish ev that too i know well aug 124 augustine earlier writings if the fool is the opposite of the wise man now that we know who the wise man is you also know w ho the fool is ev evi dently he is the man in whom mind has not the chief power aug what are we to say then when a man is in that condi tion does he lack mind or does the mind he has fail to control ev the latter rather i think aug i should very much like to know what signs indicate that a man has mind even when it does not exercise its leadership ev i wish you would answer your own question for it is not easy for me to play the part you are forcing on me aug at least it is easy for you to remember what you said a moment ago beasts are made tame and gentle by men and so come to serve them men might suffer this in their turn as the argument showed if they were not somehow superior to beasts that superiority we did not find in their bodies because it was something evidently to do with their souls we found no other name for it than reason recognizing that it might also be called mind or spirit if reason and mind are different things we at least agree that only mind can make use of reason hence it is concluded that he who has reason cannot lack mind ev yes i remember that aug do you believe that the tamers of beasts must be wise men i mean by wise men those whom truth bids us call such that is those in whom mind rules and all lust is subdued and who therefore are at peace with themselves ev it is ridiculous to give that name to men who are vulgarly known as beast tamers or shepherds or ploughmen or charioteers whose work it is to tame wild animals and to make use of them when they are tamed aug there then you have a clear indication of the presence of mind in a man even when it does not rule there is mind in the men you have mentioned for they do things that could not be done without mind but mind does not rule for they are still fools and we know that there is no reign of mind except in wise men ev it is surprising that we had proved this so easily and yet i could not think what to answer x 20 but now let us go on to a further stage in the discus sion we have now found that human wisdom is the rule of the human mind but that there may be mind where it does not rule aug do you think that lust is more powerful than mind though we know that by the eternal law to mind is given rule over the lusts i cannot believe it in the least for it is not con sistent with good order that the weaker should rule the stronger i think that mind must necessarily be more powerful than cupidity simply because it is right and just that cupidity should on free will 125 be subject ev i think so too aug re we to be in any doubt that virtue is absolutely superior to vice in the sense that it is as much superior in strength and power as it is in goodness and sublimity ev who could entertain any doubtf aug then no vicious soul can overcome a soul armed with virtue ev most true aug i do not think you will deny that any kind of soul is better and more powerful than every body ed no one would deny it who sees as one easily may that a imng being is to be preferred to what is not living and that that which gives life is to be preferred to that which receives life aug much less does a body whatever its quality surpass a soul endowed with virtue ev it is self evident aug surely a just soul or a mind that keeps its proper jurisdiction and rule cannot cast down and subject to lust another mind that rules with equal justice and virtue ev by no means not only because there is the same excellence in each but also because it must first have fallen away from justice and become a vitiated mind if it attempts to make another mind vicious for that ver reason it will be weaker 21 aug you have perfectly understood the point it re mains for you to tell me if you can whether you think there is anything more excellent than a wise and rational mind ev nothing i think save god aug that is also my opinion but seeing that that is a difficult question and cannot now be suitably discussed so that we may understand it though we hold it most firmly by faith let us complete a diligent and careful treatment of the question we have on hand just now xi at present we can be sure that whatever it be that may rightly excel a mind strong in virtue it cannot be unjust in any way so that not even it though it have the power will compel a mind to serve lust ev there is no one who will not admit that wthout any hesitation aug so we are left with the conclusion that whatever is equal or superior to a ruling mind possessing virtue cannot make it serve lust because of its just character and whatever is inferior cannot do it by reason of its w eakness so our argument teaches us nothing makes the mind a companion of cupidity except its own will and free choice ev 1 see that is our necessary conclusion 2'2 aug the next step is that you must come to see that the soul justly pays the penalty for its sin ev i cannot deny that aug whzt then is it to be regarded as in itself a small penalty that the soul is dominated by lust spoiled of its resources of virtue drawn hither and thither in abject poverty now approving 126 augustine earlier writings falsehood as if it were truth now acting on the defensive now rejecting what it had formerly approved but none the less falling into other falsehoods now holding its assent back and often fearing the most obvious reasonings now despairing of ever finding the truth and sticking in the dark pit of folly now attempting to reach the light of intelligence and again falling back in sheer weariness meantime the cupidities exercise their dominion tyrannically and disturb the man’s whole mind and life with varying and contrary tempests fear on one side long ing on the other here anxiety there vain and false rejoicing here torture because something loved has been lost there eager ness to obtain what it does not possess here grief for injury suffered there incitements to seek revenge wherever it turns it can be restricted by avarice wasted by luxury bound by ambition inflated by pride tortured by envy enveloped in sloth excited by wantonness afflicted by subjection suffering all the other countless emotions which inhabit and trouble the realm of lust can we think that a condition like that is not penal when we see that it must be undergone by all who do not cleave to wisdom 23 ev i think it is indeed a terrible penalty and an alto gether just one if anybody placed on the height of wisdom should choose to descend and become a servant to lust but i am not sure whether it is actually within the power of any one who wants or is determined to do it we believe that man has been created perfect by god and has been allotted a happy life so that it is by his own will that he has fallen to the miserable condition of this mortal life but though i firmly believe this i have not yet grasped it with the intelligence if you think that diligent inquiry into this question must be postponed you do so against my will xii 24 but what worries me most is why we have to suffer such bitter penalties we who certainly are foolish and were never wise how can we be said to deserve to suffer these things as if we had deserted the fortress of virtue and chosen servitude to lust i should never consent to your postponing the attempt to discuss and solve this problem as far as you can aug you say that as if it were crystal clear that we never have been wise you are thinking only of the time since we were born into this life wisdom is a thing which exists in the soul but whether the soul lived some kind of life before its association with the body and whether it then lived with wisdom is a big question a great mystery to be considered in the proper place but the on free will 12j question we now have on hand does not prevent us from seeking an answer to it as far as that is possible 25 let me ask you have we a will ev l do not know aug do you want to know ev again i do not know aug then do not ask me any more questions ev why aug because i ought not to answer your questions unless you want to know what you ask furthermore if you do not wish to reach wisdom i ought not to hold conversation with you on matters of this kind finally you cannot be my friend unless you desire my good so far as you are concerned yourself you will have to see whether you have a will to the happy life for your self ev i agree it is impossible to deny that we have will go on and let us see what conclusion you draw from this aug so i shall but first tell me whether you are conscious of having a good will ev what is a good will aug will to live rightly and honourably and to reach the highest wisdom just see whether you do not desire to live a right and honourable life whether you do not eagerly desire to be wise or whether at least you would venture to deny that w hen we wish such things we have a good will ev i deny none of these things and accordingly admit that i have not only a will but also a good will aug what value pray do you set on such a will could you think that riches or honours or bodily pleasures or all these together are to be compared with it ev god avert such wicked madness aug are we then to rejoice a little in having something in our souls i mean a good will by comparison with which all those things we have mentioned are worthless al though we see that the mass of men refuse no toils and no dangers in order to obtain them ev we should rejoice exceedingly aug do you think that those who do not have the joy of possessing so great a good suffer only a small loss ev nay a great loss 26 aug you see then i imagine that it is in the power of our will to enjoy or to be without so great and so true a good for what is so completely within the power of the will as the will itself whoever has a good will has something w hich is far better than ail earthly realms and all bodily pleasures whoever does not have it lacks that which is more excellent than ail the goods which are not in our power and yet he can have it by willing it simply he will probably judge himself to be most miserable if he loses glory fame or immense riches or other bodily goods but won’t you think him most miserable even if he have abundance of all these things if he cleaves to things winch 128 augustine earlier writings he can easily lose and cannot have simply by willing and lacks the good will which is incomparably better than these things and though it is so great a good can yet be had simply by willing ed quite true aug rightly therefore and de servedly foolish men though they never were wise and this is doubtful and quite beyond our knowing suffer this kind of misery ev i agree xiii 27 aug now consider whether you think prudence is the knowledge of what is to be sought and avoided ev i do aug and fortitude is the disposition of soul which enables us to despise all inconveniences and the loss of things not in our power ev that is my opinion aug and temperance is a disposition that restrains our desires for things which it is base to desire don’t you agree ev i think exactly as you say aug and what shall we say justice is is it not the virtue that gives to each his own ev i have no other notion of justice aug we have spoken much of the excellence of the good will whoever has the good will and embraces it with all the love he is capable of delights himself in it enjoys it and rejoices in it knowing how great a good it is and that it can never be snatched or stolen from him against his will can we doubt that such a man will resist all that is inimical to this one good ev he will offer all resistance aug can we think that a man has not prudence who sees that this good is to be sought and those things avoided which are inimical to it ev no one i think could do so without prudence aug quite right but why should we not also attribute fortitude to him he cannot love and set great store by things which are not in his power the evil will loves these things and he must necessarily resist it as the enemy of his dearest good he does not love them nor grieve when he loses them but contemns them all and this we have agi'eed is the function of fortitude ev let us indeed attribute this virtue to him i know of no one to whom i may more truly attribute courage than the man who can with a calm and tranquil mind bear the loss of things which it is not in his power either to obtain or to keep this we have found he necessarily does aug can we refuse to allow that he has temperance since that is the virtue which restrains lusts what is more hostile to the good will than lust hence you can under stand that the lover of the good will resists and opposes lusts in every way and so is rightly called temperate ev go on for i agree aug there remains justice but i do not see how it can be lacking in such a man he who has and loves the good on free will 129 will and resists v hat is hostile to it cannot will any e 41 to any body it follows that he injures nobody which must mean simply that he gives to ever one his due this i said was the function of justice and i dare say you remember you agreed ev i remember and i agree that we have shown that the four virtues which you described with my consent are found in the man who loves his good will and values it highly 28 aug is there any reason why we should not allow that such a man’s life is laudable eu no reason at all every thing encourages us or even compels us to do so aug can you by any means suppose that the unhappy life is not to be avoided ev most certainly it must be avoided that i hold to be our first duty aug and of course what is laudable is not to be avoided ev no indeed it is to be most carefully sought after aug the laudable life therefore is not unhappy ev that follows aug you will have no difficulty now in admitting that a life which is not unhappy is the happy life ev clearly aug we agree then that the man is happy who loves the will and in comparison with it scorns everything else that is called good which can be lost even when the will to retain it remains ev we must agi'ee since this is the necessary conclusion from our argument aug you are perfectly right but tell me to love the good will and to hold it in high esteem is that not simply to have a good will ev true aug if we are right in judging this man happy must we not rightly judge him unhappy who has a different kind of will ev quite correct aug why then should we think it doubtful even if we have never been wise formerly that by the exercise of will we deserve and live either a laudable and happy life or a base and unhappy one ev i agree that we have reached this result by arguments that are certain and undeniable 29 aug take this further question i believe you remember how we defined the good will it was the power by which we seek to live rightly and honourably ev i remember aug if we love and embrace this good will and prefer it to all the things which we cannot retain by willing those wtues as we have learned by our argument which together constitute right and honourable living dwell in our souls hence it follows that whoever wishes to live rightly and honourably if he prefers that before all fugitive and transient goods attains his object with perfect ease in order to attain it he has to do nothing but to will it ev truly i can hardly refrain from shouting for joy when i find i can so quickly and so easily obtain so great a good a.e.w 9 130 augustine earlier writings this very joy which comes from attaining this good especially when it keeps the mind calm and tranquil and stable is what we call the happy life unless you think that to live happily is something else than to rejoice in good things that are both true and certain that is what i think xiv 30 aug very well but do you think there is a single man who does not in every possible way will and choose the happy life fv who doubts that that is what every man wishes aug why then do not all obtain it we agreed that men by the use they make of their wills deserve either a happy or an unhappy life and receive what they deserve but now some opposition has arisen which unless we examine it closely threatens to throw our previous argument into confusion though we thought it strong and carefully constructed how has anyone to endure an unhappy life because of the use he has made of his will when no one at all wills to live unhappily or how does any man attain by the use of his will a happy life seeing that all wish to be happy and so many are unhappy is it because there are two different kinds of willing a good and a bad or is there a difference between deserving by using a good will and deserving by using a bad will for those who are happy and they must also be good are not happy simply because they wish to live happily the bad also have the same wish they are happy because they live rightly which the bad do not wish to do it is not surprising that unhappy men do not obtain what they wish that is a happy life for they do not at the same time wish its accompaniment without which no one is worthy of it and no one obtains it that is to say a righteous life the eternal law to the consideration of which we must now return has established firmly and unchangeably that merit accrues from willing and that happiness is the reward of good ness and unhappiness the punishment of badness so when we say that men are unhappy voluntarily we do not mean that they want to be unhappy but that their wills are in such a state that unhappiness must follow even against their will so it is not inconsistent with our previous reasoning that all men wish to be happy but cannot be for all do not wish to live aright and it is that wish that merits the happy life have you anything to say against that fv i have nothing xv 31 but let us see how all this applies to the question raised concerning the two laws aug let us do so but first tell me whether he who loves to live aright and delights in it so that he finds it not merely right but also sweet and pleasant so on free will 13i to live will love and cherish the law which he knows awards the happy life to the good will and an unhappy life to the evil will ed he will be entirely devoted to it for he directs his life according to its terms aug in loving it does he love something changeable and temporal or something stable and eternal ev something certainly eternal and unchangeable aug those who continue in an evil will no less desire to be happy but can they love the law which deserredly allots un happiness to such people ev i should think not at all aug do they love anything else ev yes indeed many other things they love the things which the evil will steadfastly seeks to ob tain and keep aug i suppose you mean wealth honours pleasures bodily beauty and all the other things which it is possible not to obtain though they are desired and which may be lost against one's will ev these are the things i mean aug you do not imagine these things are eternal since you see they are involved in the flux of time ev it would be utter madness to imagine that aug it is therefore manifest that some men are lovers of eternal things others of temporal things and we have agreed that there are two laws one eternal and the other temporal now assuming that you have a sense of justice which of these two classes of men would you hold was obedient to the eternal law and w hich to the temporal law ev the answer is obvious i think those who are happy on account of their love of eternal things i hold act under obedience to the eternal law while on unhappy men the temporal law is im posed aug you are perfectly right so long as you hold firmly what reason has clearly demonstrated that those who serve the temporal law cannot be set free from subjection to the eternal law for from the eternal law are derived all just laws even when they are variable according to circumstances as we have said but those who with a good will cleave to the eternal law do not need the temporal law as apparently you well understand ev i see your point 32 42 the eternal law bids us turn our love away from temporal things to cleanse it and turn it towards eternal things ev lt does what then does the temporal law bid us do is it not that men may possess the things which may be called ours for a season and which they eagerly covet on condition that peace and human society be preserved so far as they can be preserv ed in earthly things these are first the body and bodily goods such as good health keenness of the senses strength beauty and anything else that may be necessary augustine earlier writings 132 for the good arts of life which are to be more highly valued than those which are of less value and importance next comes liberty of course there is no true liberty except the liberty of the happy who cleave to the eternal law but for the moment i mean the liberty which people think they enjoy when they have no human masters and which slaves desire who wish to be manumitted by their human masters then parents brothers wife children kinsfolk near and remote friends and any others who may be attached to us by any bond then our citizenship which is usually reckoned from the home of our parents to gether with honours and praise and popular glory as it is called finally there is money which in one word covers all that we lawfully possess and which we have the right to dispose of by sale or gift to explain how in all these matters the law dis tributes to each his due would be difficult and would take a long time but clearly it is not necessary to our purpose it is suffi cient to see that the authority of this law in punishing does not go beyond depriving him who is punished of these things or of some of them it employs fear as an instrument of coercion and bends to its own ends the minds of the unhappy people to rule whom it is adapted so long as they fear to lose these earthly goods they observe in using them a certain moderation suited to maintain in being a city such as can be composed of such men the sin of loving these things is not punished what is punished is the wrong done to others when their rights are infringed have we not accomplished a task which you thought would be in finite for we set out to inquire how far the law which governs earthly peoples and citi may rightly punish ev i see we have accomplished our task 33 aug you see also that there would be no punishment inflicted on men either by injury done them or by legal sentence if they did not love the things that can be taken from them against their will ev i see that aug some use these things badly some use them well he who uses them badly is he who lovingly cleaves to them and is completely involved in them he subjects himself to things which he ought to make subject to himself and sets before himself as his chief goods those things which he ought to subordinate and handle properly and so be come good himself he who uses them aright shows that they are good but not in themselves they do not make him good or better but are made good by the use he puts them to he is not attached to them by love making them parts of his soul as is done by loving them lest when they begin to be taken from on free will 33 him he suffer torture and decay he wholly transcends them and is prepared to possess and regulate them when necessary but is even better prepared to lose them and be without them since this is so you will not blame gold and silver because there are avaricious people or food because there are gluttons or wine because there are drunkards or female beauty because there are fornicators and adulterers and so on after all you can see that a doctor may make a good use of fire and a poisoner may make a wicked use of bread ev very true the things are not to be blamed but the men who make a bad use of them xvi 34 aug quite right we begin to see now i think the force of the eternal law and how far the temporal law can go in punishing we have also discovered we have made a sufficiently clear distinction between two classes of things the eternal and the temporal and between two classes of men those who love and pursue eternal things and those who pursue temporal things what each one chooses to pursue and embrace is within the power of his will to determine vill alone can drive the mind from its seat of authority and from the right course and it is manifest that when anyone uses anything badly it is not the thing but the man who uses it badly that is to be blamed now if you please let us refer back to the question proposed at the beginning of this conversation and see whether it has been answered we set out to inquire what doing evil means and all we have subsequently said has a bearing on this now we may give our minds to consider whether doing evil is anything else than to neglect eternal things which the mind itself perceives and enjoys and loves and cannot lose and to pursue as if they were great and wonderful temporal things which are per ceived by the body the lowest part of human nature and can never be possessed with complete certainty for in this class it seems to me all evil deeds that is sins are to be included i am waiting for you to tell me what you think 35 ed it is as you say i agree that all sins are included in this one class viz turning away from things which are divine and truly abiding and turning to things which are changeable and uncertain they are right enough in their own place and have a certain beauty of their own but it is the mark of a perverse and disordered mind to pursue them to the point of becoming subject to them for rightly by divine ordinance the mind is set over them and ought to bear absolute rule over them at the same time it seems to me our other question has been fully answered for after asking what doing evil means we set out to 134 augustine earlier writings inquire what was the cause of evil doing unless i am mistaken reason has demonstrated that we do it by the free choice of our will but i ask now whether our maker ought to have given us free will seeing it is proved to be the source of our capacity to sin if we had not had it apparently we should not have sinned it is to be feared that in this way god may be held to be the author of our ill doing aug have no fear of that but another time must be found to go into the question thoroughly an end must now be put to this conversation in which i hope you realize that we have knocked at the door of some important and recondite matters of inquiry when we begin to enter their in most chambers with god’s aid you will certainly be able to judge how great a difference there is between this disputation and those which are to follow and how much superior they are not only in the sagacity required for their investigation but also in the majesty of the subjects and the bright light of truth only let piety attend us that by divine providence we may be permitted to hold to and complete the course on which we have set out v i accept your decision and to it and to your prayer i most willingly add my own book ii i i evodius now explain to me if it can be done why god has given man free choice in willing for if he had not received that freedom he would not have been able to sin augustine you hold it to be certainly known that it is god who has given man this power which you think ought not to have been given ev my impression is that we learned in the earlier book both that we have free will and that our sinning is due to it aug i too remember that that became manifest to us but now my question was whether you know that god gave us this power which we clearly have and which is the cause of our sinning ev no one else could have done so i think for we derive our origin from him and from him we merit punishment or reward according as we sin or act rightly aug here is another thing i desire to know do you know this quite distinctly or do you merely believe it without knowing it because you allow yourself to be influenced by authority ev undoubtedly i was first brought to believe this on the ground of authority but what can be more true than to say that every good thing is from god that justice is entirely good and that it is just that sinners should be punished and well doers rewarded hence it follows on free will i35 that it is by god that sinners are made unhappy and well doers happy 2 aug i am not objecting but i ask the question how do you know that we derive our origin from god you have not explained this though you have explained how we merit punish ment or reward at his hand ev if it is accepted that god punishes sins as it must be if it is true that all justice has its source in him this alone would prove that we derive our origin from him no doubt it is the characteristic of goodness to confer benefits on strangers but it is not similarly the mark of justice to punish sins in those who are not under its immediate juris diction hence it is clear that we belong to him because he is not only most kind in conferring benefits upon us but also most just in his punishments moreover from the statement i made and you accepted that every good thing comes from god it can be known that man also comes from god for man in so far as he is man is good because he can live aright if lie chooses to do so 3 aug clearly if this is so the problem you have posed is solved if man is good and if he would not be able to act rightly except by willing to do so he ought to have free will because without it he would not be able to act rightly because he also sins through having free will we are not to believe that god gave it to him for that purpose it is therefore a sufficient reason why he ought to have been given it that without it man could not live aright that it was given for this purpose can be understood from this fact if anyone uses his free will in order to sin god punishes him that would be unjust unless the will was free not only to live aright but also to sin how could he be justly punished who uses his will for the purpose for which it was given now when god punishes a sinner what else do you suppose he will say to him than why did you not use your free will for the purpose for which i gave it to you that is in order to do right justice is praised as a good thing because it con demns sins and honours righteous actions how could that be done if man had not free will an action would be neither sinful nor righteous unless it were done voluntarily for the same reason both punishment and reward would be unjust if man did not have free will but in punishing and in rewarding there must have been justice since justice is one of the good things which come from god god therefore must have given and ought to have given man free will ii 4 ev i admit now that god has given us free will but 136 augustine earlier writings don’t you thinkj pray that if it was given for the purpose of well doing it ought not to have been possible to convert it to sinful uses justice itself was given to man so that he might live rightly and it is not possible for anyone to live an evil life by means of justice so no one ought to be able to sin voluntarily if free will was given that we might live aright aug god will i hope give me ability to answer you or rather will give you the ability to answer your own question truth which is the best master of all will inwardly teach us both alike but i wish you would tell me this i asked you whether you know with perfect certainty that god has given us free will and you replied that you did now if we allow that god gave it ought we to say that he ought not to have given it if it is uncertain whether he gave it we rightly ask whether it was good that it was given if then we find that it was good we find also that it was given by him who bestows all good things on men if however we find that it was not a good thing we know that it was not given by him whom it is impious to accuse if it is certain that he has given it we ought to confess that however it was given it was rightly given we may not say that it ought not to have been given or that it ought to have been given in some other way if he has given it his action cannot in any way be rightly blamed 5 ev i believe all that unshakably nevertheless because i do not know it let us inquire as if it were all uncertain i see that because it is uncertain whether free will was given that men might do right since by it we can also sin another uncertainty arises namely whether free will ought to have been given to us if it is uncertain that it was given that we should act righteously it is also uncertain that it ought to have been given at all hence it will also be uncertain whether it was god who gave it if it is uncertain that it ought to have been given it is uncertain that it was given by him whom it is impious to believe has given anything which ought not to have been given aug at any rate you are quite certain that god exists i firmly believe it but i do not know it aug we read in scripture the fool hath said in his heart there is no god ps 52 18 if such a fool were to say to you there is no god and would not believe as you do but wanted to know whether what you believe is true would you simply go away and leave him or would you think it your duty somehow to try to persuade him that what you believe is true especially if he were really eager to know and not merely to argue obstinately ev your last proviso tells me what i ought to reply to him however absurd he might on free wili 37 be he would assuredly agree that one ought not to dispute with an insidious and obstinate opponent about anything at all least of all about a matter so important he would admit that and to get me to believe that his inquiry was made in all good faith and that in this matter there was neither guile nor obstinacy in him then i would use an argument that ought to carry great weight with any fair minded person i should show him that just as he wants his neighbour to believe him when he tells of the thoughts of his mind which he of course knows but which are quite concealed from his neighbour so he ought to believe that god exists because that is taught in the books of great men who have left their testimony in writing that tliey lived with the son of god and because they have written that they saw things which could not have happened if there were no god i should urge that he would be very foolish to blame me for believing them when he wanted me to beiic c himself and when he saw that he had no good ground for finding fault with me he would find no reason for refusing to imitate my faith if you think the existence of god is sufficiently proved by the fact that we judge it not to be rash to believe the scripturc wtiters why don’t you think we should similarly trust their authority in the matters we have begun to investigate as if they were uncertain or quite beyond our knowledge so we should be spared much labour in investigation eu yes but we want to know and to understand what we believe 6 aug you remember the position we adopted at the beginning of our former discussion we cannot deny that be lieving and knowing are different tilings and that in matters of great importance pertaining to divinity wc must first believe before we seek to know otheiwise the words of the prophet would be vain where he says except ye believ'e ye shall not understand isa 7 9 lxx our lord himself both in his words and by his deeds exhorted those whom he called to salv a tion first of all to believe when he afterwards spoke of the gift that was to be given to believers he said not this is life eternal that they may believe but this is life eternal that they may know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent john 17 3 to those who already believed he said seek and ye shall find matt 7 7 he cannot be said to have found who merely believes what he does not know and no one is fit to find god who docs not first believe what lie will after wards learn to know wherefore in obedience to the precepts of the lord let us press on in our inquiry what we seek at ms 138 atjgustine earlier writings bidding we shall find as far as that can be done in this life and by people such as we are and he himself will demonstrate it to us we must believe that these things are perceived and possessed by people of superior character even while they dwell on earth and certainly more clearly and perfectly by all the good and pious after this life so we must hope it will be with us and despising earthly and human things we must in every way desire and love heavenly things iii 7 let us discuss these three questions if you please and in this order first how it is manifest that god exists secondly whether all good things in so far as they are good are from him lastly whether free will is to be counted among the good things when these questions have been answered it will i think be evident whether free will has been rightly given to man first then to begin with what is most obvious i ask you do you exist are you perhaps afraid to be deceived by that question but if you did not exist it would be impossible for you to be de ceived ev proceed to your other questions aug since it is manifest that you exist and that you could not know it unless you were living it is also manifest that you live you know these two things are absolutely true ev i do aug therefore this third fact is likewise manifest namely that you have intelli gence ev clearly aug of these three things which is most excellent ev intelligence aug why do you think so ev to exist to live and to know are three things a stone exists but does not live an animal lives but has not intelligence but he who has intelligence most certainly both exists and lives hence i do not hesitate to judge that that is more excellent which has all these qualities than that in which one or both of them is absent that which lives thereby exists but it does not follow that it has also intelligence that is a life like that of an animal that which exists does not necessarily have either life or intelli gence dead bodies must be said to exist but cannot be said to live much less can that which has not life have intelligence aug we gather therefore that of these three things a dead body lacks two an animal one and man none ev that is true aug and of these three things that is most excellent which man has along with the other two that is intelligence having that it follows that he has both being and life ev i am sure of that 8 aug tell me now whether you know that you have these common bodily senses seeing hearing smelling taste touch ev yes i know aug what do you think belongs to the sense a.e.w 10 on free will 39 of sightj that is what do we sense by seeing ev corporeal objects aug do w e perceive hardness and softness by seeing ev no what then belongs properly to the function of the eyes to perceive ev colour aug and to the ears ev sound aug to the sense of smell ev odour to the sense of taste ev taste aug to the sense of touch ev the soft and the hard the smooth and the rough and many such things aug the forms of corporeal objects great and small square and round and such like qualities we perceive both by sight and touch and so they cannot be ascribed solely to either sight or touch but to both ev i understand aug you understand then that some things belong to one particular sense whose function it is to convey information about them wliile other things belong in this way to several senses ev that also i understand aug can we by any of the senses decide what belongs to any particular sense or what belongs to all or several of them together ev by no means that has to be decided by something else within us aug perhaps that would be reason which the beasts lack for i suppose it is by reason that we comprehend sense data and know that they are as they are ev rather i think that by reason we comprehend that there is a kind of interior sense to which the ordinary senses refer everything for in the case of the beast the sense of sight is a different thing from the sense to shun or to seek the things it sees the former belongs to the eyes the latter is within the soul itself for of the things they see or hear or perceive with the other bodily senses some the animals seek with pleasure and accept others they avoid as displeasing and refuse to take this sense can be called neither sight nor hearing nor smell nor taste nor touch but must be some other sense which presides over all the others alike while we comprehend this by reason as i said still we cannot call it reason since clearly the beasts have it too 9 aug i recognize that there is that faculty and i do not hesitate to call it the interior sense but unless the information conveyed to us by the bodily senses goes beyond that sense it cannot become knowledge what we know we comprehend by reason we know that colours are not perceived by hearing nor voices by seeing to mention these only when we know this it is not by means of the eyes or the ears or by that interior sense which the beasts also possess we cannot believe that they know that light is not perceived by the ears nor voices by the eyes for we do not discern these things without rational observation 140 augustine earlier writings and thought ev i cannot say that i quite see that suppose they do distinguish by the interior sense which you admit the animals have and realize that colours cannot be perceived by hearing nor voices by seeing aug you do not suppose that they can distinguish between the colour that is seen the sense that is in the eyes the interior sense that is in the soul and the reason by which all these things are defined and enumerated not at all aug could reason distinguish these four things and define their limits unless the notion of colour were conveyed to it in these various stages first the sense of sight in the eyes would report to the interior sense which presides over all the external senses and it would then report direct to reason that is to say if there is no intermediate stage ev i see no other way aug the sense of sight perceives colour but is itself perceived by no other sense do you see that you do not see sight with the same sense as you see colour ev certainly not aug try to distinguish these two things for i suppose you do not deny that colour is one thing and to see colour is another entirely different thing moreover it is another different thing to have the sense that enables us to see colour as if it were before us even when in actual fact there is no colour before us ev i distinguish these things and admit that they are all different aug well take these three things do you see anything with the eyes except colour ev nothing else aug tell me then how you see the other two things for you cannot distinguish between them if you have not seen them ev i know no way i know it is so that is all aug so you do not know whether it is by reason or by what we call the interior sense which presides over the bodily senses or by something else ev i do not know aug and yet you know that they can be defined only by reason and that reason could not do this unless sense data were offered for its examination ev that is certain aug then all in the act of knowing which does not come from sense perception is provided by reason to which are reported and referred all external circumstances and so sense data can be accepted but strictly within their own limits and can be com prehended not by sense only but also by knowledge ev that is so aug reason distinguishes the senses which are its ser vants from the data they collect likewise it knows the differ ence between the senses and itself and is sure that it is much more powerful than they does reason comprehend reason by any other means than by reason itself would you know that you possess reason otherwise than by reason ev surely not on free will i4i aug when we see a colour we do notj with the sense of sight see that we see when wc hear a sound we do not hear our hearing when we smeil a rose wx do not smell our smelling w’hen we taste anything we do not taste taste in our mouths and when we touch anything we cannot touch the sense of touch it is clear therefore that none of the five senses can perceive itself though all in their several ways perceive corporeal ob jects ev that is quite clear iv 10 aug i think it is also clear that the interior sense perceives not only the data passed on to it by the five senses but also perceives the senses too a beast would not make the move ment neccssar for seeking or avoiding anything unless it was conscious of perceiving which of course it could not be by using the five senses only i do not suggest that this consciousness in the beast is a step towards knowledge for that belongs to reason simply that it is a prerequisite of movement if there is still some obscurity here an example will elucidate the point it will be enough to consider the case of one of the senses say sight a beast would be quite unable to open its eyes and direct them towards an object it desired to see unless it perceived that it could not see the object so long as its eyes were closed and not directed to the object if it is conscious of not seeing when it does not see it must also be conscious of seeing when it does see the fact that when it sees an object it does not make the movement that would be necessars to bring it into view indicates that it perceives that it sees or does not see but it is not so clear whether a beast has self consciousness as w ell as consciousness of perceiving corporeal objects possibly it has an inward feeling that every living thing shuns death which is the opposite of life if so every living thing w'hich shuns the opposite of life must be conscious of itself as living but if that is not clear let us omit it and not strive to establish our position with proofs that are not both certain and self evident what is evident is this corporeal objects are perceived by bodily sense no bodily sense can per ceive itself the interior sense can perceive both corporeal ob jects perceived by a bodily sense and also that bodily sense itself but reason knows all these things and knows itself and therefore has knowledge in the strict sense of the term i on’t you think so ev i do indeed aug come then what about the question the answer to which we desired to reach to reach that answer we have taken ail this time and trouble in preparing the way vj ii ev so far as i remember of the three questions we 142 augustine earlier writings formulated to give the discussion some order we are now en gaged with the first namely how is it to be made evident that god exists a proposition which is most firmly to be accepted in faith aug you are quite right but i want you to keep firm hold of this too when i asked you whether you know that you exist it appeared that you know not only this but two other things as well ev i remember that too aug now to which of the three do you understand all that impinges on the bodily senses to pertain i mean in which class of things would you put all that we perceive by means of the eyes or any other bodily organ would you say that all this belongs to the class that merely exists or to that which also has life or to that which has intelligence as well ev in that which merely exists aug and where would you put the senses eu in that which has life aug and which do you judge to be superior the senses or their objects ev the senses surely aug why ev because that which has life is superior to what merely exists 12 aug what about the interior sense which we have dis covered to be inferior to reason and possessed by us in common with the beasts do you have any hesitation in putting it higher than the senses by means of which we come into contact with corporeal objects and which you have said are to be reckoned superior to corporeal objects ev i should have no hesitation aug i should like to know why not you cannot say that the interior sense is to be placed in the category of intelligent things for it is found in beasts which have no intelli gence this being so i ask why you put the interior sense higher than the senses which perceive corporeal objects since both belong to the class of things that have life you put the bodily senses above corporeal objects just because they belong to the kind of things which merely exist while it belongs to the kind which also live so also does the interior sense tell me then why you think it superior if you say it is because the interior sense perceives the other senses i do not believe you will be able to find a rule by which we can establish that every per ceiving thing is superior to what it perceives that would mean that we should be compelled to say that every intelligence is superior to that which it knows but that is false for man knows wisdom but is not superior to wisdom wherefore consider for what reason you think that the interior sense is superior to the senses by which we perceive corporeal objects ev it is be cause i recognize that it is in some kind of way a ruler and judge among the other senses if they failed in their duty it on free will 143 would be like a master demanding a debt from a seiwant as we just recently were saying the eye cannot see whether it has vision or not and therefore it cannot judge where it is defective or where it is sufficient that is what the interior sense does as when it teaches a beast to open its eyes and supply what it per ceives is lacking no one doubts that he who judges is superior to that over which he exercises judgment aug you observe then that a bodily sense also judges in a manner corporeal ob jects pleasure and pain fall within its jurisdiction when the body is affected gently or harshly just as the interior sense judges whether the sight of the eyes is defective or adequate so sight judges what is defective or adequate in colours just as the interior sense judges of our hearing whether it is sufficient or defective so the sense of hearing judges voices whether they flow smoothly or are noisily harsh we need not go over the other senses you observe already i think what i wish to say the interior sense judges the bodily senses approving their integrity and demanding that they do their duty just as the bodily senses judge corporeal objects approving of gentleness and reproving the opposite ei i see that and agree that it is true vi 13 aug now consider whether reason also judges of the interior sense i am not asking whether you have any doubts as to its superiority for i have no doubt that you judge it to be superior nor perhaps is it worth inquiring whether reason judges of the interior sense for about those things which are inferior to reason that is about corporeal objects bodily senses and the interior sense reason alone tells us how one is superior to another and how reason is more excellent than them all how could it do so if it were not a judge over them ev that is obvious aug a nature which not only exists but also lives like that of the beast though it have not intelligence is higher than a nature which merely exists and has no life like an inanimate object and higher still is a nature which exists and lives and has intelligence like the rational mind in man surely you do not think that in us that is in a complete human nature anything can be found more excellent than that which we have put third among these three levels of being obviously we have a body and life which animates the body these two things we recognize that beasts also have but there is a third thing the head as it were or the eye of our soul or whatever else more fitly describes reason and intelligence which beasts do not have can you i pray find anything in human nature higher than reason ev i see nothing at all that could be superior x4 4 augustine earlier writings 14 aug if now we could find something which you could unhesitatingly recognize not only as existing but also as superior to our reason would you have any hesitation in calling it what ever it may be god ev well i should not without hesitation give the name god to anything that i might find better than the best element in my natural composition i do not wish to say simply that god is that to which my reason is inferior but that above which there is no superior aug clearly so for it is god who has given to your reason to have these true and pious views of him but i ask supposing you find nothing superior to our reason save what is eternal and unchangeable will you hesitate to call that god you realize that bodies are mutable and it is evident that life which animates the body is not without mutability by reason of its varying affections even reason is proved to be mutable for sometimes it strives to reach the truth and sometimes it does not so strive sometimes it reaches the truth and sometimes it does not if without the aid of any bodily organ neither by touch nor by taste nor by smell neither by the ears nor the eyes but by itself alone reason catches sight of that which is eternal and unchangeable it must confess its own inferiority and that the eternal and unchange able is its god ev this i will certainly confess to be god than whom there is nothing superior aug very well it will be enough for me to show that there is something of this nature which you will be ready to confess to be god or if there be something higher still that at least you will allow to be god however that may be it will be evident that god exists when with his aid i have demonstrated to you as i promised that there is something above reason ev then proceed with your demonstration as you promise vii 15 aug i shall do so but i first ask you this is my bodily sense identical with yours or is mine mine and yours yours only if the latter were not the case i should not be able to see anything with my eyes which you also would not see ev i admit that at once though while each of us has severally the senses of sight hearing and the rest your senses and mine belong to the same class of things for one man can both see and hear what another does not see or hear and with any of the other senses can perceive what another does not perceive hence it is evident that your sense is yours alone and mine mine alone aug will you make the same reply about the interior sense ev exactly my interior sense perceives my perceiving and yours perceives yours often someone who sees something will on free will 145 ask me wlietlier i also see it the reason for asking simply is that i know whether i see or not and the questioner does not know has each of us then his own particular reason for it can often happen that i know something when you do not know it and i know that i know it but you cannot know that apparently eacli of us has his own private rational mind 1 6 aug but you cannot say that each of us has his own private sun or moon or stars or the like though each of us sees these things with his own particular sense of sight ei no of course i would not say that aug so many of us can sec one thing simultaneously though our senses by which we perceive the object we all see together arc our own in spite of the fact that my sense and yours are two different things what we actually see need not be two different things one of which i see while you see the other there is one object for both of us and both of us see it simultaneously ei obviously aug we can also hear one voice simultaneously so that though niy hearing is not your hearing there are not two voices of which you hear one and i another it is not as if my hearing caught one part of the sound and yours another the one sound and the w hole of it is heard by both of us simultaneously ev that too is obvious 17 aug but notice please what is to be said about the other senses it is pertinent to the present discussion to obseiwe that the case with them is not quite the same as with sight and hearing though it is not entirely different you and i can breathe the same air and feel its effects by smelling likewise we can both partake of one piece of honey or some other food or drink and feel its effects by tasting that is to say there is one object but we each have our own senses you have yours and i have mine so while we both sense one odour and one taste you do not sense it with my sense nor i with yours nor with any sense that we can have in common imy sense is entirely mine and yours yours even though both of us sense the same odour or the same taste in this way these senses some what resemble sight and hearing but there is this dissimilarity which is pertinent to tlie present problem wc both breathe the same air with our nostrils and taste one food and yet i do not breathe in the same particles of air as you do and i consume a different portion of food from that consumed by you when i breathe i draw in as much air as is sufficient for me and when you breathe you draw in as much as is sufficient for you but both of us use different parts of air if bet veen us we consume 146 augustine earlier writings one food the whole of it is not consumed either by you or by me as we both hear the whole sound of a word spoken or see the whole object offered to our sight simultaneously one part of a drink must pass into your mouth and another into mine do you understand ev i admit that is all clear and certain 18 aug do you think the sense of touch is comparable to the senses of sight and hearing in the fashion we are now dis cussing not only can we both feel one body by touching it but we can both feel not only the same body but the same part of it it is not as in the case of food where both of us cannot consume the whole of it when we both eat it you can touch what i touch and touch the whole of it we do not touch each one a different part but each of us touches the whole ev so far i admit that the sense of touch resembles the first two senses sight and hearing but i see there is this difference we can both simul taneously at one and the same time see or hear the whole of what is seen or heard no doubt we can both touch simul taneously the whole of one object but in any one moment we can only touch different parts the same part we can only touch at different times i cannot touch the part you are touch ing unless you move away your hand 19 aug you are most vigilant but here is another thing you ought to notice since there are some things which both of us can feel and others which we must feel severally our own senses for example we must feel each for himself i cannot feel your sense nor you mine but in the case of corporeal things that is things we perceive with the bodily senses when we cannot both perceive them together but must do so severally it is due to the fact that we make them completely ours by con suming them and making them part of ourselves like food and drink of which you cannot consume the same part as i do it is true that nurses give infants food which they have chewed but the part which has been squeezed out and been swallowed can not be recalled and used to feed the child when the palate tastes something pleasant it claims a part even if only a small part which it cannot give up and does with it what is con sonant with corporeal nature were this not so no taste would remain in the mouth when what had been chewed was put out the same can be said of the part of the air which we draw into our nostrils you may breathe in some of the air which i breathe out but you cannot breathe that part which has gone to nourish me for i cannot breathe it out physicians sometimes bid us take medicine through our nostrils i alone feel it when i on free will 147 breathe it in and i cannot put it back again by breathing out so that you may breathe it in and feel it all sensible things which we do not destroy and take into our systems when we sense them we can perceive both of us cither at the same time or at different times one after the other in such a way that the whole or the part which i perceive can also be perceived by you i mean such things as light or sound or bodily objects which we do not destroy when we use and perceive them ed understand aug it is therefore evident that things which we perceive with the bodily senses without causing them to change are by nature quite different from our senses and consequently are common to us both because they are not con verted and changed into something which is our peculiar and almost private property ev l agree aug by our peculiar and private property 1 mean that which belongs to each of us alone which each of us perceives by himself alone which is part of the natural being of each of us severally by common and almost public property i mean that which is perceived by all sentient beings without its being thereby affected and changed ed that is so viii 20 aug now consider carefully and tell me whether anything can be found which all reasoning beings can see in common each with his own mind and reason something which is present for all to see but which is not transformed like food and drink for the use of those for whom it is present something which remains complete and unchanged whether they see it or do not see it do you perhaps think there is nothing of that kind ev indeed i see many such but it will be sufficient to mention one the science of numbers is there for all reasoning persons so that all calculators may try to learn it each with his own reason and intelligence one can do it easily another with difficulty another cannot do it at all but the science itself remains the same for everybody who can learn it nor is it con verted into something consumed like food by him who learns it if anyone makes a mistake in numbers the science itself is not at fault it remains true and entire the error of the poor arith metician is all the greater the less he knows of the science 21 quite right i see you are not untaught in these matters and so have quickly found a reply but suppose some one said that numbers make their impression on our minds not in their own right but rather as images of visible things springing from our contacts by bodily sense with corporeal objects what would you reply would you agree ev i could never agree 148 augustine earlier writings to that even if i did perceive numbers with the bodily senses i could not in the same way perceive their divisions and relations by referring to these mental operations i show anyone to be wrong in his counting who gives a wrong answer when he adds or subtracts moreover all that i contact with a bodily sense such as this sky and this earth and whatever i perceive to be in them i do not know how long it will last but seven and three make ten not only now but always in no circumstances have seven and three ever made anything else than ten and they never will so i maintain that the unchanging science of num bers is common to me and to every reasoning being 22 aug i do not deny that your reply is certainly most true but you will easily see that numbers are not conveyed to us by our bodily senses if you consider that the value of every number is calculated according to the number of times it contains the number one for example twice one is called two thrice one is called three ten times one is called ten and every number receives its name and its value according to the number of times it contains the number one whoever thinks with exacti tude of unity will certainly discover that it cannot be perceived by the senses whatever comes into contact with a bodily sense is proved to be not one but many for it is corporeal and there fore has innumerable parts i am not going to speak of parts so minute as to be almost unrealizable but however small the object may be it has at least a right hand part and a left hand part an upper and a lower part a further and a nearer part one part at the end and another at the middle we must admit that these parts exist in any body however small and accord ingly we must agree that no corporeal object is a true and abso lute unity and yet all these parts could not be counted unless we had some notion of unity when i am seeking unity in the corporeal realm and am at the same time certain that i have not found it nevertheless i know what i am seeking and failing to find and i know that i cannot find it or rather that it does not exist among corporeal things when i know that no body is a unity i know what unity is if i did not know what unity is i could not count the plurality of parts in a body however i have come to know unity i have not learned it from the bodily senses for by them i can know only corporeal objects and none of them as we haye proved is a true unity moreover if we do not perceive unity with any bodily sense neither do we per ceive any number of the kind at any rate which we discern with the intellect for there is none of them which is not a on free will 149 multiple of unity and unity cannot be perceived by the bodily senses the half of any body however small requires the other half to complete the whole and it itself can be halved a body can be divided into two parts but they are not simply two they may in turn be further sub divided but the number two consists of twice simple unity so that the half of two that is simple unity cannot be sub divided by two or three or any other number whatever because it is true and simple unity 23 following the order of the numbers we see that two comes next to one and is found to be the double of one the double of two does not immediately follow three comes first and then four which is the double of two throughout the numerical series this order extends by a fixed and unchangeable law after one which is the first of ail numbers two follows immedi ately which is the double of one after the second number that is two in the second place in order comes the double of two in the first place after two comes three and in the second place four the double of two after the third number three in the third place comes its double for after three four comes first five second and in the third place six which is the double of three similarly the fourth number after the fourth is its double five six seven and in the fourth place eight which is the double of four and throughout the numerical scries you will find the same rule holds good from first to last the double of any number is found to be exactly as far from that number as it is from the beginning of the series how do we find this change less firm and unbroken rule persisting throughout the numerical series no bodily sense makes contact with all numbers for they are innumerable how do vc know that this rule holds through out how can any phantasy or phantasm yield such certain truth about numbers which are innumerable we must know this by the inner light of which bodily sense knows nothing 24 by many such evidences all disputants to whom god has given ability and who are not clouded by obstinacy are driven to admit that the science of numbers does not pertain to bodily sense but stands sure and unchangeable the common posses sion of all reasoning beings many other things might occur to one that belong to thinkers as their common and as it were public property things which each beholder sees with his own mind and reason and which abide inviolate and unchangeable but i am glad that the science of numbers most readily occurred to you when you had to answer my question for it is not in vain that the holy books conjoin number and wisdom where it 150 augustine earlier writings is written turned and inclined my heart to know and con sider and seek wisdom and number eccl 7 25 ix 25 now i ask what are we to think of wisdom itself do you think that individual men have wisdoms of their own or is there one wisdom common to all so that a man is wiser the more he participates in it ev i do not yet know what you mean by wisdom i observe that men judge variously of what deeds or words are wise soldiers think they are acting wisely in following their profession those who despise military service and give all their care and labour to agriculture think them selves wise those who leave all these things aside or reject all such temporal concerns and devote all their zeal to the search for truth how they can know themselves and god judge that this is the chief task of wisdom those who are unwilling to give themselves to the life of leisure for the purpose of seeking and contemplating truth but prefer to accept laborious cares and duties in the service of their fellows and to take part in justly ruling and governing human affairs they too think themselves to be wise moreover those who do both of these things who live partly in the contemplation of truth and partly in laborious duties which they think they owe to human society those think they hold the palm of wisdom i do not mention the sects in numerable of which there is none which does not put its own members above all others and claim that they alone are wise since we are now carrying on this discussion on the under standing that we are not to state what we merely believe but what we clearly understand i can make no answer to your question unless in addition to believing i also know by con templation and reason what wisdom is 26 aug surely you do not suppose that wisdom is anything but the truth in which the chief good is beheld and possessed all those people whom you have mentioned as following diverse pursuits seek good and shun evil but they follow different pur suits because they differ as to what they think to be good whoever seeks that which ought not to be sought even though he would not seek it unless it seemed to him to be good is never theless in error there can be no error when nothing is sought or when that is sought which ought to be sought in so far as all men seek the happy life they do not err but in so far as anyone does not keep to the way that leads to the happy life even though he professes to desire only to reach happiness he is in error error arises when we follow something which does not lead to that which we wish to reach the more a man errs in on free will his way of life the less is he wise the further he is from the truth in which the chief good is beheld and possessed everyone is happy who attains the chief good which indisputably is the end which we all desire just as it is universally agreed that we wish to be happy it is similarly agreed that we wish to be wise because no one is happy without wisdom for no one is happy except by the possession of the chief good w hich is beheld and possessed in the truth which we call wisdom before we are happy the notion of happiness is stamped upon our minds that is why we know and can say confidently without any hesitation that we want to be happy likewise even before we are wise we have the notion of wisdom stamped upon our minds for that reason each of us if asked whether he wants to be wise will without any groping in the dark answer that of course he does 27 perhaps we arc now agreed as to what wisdom is you may not be able to express it in words but if you had no notion in your mind of what it is you would not know that you want to be wise and that you ought to want to be wise that i am sure you will not deny suppose then that we are agreed as to what wisdom is please tell me wdiether you think that wisdom too like the science of numbers is common to all reasoning beings or seeing that there arc as many minds as there are men and i cannot observ e anything that goes on in your mind nor you what goes on in mine do you suppose that there are as many wisdoms as there can be wise men ezk if the chief good is one for all men the truth in which it is seen and possessed that is wisdom must be one and common to all have you any doubt that the chief good whatever it may be is one for all men ev i certainly have because i see that different men rejoice in different things as if they w ere their chief good aug i wish there w ere no more doubt about the nature of the chief good than there is about the fact that without it wiiatever it may be no one can become happy but that is a big question and demands a long discourse so let us suppose that there are just as many chief goods as there are different things sought by different people under the impression that they are chief goods surely it does not follow that wisdom is not one and common to all because the good things w hich men see in it and choose are manifold and diverse if you think it does you might as w ell doubt whether the light of the sun is one light because there are many diverse things which we see by means of it of these each one chooses at will something to enjoy looking at one man likes to behold a high iiioimtain and 152 augustine earlier writings rejoices to look at it another prefers the plain another a hollow valley or green woods or the wavy expanse of the sea some one may like all these or some of them whose united beauty contributes to the pleasure of looking at them the things which men see by the light of the sun and choose for enjoyment are many and various but the light is one in which each man sees what he enjoys looking at so although there are many diverse good things from among which each may choose what he likes and seeing and possessing it and enjoying it may rightly and truly constitute it his own chief good nevertheless it may be that the light of wisdom in which these things can be seen and possessed is one light common to all wise men ev i admit it may be so and that there is nothing to prevent there being one wisdom common to all though there are many various chief goods but i should like to know whether it is so to admit that something may be is not exactly the same as to admit that it is aug meantime we have established that there is such a thing as wisdom but we have not yet determined whether it is one and common to all or whether individual wise men have their particular wisdoms just as they have their particular souls or minds ev that is so x 28 aug we hold it as settled that there is such a thing as wisdom or at least that there are wise men and also that all men want to be happy but where do we see this for i have no doubt at all that you see this and that it is true do you see this truth in such a way that i cannot know it unless you tell me what you think or could i see this truth just as you under stand it even if you did not tell me ev i do not doubt that you too could see it even if i did not want you to aug is not one truth which we both see with our different minds common to both of us ev clearly aug again i believe you do not deny that men should strive after wisdom you admit that that is true ev i have no doubt about that aug here is anotlier truth which is one and common to all who know it though each one sees it with his own mind and not with mine or yours or any other man’s can we deny that since what is seen can be seen in common by ail who see it ev we cannot deny it aug again take such propositions as these man ought to live justly the worse ought to be subjected to the better like is to be compared with like each man should be given his due don’t you admit that these statements are absolutely true and stable to be shared by you and me and all who see them ev i agree aug the same would be true of these statements the on free will 153 incorrupt is better than the corrupt the eternal than the tem poral the inviolable than the violable ei undeniably aug could anyone claim truths of that kind as his own private truths seeing they are unchangeably present for all to contem plate who have the capacity to contemplate them no one could claim any one of them as his own for not only are they true but they are equally common property to all and again who denies that the soul ought to be turned from cor ruption and converted to incorruption in other words not corruption but incorruption ought to be loved who confessing that that is true does not also understand that it is unchangeably true and can be understood in common by all minds which have the capacity to understand it ev most true aug will anyone doubt that a life which no adversity can drive from a certain and honourable opinion is better than one which is easily broken and overwhelmed by temporal disadvantages ev who can doubt it 29 aug i shall ask no more questions of that kind it is sufficient that you see as i do that these rules and guiding lights of the virtues as we may call them are true and unchangeable and singly or all together they stand open for the common con templation of those who have the capacity to behold them each with his own mind and reason this you admit is quite certain but i do ask whether you think these truths belong to wisdom for i am sure you think that he who has acquired wisdom is wise ev i most certainly do aug could the man who lives justly so live unless he saw how to apply the principles of sub ordinating the inferior to the superior joining like to like and giving to each his due ev he could not aug would you deny that he who sees this sees wisely ev i would not aug does not he who lives prudently choose incorruption and per ceive that it is preferable to corruption ev clearly aug he makes what no one doubts is the right choice as to the goal towards which he should direct his mind can it be denied that he has made a wise choice ev i could not deny it when he directs his mind to wffiat he has wisely chosen again he does it wisely ev most certainly aug and if by no terrors or penalties can he be driven from what he hm wisely chosen and towards which he has wisely directed his mind again there is no doubt that he acts wisely ev there is no doubt it is therefore abundantly evident that these rules and guiding lights of virtue as we have called thern belong to wisdom the more a man uses them in eving his life and the 154 augustine earlier writings more closely he follows them the more wisely does he live and act everything that is wisely done cannot rightly be said to be done apart from wisdom ev that is perfectly true aug just as the rules of numbers are true and unchangeable and the science of numbers is unchangeably available for all who can learn it and is common to them all so the rules of wisdom are true and unchangeable when you were asked about them one by one you replied that they were true and evident and open to the common contemplation of all who have the capacity to examine them xi 30 ev i cannot doubt it but i should very much like to know whether wisdom and numbers are contained within one class of things you mentioned that they were linked to gether in the holy scriptures or is one of them derived from the other or contained within the other for example is number derived from wisdom or is it contained in wisdom i should not dare to suggest that wisdom is derived from number or is con tained in it for i know many arithmeticians or accountants or whatever they are to be called who count perfectly and indeed marvellously but somehow very few of them have wisdom perhaps none so wisdom strikes me as being far more worthy of respect than arithmetic aug you mention a matter which has often made me wonder too when i consider in my mind the unchangeable science of numbers and the recondite sanc tuary or region or whatever other name we are to give to the realm and abode of numbers i find myself far removed from the corporeal sphere i find possibly some vague idea but no words adequate to express it and so in order to say something i return wearily to these numbers which are set before our eyes and call them by their wonted names the same thing happens when i am thinking as carefully and intently as i can about wisdom and so i greatly marvel that though wisdom and number are alike in being mysteriously and certainly true and are linked together by the testimony of scripture which i have quoted i say i marvel greatly that number is so contemptible to the majority of men while wisdom is precious to be sure it may be because they are one and the same thing on the other hand it is also written in scripture of wisdom that she reaches from one end of the world to the other with full strength and ordereth things graciously wisdom 8 1 perhaps it is called number from its potency to reach with strength from end to end and is properly called wisdom because it graciously ordereth all things for both are functions of wisdom alone on free will 55 31 wisdom has given numbers even to the smallest and most remote of things and all bodies have their own numbers but it has not given to bodies the power to be wise nor even to all souls but only to rational souls in which as it were it has taken up its abode from whence it ordereth all things even the smal lest to which it has given numbers now we have no difficulty in judging corporeal things as things which belong to a lower order and the numbers they bear stamped upon them we see are also lower than we are therefore we hold them in con tempt but when we begin to consider them from another angle we discover that they transcend our minds and abide un changeably in the truth and because few can be wise and many fools can count men admire wisdom and despise num bers but learned and studious men the further they are removed from earthly corruption behold the more clearly in the light of truth both numbers and wisdom and hold both to be precious by comparison with truth they prize neither gold nor silver nor the other things over which men strive indeed they even come to think of themselves as of little account 32 there is no need to be surprised that men think little of numbers and value wisdom highly because counting is easier than being wise you see how they set a higher value on gold than on the light of a candle compared with which gold is a ridiculous thing but a vastly inferior thing is more highly honoured because any beggar can light himself a candle and only a few possess gold far be it from me to suggest that com pared with numbers wisdom is inferior both are the same thing but wisdom requires an eye fit to see it from one fire light and heat are felt as if they were consubstantial so to speak they cannot be separated one from the other and yet the heat reaches those things which are brought near to the fire while the light is diffused far and wide so the potency of intellect which indwells wisdom causes things nearer to it to be warm such as rational souls things further away such as bodies it does not affect with the warmth of wisdom but it pours over them the light of numbers probably you will find that obscure but no similitude drawm from isible things can be completely adapted to explain an invisible thing so as to be understood by everybody only take note of this which is suffi cient for the problem we have in hand and is clear enough to humbler kinds of mind such as ours though it cannot be made crystal clear to us whether number is part of wisdom or is derived from wisdom or vice versa or whether both names can 156 augustine earlier writings be shown to designate one thing it is at least evident that both are true and unchangeably true xii 33 accordingly you will never deny that there is an unchangeable truth which contains everything that is un changeably true you will never be able to say that it belongs particularly to you or to me or to any man for it is available and offers itself to be shared by all who discern things immut ably true as if it were some strange mysterious and yet public light who would say that what is available to be shared by all reasoning and intelligent persons can be the private property of any of them you remember i dare say our recent discussion about the bodily senses those things with which we both make contact by means of our eyes or ears colours and sounds which you and i see or hear together do not belong to our actual eyes or ears but are common to both of us so that we may alike perceive them so you would never say that those things which you and i behold in common each with his own mind belong to the actual mind of either of us you would not say that what the eyes of two persons see belongs to the eyes of one or the other of them it is a third thing towards which both direct their regard ev that is most clear and true 34 aug do you then think that this truth of which we have already spoken so much and in which we behold so many things is more excellent than our minds or equal to our minds or inferior if it were inferior we should not use it as a standard of judgment but should rather pass judgment on it as we do on bodies which are inferior to our minds for of them we often say not only that it is so or is not so but that it ought to be so or not so similarly with our minds we know not only that it is thus or thus but often also that it ought to be thus or thus we judge of bodies when we say this is not so white as it ought to be or not so square and so on of minds we say this one is not so cap able as it ought to be or it is not gentle enough or eager enough according to our moral standard all these judgments we make according to those inward rules of truth which we discern in common but no man passes any judgment on these rules one may say the eternal is superior to the temporal or seven and three are ten but no one says these things ought to be so knowing simply that they are so one does not examine them with a view to their correction but rejoices to have discovered them if then truth were the equal of our minds it too would be mut able our minds sometimes see more sometimes less and so confess their mutability but truth abiding steadfast in itself on free wile 157 neither advances when we see more nor falls short when we see less abiding whole and uncorrupt it rejoices with its light those who turn to it and punishes with blindness those who turn from it we pass judgment on our minds in accordance with truth as our standard while w e cannot in any way pass judgment on truth for ave say of our mind it understands less than it ought or it understands exactly as it ought and a mind approaches the proper standard of intelligence as it is brought nearer to unchangeable truth and becomes able to cleave to it hence if truth is neither inferior to nor equal to our mind it must be superior and more excellent xiii 35 i promised if you remember to show you some thing superior to the human mind and reason there it is truth itself embrace it if you can enjoy it delight in the lord and he will grant you the petitions of your heart what do you ask for more than to be happy and what is more happy than to enjoy unshakable unchangeable truth wdiich is excellent above all things men exclaim that they are happy when they em brace the beautiful bodies deeply longed for of their wives or even of harlots and shall we doubt that we are happy in the embrace of truth men exclaim that they are happy when with throats parched with heat they find a fountain flowing with pure w atcr or being hungry find a copious meal all ready pre pared and shall we deny that w e are happy when truth is our meat and drink we are wont to hear the voices of people pro claiming that they are happy if they lie among roses or other flowers and enjoy scented ointments and shall we hesitate to call ourselves happy avhen we are inspired by truth many place happiness in music vocal and instrumental flutes and strings when they are without music they consider themselves unhappy when they have it they are transported with joy shall we when the harmonious and creative silence of truth steals so to speak noiselessly over our minds seek the happy life elsewhere and fail to enjoy that w hich is ours noiv and securely men delight in the sheen of gold and silver gems and colours they delight in the brightness and pleasantness of visible light as it appears in fire or in the sun moon and stars when no trouble or want comes to rob them of that pleasure they think themselves happy and therefore wish to live for ever shall we fear to place the happy life in the light of truth 36 nay since the chief good is recognized to be truth and is possessed when truth is possessed and truth is wisdom in wis dom let us discern the chief good and possess it and enjoy it 158 augustine earlier writings he is happy indeed who enjoys the chief good truth points out all the things that are truly good and intelligent men according to their capacity choose one or more of them in order to enjoy them people for example find pleasure in looking at some object which they are glad to behold in the light of the sun those among them who are endowed with strong healthy eyes love to look at nothing better than at the sun itself which sheds its light upon the other things which delight weaker eyes so a strong and vigorous mental vision may behold many true and changeless things with certain reason but directs its regard to the truth itself whereby all things are made clear and cleav ing to the truth and forgetting as it were all other things it enjoys them all together in the truth whatever is pleasant in other true things is pleasant also in truth itself 37 herein is our liberty when we are subject to truth and truth is our god who liberates us from death that is from the condition of sin for the truth itself speaking as man to men says to those who believe in him tf ye abide in my word ye are truly my disciples and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free john 8 31 32 no soul enjoys a thing with liberty unless it also enjoys it with security xiv but no one is secure in the possession of goods which he can lose against his will truth and wisdom no one can lose unwillingly from them there can be no spatial separation what is called separation from truth and wisdom is a perverse will which loves lower things no one wills anything involun tarily here is something which we can all enjoy equally and in common here there is no straitness no deficiency she re ceives all her lovers being grudging to none shared by all in common but chaste to each none says to another stand back that i too may approach or remove your hand that i too may touch all cleave to the same wisdom all are brought into contact with it nothing is consumed as in the case of food and you cannot drink so as to prevent me from drinking too from that common store you can convert nothing into your private possession what you take remains unharmed for me to take also i do not have to wait for you to breathe out what you have breathed in that i may then breathe it in nothing ever belongs to one man or to any group of men as a private posses sion the whole is common to all at one and the same time 38 truth therefore is less like the things we touch or taste or smell and more like the things we hear and see for every word is heard as a whole by all who hear it and by each one at the same on free will 159 time and every sight offered to the eyes is exactly the same for all who see it and is seen by all at the same time but though there is similarity there is also a great difference a whole word is not spoken all at once it is extended over a period of time one syllable being pronounced first and another after it evei'y visible sight varies with the place from which it is seen and is nowhere seen in its totality and certainly all these things can be taken from us whether we will or no and there are difficul ties in the way of our enjoying them even supposing someone could sing sweetly for ever those who were eager to hear him would come as rivals they would get packed closely together and the more there were of them they would strive for seats each one anxious to get nearer to the singer and when they heard him no one would be able to retain permanently what was heard they would hear nothing but transient fugitive sounds if i wanted to look at the sun and had the power to do so without being dazzled nevertheless it would forsake me when it set or it might be veiled in cloud and for many other causes 1 might unwillingly lose my pleasure in seeing the sun and supposing i had the power and pleasure of eternally seeing the light and hearing music what great advantage would i have seeing that even beasts could share it with me but the beauty of truth and wisdom so long as there is a persevering will to enjoy it does not exclude those who come by any packed crowd of hearers it does not pass with time or change with locality it is not interrupted by night or shut off by shadow and is not subject to the bodily senses to all who turn to it from the whole world and love it it is close at hand everlasting bound to no parti cular spot never deficient externally it suggests internally it teaches all who behold it it changes for the better and by none is it changed for the worse no one judges it and no one without it judges aright hence it is evident beyond a doubt that wisdom is better than our minds for by it alone they are made indi vidually wise and are made judges not of it but by it of ali other things whatever xv 39 you admitted for your part that if i could show you something superior to our minds you would confess that it was god provided nothing existed that was higher still i accepted your admission and said it would be sufficient if i demon strated that if tliere is anything more excellent than wisdom doubtless it rather is god but if there is nothing more excel lent then truth itself is god whether there is or is not such a higher thing you cannot deny that god exists and this vas the l60 augustine earlier writings question set for our discussion if you are influenced by what we have received in faith from the holy discipline of christ that there is the father of wisdom remember that we also received in faith that there is one equal to the eternal father namely wisdom who is begotten of him hence there should be no further question but we should accept it with unshakable faith god exists and is the truest and fullest being this i suppose we hold with undoubting faith now we attain it with a certain if tenuous form of knowledge this is sufficient for the question in hand so that we can go on to explain other pertinent questions unless you have any opposition to offer ev i accept what you have said with incredible and inexpressible joy and i declare it to be absolutely certain i declare it in my mind where i hope to be heard by the truth itself and where i hope to cleave to truth for i confess that it is not only good but the chief good and the beatific good 40 aug indeed you are right and i too am very glad but are we already wise and happy or are we still merely making for the source of wisdom and happiness ev i think we are rather making for the source aug whence then do you derive your comprehension of the certain truths which have made you shout for joy has your comprehension got some connection with wisdom or can a foolish person know wisdom ev so long as he remains foolish he cannot aug are you then wise already or do you not yet know wisdom ev indeed i am not yet wise and yet i should not say that i am foolish for i have some inkling of wisdom i cannot deny that since these things which i know are certain and they belong to wisdom aug tell me pray wouldn’t you admit tliat he who is not just is unjust and he who is not prudent is imprudent and he who is not temperate is intemperate is there any doubt about that ev i admit that when a man is not just he is unjust and i should reply similarly with regard to prudence and temperance why then shouldn’t a man be foolish when he is not wise ev i allow that too when anyone is not wise he is foolish aug now to which class do you belong ev whichever of these epithets you care to apply to me i do not venture yet to call myself wise i see that the consequence of my admissions is that i must not hesitate to call myself foolish aug then a foolish person knows wisdom for as we said no one would be certain that he wanted to be wise and that he ought to be wise unless the notion of wisdom were implanted in his mind think how you were able to reply to one question after another in on free will l6l matters which belong to wisdonij and how you rejoiced to know them ev yes that is so xvi 41 aug what do we do when we are eager to be wise don’t w’e with ali possible keenness give our wliole soul 30 to speak to what is mentally discerned and keep it stead fastly fixed on that so that it may not rejoice in any private possession of its own which will implicate it in transient things but having put off all affections for things temporal and spatial it may apprehend what remains ever one and the same for as the soul is the whole life of the body so is god the happy life of the soul while we do as i have just described so long as we continue we are in the way hz if it is given us to rejoice in these true and certain blessings as they glimmer for us even now on our still darkly shadowed way perhaps this is what scripture means when it describes how wisdom deals with the lovers who come to her for it is written tn their paths she appeareth unto them graciously and in every purpose she meeteth them wisdom 6 16 wherever you turn she speaks to you through certain traces of her operations when you are falling away to external things she recalls you to return within by the very forms of external things whatever delights you in corporeal objects and entices you by appeal to the bodily senses you may see is governed by number and when you ask how that is so you will return to y our mind within and know that you could neither approve nor disapprove things of sense unless you had within you as it were laws of beauty by which you judge all bca utiful things wliich you perceive in the world 42 behold the heaven the earth the sea all that is bright in them or above them all that creep or fly or swim all have forms because all have number take away number and tliey will be nothing from whom have they their being if not from him who has made number for they exist only in so far as they have number the artificers of all corporeal forms work by number and regulate their operations diereby in working they move their hands and tools until that which is fashioned in the outer world being referred to the inward light of number receives such perfection as is possible and being reported on by the senses pleases the internal judge who beholds the supernal ideal numbers do you ask who moves the limbs of the arti ficer it will be number for they too move by number suppose there is no actual w ork in hand and no intention to make anything but the motions of the limbs are done for pleasure that will be dancing ask what delights you in dancing i62 augustine earlier writings and number will reply lo here am l examine the beauty of bodily form and you will find that everything is in its place by number examine the beauty of bodily motion and you will find everything in its due time by number examine the art which produces all these things and you never anywhere find in it either space or time but it is alive with number it has neither place in space nor length of days and yet those who want to become artificers while they accustom themselves to learning their art move their bodies in space and time and their minds at least in time they become more skilled i mean with the passing of time but rise above even the mind of the artificer to behold the eternal realm of number then wisdom will shine upon you from its inward seat from the secret place of truth if truth repels you still because you look for it somewhat lan guidly direct your mental vision to that path in which she shows herself graciously remember that you have postponed a vision that you will seek again when you have become stronger and sounder 43 woe to those who abandon thy leading and wander among things which are but signs of thy working who love thy nod rather than thyself and are oblivious to what thou teachest thereby o wisdom sweetest light of the purified mind for thou ceasest not to suggest to us what and how great thou art thy pleasure is the whole glory of created beings an artificer somehow suggests to the spectator of his work through the very beauty of the work itself not to be wholly content with that beauty alone but to let his eye so scan the form of the material thing made that he may remember with affection him who made it those who love thy creatures in place of thee are like men who listening to an eloquent sage pay too much attention to the sweetness of his voice and the aptness of his verbal style and miss the meaning of his sentences of which the words are but the sound signals as it were woe to those who turn away from thy light and are happy enough to remain in their own obscurity it is as if they turned their backs on thee and went on with their carnal labours in their own shadows yet even so what pleases them is theirs because of thy light shining all round them but so long as the shadow is loved the mind’s eye is made languid and becomes less able to bear to behold thee so a man becomes more and more shrouded in darkness so long as he pursues willingly what he finds in his weakness is more easy to receive then he begins not to be able to see what supremely is and to consider that to be evil which deceives him because on free will 163 of his lack of foresight or tempts him because he is in need or tortures him because he is a slave all these things he deservedly suffers because he has turned away from truths and whatever is just cannot be evil 44 neither by bodily sense nor by the thinking mind can you find any mutable thing which is not contained in some numerical form take away the form and it sinks to nothing ness nevertheless do not doubt that there is an eternal and im mutable form which prevents these mutable things from being reduced to nothingness and preserves them through their appointed periods of existence in their measured motions and with their distinct varieties of form that eternal form is neither contained in nor diffused through space nor does it extend through or vary with changing times yet by it all other things can be formed and each in its own kind can occupy spaces and times in which number rules xvii 45 every mutable thing must also be capable of receiving form we call that mutable which can be changed and similarly we call that formable which is capable of re ceiving form nothing can torm itself because nothing can give itself what it does not have to be termed means pre cisely to have form hence if a thing has form it does not need to receive what it has if it has not form it cannot give itself form so as we said nothing can form itself what more shall we say about the mutability of the body and the mind we have said enough before the conclusion is that both body and mind receive form from a form that is unchangeable and eternal of this form it is written thou shalt change them and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years have no end ps 102 26 27 the prophetic word says years without end meaning eternity again of this form it is written she re maining in herself reneweth all things wisdom 7 27 hence we understand that all things are ruled by providence if all existing things would cease to be if form were taken from them the unchangeable form by which all mutable things exist and fulfil their functions in the realm of number is to them a pro vidence if it were not they would not be therefore he who journeys towards wisdom beholding and considering the whole created universe finds wisdom appearing unto him graciously on his way and meeting him in every purpose or providence and his eagerness to press along that way is ail the greater because he sees that the way is rendered beautiful by the wisdom he longs to reach 164 augustine earlier writings 46 if you can find any other kind of creature besides these three that which is but has not life that which is and lias life but not intelligence and that which is and has life and intelli gence you may then dare to say that there is some good thing which does not owe its existence to god now instead of speak ing of three kinds of things we may speak simply of two body and life for the life of beasts which live but have not intelli gence and the life of men who have intelligence too are both alike correctly called life of course we also speak of the life of the creator but that is life in a supreme sense when i speak now about body and life i am thinking only of created things well these two created things body and life being formable as we said and returning to nothingness when form is com pletely taken from them clearly show that they owe their existence to the form wdiich remains always the same there can be no good things whether great or small which do not owe their existence to god among created things what can be greater than intelligent life and what can be smaller than body however defective they may become thereby tending to nothingness still some form remains in them so that they have some kind of existence whatever of form remains in any defective thing derives from that form which cannot be defec tive and which does not allow the movement of things up or down the scale of being to transgress the laws of their being whatever therefore in nature is observed to be praiseworthy whether it is thought worthy of great or small praise should point to the exceeding and ineffable praise of the creator have you anything to say to that xviii 47 ev i confess i am entirely convinced and i see also how it can be demonstrated so far as that is possible in this life and among people like us that god exists and that all good things come from him for all things which exist whether they merely exist or have in addition life and intelligence all are from god now let us look at the third question which is this can it be shown that free will is to be numbered among the things which are good when this has been demonstrated i shall not hesitate to concede that god has given us free will and has rightly given it to us aug you do well to recall the ques tions we proposed for our discussion and you have shown your vigilance in observing that the second of them has been an swered but you ought to have seen that the third also has been solved you said you thought that we ought not to have been given free will because by it men commit sin when i urged on free will 165 against your statement that without free choice men could not act rightly and asserted instead that god gave it to that end you replied that vc should have been given free will just as we have been given justice wliich can only be used rightly your reply compelled us to travel the long circuitous route of discus sion in order to prove that all good things great and small come from god alone for that could not be clearly shown un less in the first place our poor reason such as it is should with god’s aid on our perilous journey hit upon some evident answer in so great a matter to the opinions of impious folly such as the fool shows who says in his heart there is no god these two propositions that god exists and that all good things come from liim wc already held firmly by faith but we have so thoroughly discussed them that the third proposition too that free will is to be numbered among the things which are good has been made clear 48 in our previous discussion it was made obvious and was agreed by us both that body occupies by nature a lower rank in the scale of being than docs soul and that therefore soul is a greater good than body if then wc find among the good things of the body some that a man can abuse and yet cannot on that account say that they ought not to have been given since we admit that they arc good it should not be matter for surprise if in the soul too there are some good things which may be abused but which because they arc good could only have been given by him from whom all good things come you sec of how much good a body is deprived if it has no hands and yet a man makes a bad use of his hands who uses them to do cruel or base deeds if you see a man without feet you will admit that from the point of view of the wholeness of his body a ver great good is wanting and yet ou would not deny that a man makes a bad use of his feet wlio uses them to hurt another or to dis honour himself with the eyes we see the light and distinguish the forms of bodies sight is the most splendid possession our bodies have and for that reason the eyes arc set in a place of great dignity by the use of them we look after our safety and enjoy many other advantages in life yet many people use their eyes for many base purposes compelling them to serve the interests of lust you see how much good is lost to the human face if it has no eyes now who has given us eyes if not god the bountiful giver of all good things just as you approve these good things which the body enjoys and praise him who has given them paying no attention to those who make a bad use i66 augxjstine earlier writings of them even so ought you to confess that free will without which no one can live aright is a good thing divinely bestowed and that those are to be condemned who make a bad use of it rather than to suggest that he who gave it ought not to have done so 49 ev i should like you first to prove to me that free will is a good thing then i shall agree that god gave it because i admit that all good things come from god aug have i not proved this to your satisfaction after all the labour of our pre vious discussion you admitted that every corporeal form de rives its existence from the supreme form of all that is from the truth and you agreed that every form was good truth him self in the gospel tells us that even the hairs of our heads are numbered have you forgotten what we said about the supremacy of number and its power which extends from one end to the other what perversity it is to number our hairs among the good things though they are small and utterly con temptible and to attribute their creation to god the creator of all good things because all good things the greatest and the least come from him from whom is all good and yet to hesitate to ascribe free will to him seeing that without it no one can live aright even on the testimony of those who live evil lives now tell me pray what in us seems to be superior that without which we can live aright or that without which we cannot live aright ev now please spare me i am ashamed of my blind ness who can doubt that that is far superior without which there can be no right living aug will you deny that a one eyed man can live rightly ev away with such shocking mad ness aug you agree that an eye is a good thing and yet the loss of it does not prevent right living can you imagine that free will without which no one can live aright is no good thing 50 look at justice of which no one can make a bad use it is numbered among the best good things which a man can have so are all the virtues of the soul which constitute the righteous and honourable life no one makes a bad use of prudence or fortitude or temperance in all of these as injustice which you have chosen to mention right reason prevails without which there can be no virtues and no one can make a bad use of right reason xix these are therefore great good things but you must remember that there can be no good things great or small save from him from whom all good things come that is god so we were persuaded by our previous discussion in on free will 167 the course of which you so often and so gladly expressed your assent the virtues then vv’hcreby life is rightly lived are great goods but the forms of bodies without which life can be rightly lived arc the least of good things and the powers of the soul without which there can be no righteous life are intermediate goods no one makes a bad use of the virtues but of the other goods the intermediate and the small anyone can make not only a good but also a bad use no one makes a bad use of virtue just because the function of virtue is the good use of the things of which we can also make a bad use no one makes a bad use of anything when he uses it well wherefore god in his great and lavish goodness affords us not only great goods but small ones too and some intermediate between great and small his goodness is more to be praised for the great goods than for the intermediate ones and for the intermediate ones more than for the small ones but for all his goodness is to be praised more than if he had given only the great goods and not the lesser as well 51 ev i agree but i still have this difficulty we see that free will makes use of other things either well or ill how then is it to be numbered among the things we use aug every thing we know scientifically we know by means of reason and yet reason itself is numbered among the things we know by reason have you forgotten that when we were inquiring as to the things we know by reason you admitted that reason was known by reason do not marvel therefore if we use other things by free will and can also use free will by itself will which uses other things somehow also uses itself just as reason which knows other things knows itself also memory too con tains not only all the other things which it remembers but because we do not forget that we have memoiyg somehow memory remembers itself as well as other things or rather by memory we remember other things and memory too 52 will is therefore an intermediate good when it cleaves to the unchangeable good as something that is common property and not its own private preserve of the same nature that is to say as truth of which we have spoken a great deal but nothing worthy of so great a theme when will cleaves to this good man attains the happy life and the happy life that is the disposition of soul cleaving to the unchangeable good is the proper and first good of man all the virtues are there which no one can use badly however great and important the virtues may be we know well enough that they are not common property but l68 augustine earlier writings are the property of each individual man truth and wisdom are common to all and all wise men are also happy by cleaving to truth but one man does not become happy by another's hap piness if one man seeks to attain happiness by imitating an other he seeks his happiness where he sees the other found his that is to say in unchangeable and common truth no one is made prudent by the prudence of another or courageous by his courage or temperate by his temperance or just by his justice a man is made virtuous by regulating his soul according to the rules and guiding lights of the virtues which dwell indestructibly in the truth and wisdom that are the common property of all for so the virtuous man whom he set before him for imitation has regulated his soul giving it a fixed objective 53 the will therefore which cleaves to the unchangeable good that is common to all obtains man's first and best good things though it is itself only an intermediate good but the will which turns from the unchangeable and common good and turns to its own private good or to anything exterior or inferior sins it turns to its private good when it wills to be governed by its own authority to what is exterior when it is eager to know what belongs to others and not to itself to inferior things when it loves bodily pleasure in these ways a man becomes proud inquisitive licentious and is taken captive by another kind of life which when compared with the life we have just described is really death and yet it is still governed and disposed by divine providence which appoints for all things their proper places and distributes to each man his due according to his deserts so it happens that the good things sought by sinners cannot in any way be bad nor can free will be bad for we found that it was to be numbered among the intermediate goods what is bad is its turning away from the unchangeable good and its turning to changeable goods that aversion and conversion is voluntary and is not coerced therefore it is followed by the deserved and just penalty of unhappiness xx 54 but perhaps you are going to ask what is the cause of the movement of the will when it turns from the immutable to the mutable good that movement is certainly evil although free will must be numbered among good things since without it no one can live aright we cannot doubt that that movement of the will that turning away from the lord god is sin but surely we cannot say that god is the author of sin god then will not be the cause of that movement but what will be its cause if you ask this and i answer that i do not know probably you on free will 169 will be saddened and yet that would be a true answer that wliich is nothing cannot be known only hold fast to your pious opinion that no good thing can happen to you to your senses or to your intelligence or to your thought which docs not come from god xotliing of any kind can happen which is not of god do not hesitate to attribute to god as its maker ev'cry thing which you see has measure number and order w'licn you take these things completely away nothing at all will remain wher ever measure number and order arc found there is perfect form if there is some kind of inchoate form wanting measure number and order you must remove it too for inchoate form is a kind of materia lying to the hand of the artificer to use for perfecting his work for if the perfection of form is good the beginning of form is not without some grain of good take away all good and absolutely notliing will remain ail good is from god hence there is no natural existence which is not from god now that movement of diversion whidi we admit is sin is a defective movement and ail defect comes from nothing ob serve where it belongs and you will have no doubt tiiat it docs not belong to god because that defective movement is volun taxyg it is placed within our power if you fear it all you have to do is simply not to will it if you do not will it it will not exist what can be more secure than to live a life where nothing can happen to you wiiich you do not will but since man cannot rise of his own free will as he fell by ids own will spontaneously let us hold with steadfast faith the right hand of god stretched out to us from above even our lord jesus christ let us wait for him with certain hope and long for him with burning charity if you tiiink that we must still make diligent inquiry for the origin of sin i myself tliink that there is no need at all for such inquiry but if you think so we must put it off till another discussion ev i bow to your will but only so far as to postpone to another time the question you have raised but i will not allow you to imagine tliat our inquiry lias already gone far enough book iii i x evodms lt is sufficiently evident to me that free will is to be numbered among the good things and indeed not among the least of our good things we are therefore compelled to confess that it has been given us by god and that he has rightly given it to us but now if you think a suitable time has come i want 170 augustine earlier writings to learn from you whence arises the movement by which the will itself turns from the unchangeable good which is the com mon property of all to its own interests or to the interests of others or to things beneath it and so turns to mutable goods augustine why must you know this ev because if free will is so given that it has that movement by nature it turns of necessity to mutable goods and no blame attaches where nature and necessity prevail aug do you like or dislike that movement ev i dislike it aug so you find fault with it ev i do aug then you find fault with a movement of the mind though it is faultless ev no i do not but i do not know whether there is any fault in abandoning the unchangeable good and turning towards the mutable goods aug then you are finding fault with something which you do not know ev don’t insist on a verbal point i said that i did not know whether there was any fault but i meant to be understood really as having no doubt about it certainly i said i do not know but obviously i was being ironical in suggesting that there could be any doubt about so clear a matter aug just consider what is that truth you hold to be so certain that it has caused you so soon to forget what you said a moment ago if that movement of the will exists by nature or necessity it is in no w’ay culpable and yet you are so firmly convinced that it is culpable that you think fit to wax ironical about hesitation over a matter so cer tain why did you think it right to affirm or at least to say wdth some hesitation what you yourself show to be obviously false you said tf free will has been given in such fashion that it has that movement by nature then it turns to mutable things of necessity and no fault can be found w'here nature and necessity rule but you ought to have had no doubt that it was not given in that fashion since you do not doubt that that movement is culpable ev i said that the movement is culpable and that therefore it displeases me and that i cannot doubt that it is reprehensible but i hold that a soul which is thereby drawn from the unchangeable good to mutable goods is not to be blamed if its nature is such that it is so moved by necessity 2 aug to w’hom belongs the movement which you admit is blameworthy ev i see that it is in the soul but to whom it belongs i know not aug you do not deny that the soul is moved by that motion ev no aug do you then deny that the motion by which a stone is moved is the motion of the stone i don’t mean the motion that we give to it or that is given to it by some other force when it is thrown upwards but on free will i7i that by which of its own accord it falls back to earth ev i do not deny that the motion you refer to by which it turns and fills downwards is the motion of the stone but it is its natural motion if the motion of the soul is like that it too is natural and it cannot rightly be blamed for a motion that is natural even if it moves to its o vn destruction it is compelled by the necessity of its own nature moreover because we have no doubt that the soul's motion is culpable we must absolutely deny that it is natural and therefore not like the motion of the stone which is natural motion jug did we achieve anything in our two previous discussions v i am sure we did aug no doubt you remember that in the first discussion we discovered that the mind can become the slave of lust only by its own will no superior thing and no equal thing compels it to such dishonour because that would be unjust and no inferior thing has the power it remains that that must be the mind's own motion when it turns its will away from enjoyment of the creator to enjoyment of the creature if that motion is accounted blameworthy and you thought anyone who doubted that deserved to be treated ironically it is not natural but volun tary it is like the motion of the falling stone in so far as it is a motion of the soul as the former is the motion of the stone but it is dissimilar in this that it is not in the power of a stone to arrest its downward motion while if the soul is not willing it cannot be moved to abandon what is higher and to love what is lower thus the stone’s motion is natural the soul’s voiun taryv hence anyone who says that a stone sins when it is carried downwards by its own weight is i will not say more senseless than the stone but completely mad but we charge the soul with sin when we show that it has abandoned the higher things and prefers to enjoy lower things what need is there therefore to seek the origin of the movement whereby the will turns from the unchangeable to the changeable good wc acknowledge that it is a movement of the soul that it is voluntary and there fore culpable and all useful learning in this matter has its object and value in teaching us to condemn and restrain that movement and to convert our wills from falling into temporal delights to the enjoyment of the eternal good 3 ev i see and in a sense grasp that what you say is true there is nothing that i feel more certainly and more personally than that i have a will and that it moves me to enjoy this or that i know nothing i could call my own if the will by which i will yea or nay is not my own if i use it to do evil to 1725 augustine earlier writings whom is the evil to be attributed if not to myself since a good god has made me and i can do nothing right except by willing it is clearly evident that it was to this end that the will has been given to me by god who is good moreover unless the move ment of the will towards this or that object is voluntary and within our power a man would not be praiseworthy when he turns to the higher objects nor blameworthy when lie turns to lower objects using his will like a hinge there would be no use at all in warning him to pay no attention to temporal things and to will to obtain the eternal things or to wall to live aright and to be unwilling to live an evil life but whoever thinks that man is not to be so warned ought to be cut off from membership in the human race ii 4 that being so i have a deep desire to know how it can be that god knows all things beforehand and that neverthe less we do not sin by necessity whoever says that anything can happen otherwise than as god has foreknowm it is attempting to destroy the divine foreknow’lcdge with the most insensate impiety if god foreknew that the first man wuuld sin and that anyone must concede who acknowledges with me that god has foreknowledge of all future events i do not say that god did not make him for he made him good nor that the sin of the creature whom he made good could be prejudicial to god on the contrary god showed his goodness in making man his justice in punishing his sin and his mercy in delivering him i do not say therefore that god did not make man but this i say since god foreknew that man would sin that which god foreknew must necessarily come to pass how then is the will free when there is apparently this unavoidable necessity 5 aug you have knocked vigorously may god in his mercy grant us his presence and open the door to those who knock but i verily believe that the vast majority of men are troubled by that question for no other reason than that they do not ask it in a pious fashion they are swifter to make excuses for their sins than to make confession of them some are glad to hold the opinion that there is no divine providence presiding over human afiairs they commit themselves body and soul to fortuitous circumstances and deliver themselves to be car ried about and tormented by lusts they deny that there is any divine judgment and deceive human judges when they are accused they imagine that they are driven on by the favour of fortune in sculpture or painting they are wont to represent fortune as blind either because they are better than the god on free will 173 dess by whom they think they are ruled or because they confess that in their sentiments they are afflicted with that same blind ness in the case of such people it is not absurd to admit that they do cverv thing by chance seeing that they stumble in all that they do but against this opinion so full of foolish and sense less error we iia c i think sufficiently spoken in our second disputation others do not venture to deny that the providence of god presides over human affairs but they would rather in dulge in the wicked error of believing that providence is weak or unjust or evil llian confess their sins with suppliant piety if all these would suffer thcmscl cs to be persuaded to believe that the goodness justice and power of god arc greater far and far superior to any thought they can have of goodness justice or might if they would but take thought to themselves they would know that they owe thanks to god even if he had willed them to be somewhat lower in the scale of being than they actually are and with all that is within them they would exclaim with the psalmist d have spoken lord have mercy upon me heal my soul for i have sinned against thee ps 41 5 so by stages the divine mercy would bring them to wisdom they would be neither inflated by what they discover nor rebellious when they fail to find the truth by learning they would become better prepared to see the truth and by recognizing their ignorance they would become more patient in seeking it i am quite sure that these arc your views too now first answer a few questions i am going to put to you and you will see how easily i can find a solution to your tremendous problem iii 6 your trouble is this you wonder how it can be that these two propositions are not contradictory and incompatible namely that god has foreknowledge of all future events and that we sin voluntarily and not by necessity for if you say god foreknows that a man will sin he must necessarily sin but if there is necessity there is no voluntary choice in sinning but rather fixed and unavoidable necessity you are afraid that by that reasoning the conclusion may be reached either that god’s foreknowledge of a future events must be impiously denied or if that cannot be denied that sin is committed not voluntarily but by necessity isn't that your difficulty v exactly that aug yon think therefore that ah things of winch god has foreknowledge happen by necessity and not voluntarily ezk yes absolutely aug yry an experiment and examine yourself a little and tell me what kind of will you are going to have to morrow will you want to sin or to do 174 augustine earlier writings right ev i do not know aug do you think god also does not know ev i could in no wise think that aug if god knows what you are going to will to morrow and foresees what all men are going to will in the future not only those who are at present alive but all who will ever be much more will he foresee what he is going to do with the just and the impious ev certainly if i say that god has foreknowledge of my deeds i should say with even greater confidence that he has foreknow'ledge of his own acts and foresees with complete cer tainty what he is going to do aug don’t you see that you will have to be careful lest someone say to you that if all things of which god has foreknowledge are done by necessity and not voluntarily his own future acts will be done not voluntarily but by necessity ev when i said that all future events of which god has foreknowledge happen by necessity i was hav ing regard only to things which happen within his creation and not to things which happen in god himself indeed in god nothing happens everything is eternal aug god then is not active within his creation ev he determined once for all how the order of the universe he created was to go on and he never changes his mind aug does he never make anyone happy ev indeed he does aug he does it precisely at the time when the man in question actually becomes happy ev that is so aug if then for example you yourself are happy one year from now you will be made happy at that time ev exactly aug god knows to day what he is going to do a year hence ev he eternally had that foreknowledge but i agree that he has it now if indeed it is to happen so 7 aug now tell me are you not god’s creature and will not your becoming happy take place within your experience ev certainly i am god’s creature and if i become happy it will be within my experience aug if god then makes you happy your happiness will come by necessity and not by the exercise of your w'ill ev god’s will is my necessity aug will you then be happy against your will ev if i had the power to be happy i should be so at once for i wish to be happy but am not because not i but god makes me happy aug the truth simply cries out against you you could not imagine that having in our power means anything else than being able to do what we will therefore there is nothing so much in our power as is the will itself for as soon as we will volumus im mediately will voluntas is there we can say rightly that we do not grow old voluntarily but necessarily or that we do not die on free will 2 75 voluntarily but from necessity and so with other similar things but who but a raving fool would say that it is not voluntarily that we will therefore though god knows how wx are going to will in the future it is not proved that wc do not voluntarily will anything when you said that you did not make yourself happy you said it as if i had denied it what i say is that when you become happy in the future it will take place not against your will but in accordance wuth your willing therefore though god has foreknowledge of your happiness in the future and though nothing can happen otherwise than as he has fore known it for that would mean that there is no foreknowledge wx are not thereby compelled to think that you will not be happy voluntarily that would be absurd and far from true god’s foreknowledge which is even to day quite certain that you are to be happy at a future date does not rob you of your will to happiness when you actually attain happiness similarly if ever in the future you have a culpable will it will be none the less your will because god had foreknowiedge of it 8 observe pray how blind are those wdio say that if god has foreknowledge of what i am going to will since nothing can happen otherwise than as he has foreknown it therefore i must necessarily will what he has foreknown if so it must be ad mitted that i will not voluntarily but from necessity strange folly is there then no difference between things that happen according to god’s foreknowiedge where there is no interven tion of man’s will at all and things that happen because of a will of w'hich he has foreknowiedge i omit the equally mon strous assertion of the man i mentioned a moment ago who says i must necessarily so will by assuming necessity he strives to do away with will altogether if i must necessarily will why need i speak of willing at all but if he puts it in another way and says that because he must necessarily so will his will is not in his own powxr he can be countered by the answer you gave me when i asked whether you could become happy against your will you replied that you would be happy now if the matter were in your powxr for you willed to be happy but could not achieve it and i added that the truth cries out against you for wx cannot say we do not have the powxr unless we do not have what we will if wx do not have the will we may think we will but in fact we do not if wx cannot will without willing those who will have will and all that is in our power we have by willing our will would not be will unless it were in our po'wer because it is in our power it is free we have 176 augustine earlier writings nothing that is free which is not in our power and if wc have something it cannot be nothing hence it is not necessary to deny that god has foreknowledge of all things while at the same time our wills arc our o vn god has foreknowledge of our will so that of which he has foreknowledge must come to pass in other words we shall exercise our wills in the future because he has foreknowledge that we shall do so and there can be no will or voluntary action unless it be in our po ver hence god has also foreknowledge of our power to will my power is not taken from me by god’s foreknowledge indeed 1 shall be more certainly in possession of my power because he whose foreknow ledge is never mistaken foreknow s that i shall have the po vcr ev now i no longer deny that whatever god has foreknown must necessarily come to pass nor that he has foreknowledge of our sins but in such a way that our wills remain free and within our powtt iv 9 aug what further difficulty do you have perhaps you have forgotten what we established in our first disputation and now wisli to deny that we sin voluntarily and under no compulsion from anything superior inferior or equal to us ev i do not venture to deny that at all but i must confess i do not yet see how god’s foreknowledge of our sins and our freedom of will in sinning can be other than mutually contra dictory wc must confess that god is just and knows all things beforehand but i sliould like to know with what justice he punishes sins which must necessarily be committed or how they are not necessarily committed when he knows that they will be committed or how the creator is to escape having im puted to him anything that happens necessarily in his creature 10 aug why do you think our free will is opposed to god’s foreknowledge is it because it is foreknowledge simply or be cause it is god’s foreknowledge ev in the main because it is god’s foreknowledge aug if you knew in advance that such and such a man would sin there would be no necessity for him to sin ev indeed there would for i should have no real foreknowledge unless i knew for certain what was going to happen aug so it is foreknowledge generally and not god’s foreknowledge specially that causes the events foreknown to happen by necessity there would be no such thing as fore knowledge unless there was certain foreknowledge ev i agree but why these questions aug unless i am mistaken you would not directly compel the man to sin though you knew beforehand that he was going to sin nor does your prescience on free will 177 in itself compel him to sin even though he was certainly going to sin as we must assume if you have real prescience so there is no contradiction here simply you know beforehand what another is going to do with his own will similarly god compels no man to sin though he sees beforehand those wlio arc going to sin by their own will ii why then should he not justly punish sins which though he had foreknowledge of them lie did not compel the sinner to commit just as you apply no compulsion to past events by ha ing them in your meinorsg so god by his foreknowledge does not use compulsion in the ease of future c cnts just as you remember your past actions though a that you remember were not actions of your own so god has foreknowledge of all his own actions but is not the agent of ai that he foreknows of evil actions he is not the agent but the just punisher from tins you may understand with what justice god punishes sins for he has no responsibility for the future actimis of men thoiig h lie knows them beforehand if he ought not to award pimislinicnt to sinners because he knew beforehand that they would sin he ought not to reward the righteous because he knew equally that they would be righteous let us confess that it belongs to his foreknowledge to allow no future event to escape liis know ledge and that it belongs to his justice to see that no sin goes unpunished by his judgment for sin is committed voluntarily and not by any coinpiiision from liis foreknowledge v 12 as to your tliird question how the creator is to escape having imputed to him any lhing that happens necessarily in his creature it is fitting for us to remember the rule of piety which says that we owe thanks to our creator that will provide us with the answer flis lavish goodness should be most justly praised even if he had made us with some lower rank in his creation though our soul be soiled with sins it is nevertheless loftier and better than if it were changed into visible light and yet light is an eminent part of creation as you can see by con sidering how much god is praised for it even by souls wholly given over to bodily sense wherefore though sinful souls are censured do not let that provoke you to say in your heart tliat it would have been better if they did not exist tlicy arc cen sured because they arc compared with what they might have been if they had not willed to sin god their maker is to be gloriously praised for the human faculties with wliicli he has endowed them not only because he justly subjects them to his order when they sin but also because he made them such that a.e.w 12 iy 8 augustine earlier writings even when soiled with sin they are not surpassed in dignity by corporeal light for which also god is rightly praised 13 possibly you would not go so far as to say that it would have been better if sinful souls did not exist but take care also not to say that they should have been other than they are whatever better argument true reason may suggest to you know at least that god made them and that he is author of all good things for it is not true reason but envious weakness that bids you think that anything ought to have been made better than it is and that nothing inferior should have been made at all that is as if you looked at the heavens and concluded that the earth ought not to have been made that is all wrong you would be quite right to find fault if you saw that the earth had been made and no heavens for then you might say the earth ought to have been made according to your ideal conception of the heavens but now you see that your ideal earth has been made only it is called not earth but heaven i believe that since you have not been defrauded of the better creation you ought not to grudge that there is an inferior creation which we call the earth in the earth again there is such a variety among its parts that you can think of nothing of an earthly nature which god has not made somewhere in the totality of his work for the earth contains land of all kinds passing by gradual stages from the most fruitful and pleasant to the most deceitful and infertile tracts so that you can only find fault with one kind of land by comparing it with a better kind so you ascend through all the grades of land with their varying praiseworthy qualities and when you find the very best land you are glad that there are the other kinds as well and yet what a difference there is between earth in all its variety and heaven water and air are interposed of these four elements various other forms and species of things are made innumerable to us but all numbered by god there may be things in the natural realm which you would never have thought of yourself but the w holly and purely rational cannot but be you can think of nothing better in the creation which the creator did not think of when the human soul says this is better than that and if it says so truly it will say so because of its relation to the divine reasons on which it depends if it understands what it says it does so likewise because of its relation to these reasons let it therefore believe that god has made what true reason knows he must have made even if it is not evident in created things if the heavens were invisible but true reason led to the conclusion on free will 79 that such a thing must have been created we ought to believe that it has been created though it do not appear to the eye for thought would have no idea that it ought to have been created if it did not have some relation to the reasons through which all things were created what does not exist can no more be thought than have true existence 14 many err because beholding the better things with their minds they look for them also with their eyes in the wrong places that would be as if someone who by rea son understood perfect rotundity should be annoyed that he did not obseiwe it in a nut assuming that he never saw any other round object besides that fruit so when some people see with true reason that there are better creatures who though they have free will have ever adhered to god and liave never sinned th.cy look at the sins of men and lament not that they may cease from sin but simply that men have been created at all they say tie did not create us such that we sliould will ever to enjoy his unchangeable truth and never to sin do not let them cry out or be anno td he did not compel them to sin by the mere fact tliat he created them and gave them power to choose good or c il as they would he made them so far like those angels who never sinned and never will sin if you delight in a creature which by volun tary perseverance never sins there is no doubt you rightly prefer it to a sinful creature just as you give it the preference in your thought so god gives it the preference in his universal order you may believe that there are such creatures in the loftier regions of the heavens for if god showed his goodness in creating creatures whom he knew beforehand would sin he would show his goodness no less in creating creatures whom he knew beforehand w’ould never sin 15 those sublime creatures have their happiness perpetually in the eternal enjoyment of their creator and their liappiness they merit by their perpetual will to hold fast to righteousness below them sinful creatures have their proper order by tlieir sins they have lost happiness but they have not lost the capacity to recover it ficrein they are superior to those creatures whose will is to remain perpetually in sin between these two extremes those who continue in the will to righteousness and those who continue in the will to sin there is this middle class who by the humility of repentance recover their exalted rank but god did not withhold the lavishness of his bounty even from his creatures who he knew beforehand would not only sin but would con tinue in the will to sin for he showed it in creating them an x80 augustine earlier writings errant horse is better than a stone that cannot err because it has neither motion nor feeling of its own so a creature which sins by its own free will is more excellent than one which cannot sin because it has no free will i would praise wine that was good of its kind and would censure the man who drank it to excess and yet i wuuld hold the man whom i had censured even while he was drunk to be superior to the wine which made him drunk even though i had praised it so the corporeal creature is rightly to be praised in its owm order though those are to be censured who use it to excess and are thereby turned away from perception of the truth and those perverse people drunkards or the like are to be preferred to the thing laudible in its own order greediness for which made them vain not indeed because of their vices but because of the dignity of their nature which still remains 1 6 soul is universally superior to body no soul can fall so far in sinfulness as to be changed into body its quality as soul cannot be taken from it and it cannot in any way lose that which makes it superior to body now among corporeal objects light holds the first place consequently the worst soul is superior to the first of corporeal things it is of course possible that some body may be preferable to the body in which a soul resides but it cannot be preferred to the soul itself why then should not god be praised with all possible praise who made souls that were to abide in the laws of righteousness even if he also made other souls which he knew beforehand would sin or even persevere in sin for even these are better than things that cannot sin because they have not reason or free choice of will they are even better than the most splendid brilliance of bodies of any kind though some people the manichees greatly err ing venerate light as if it were the substance of god most high in the order of corporeal creatures from the sidereal choir down to the number of our hairs the beauty of good things is so perfectly graded that it is a sign of lack of understanding to ask avhat is this or to what purpose is that all things are created each in its own order how much more does it show lack of understanding to ask such questions about any soul whatever no matter how great a diminution of its glory it may suffer or what defects it may exhibit nevertheless it will always and without any doubt surpass in dignity every kind of body 17 reason has a different standard of judgment from that of utility reason judges by the light of truth and correctly sub ordinates lesser things to those that arc greater utility guided on free will l8l by experience of convenience often attributes a liiglier value to things which reason convinces us are of lesser rank reason sets a vast difference in value between celestial and terrestrial bodies but what carnal man would not prefer that several stars should be wanting in the heavens than that one shrub should be lacking in his field or one cow from his herd older men pay no attention to or at least are prepared patiently to correct the judgments of children who prefer the death of a man except one of those bound to them by the tics of happy aftcctioii to the death of a favourite sparrow especially if ilie man was an object of terror to them and the sparrow tvas tuneful and beautiful so if there are people unskilled in judging the values of things who praise god for his lesser creatures finding them more easily appreciated by their carnal senses a.nd do not praise him for his better and superior creatures or praise him less than they ought or try to find mult with his creatures and to point out how they might have been better or even do not believe that he created them those who liavc advanced some way tow ards wisdom either entirely scorn such judgments or hear them with good natured patience if they cannot correct them or until they arc corrected vi 1 8 such being the case it is far from the truth that the sins of the creature must be attributed to the creator even though those things must necessarily happen which he has fore known so much so that when you say you can find no reason why whatever necessarily happens in the creature should not be attributed to him i on the contrary find no way and i assert that none exists or can be found of attributing to him what is done necessarily no doubt but also by the will of the sinner if anyone says i should prefer not to exist than to exist in un happiness i shall reply that is a lie for you are miserable now and yet you do not wish to die simply because you wish to exist you donh want to be miserable but you want to continue in life all the same give thanks therefore because you exist as you wish to do so that the misery you do not wish may be taken from you you exist as you wish to do but you arc un happy against your will if you are ungrateful for your existence you are rightly coinpclied to be unhappy which you do not wish i praise the goodness of the creator because even when you are ungrateful you have wiiat you wish and i praise the justice of the orderer of things because for your ingratitude you suffer w hat oii do not wish 19 if he says i don’t want to die not because i prefer to live i82 augustine earlier writings in misery rather than not to live at all but lest i should be still more miserable after death my reply will be you will not be miserable if that would be unjust but if it would be just let us praise him by whose laws you are dealt with justly if he says how shall i know that i shall not be miserable unless misery be my just reward i shall reply if you are in your own power either you will not be miserable or you will be justly miserable because you rule yourself unjustly if you wish to rule yourself lustly and cannot you will not be in your own power you will then be in the power of no one or in the power of another if you are in no one’s power you will act willingly or unwillingly it cannot be unwillingly unless some superior force overpowers you but he who is in the power of no one cannot be overpowered by any force if willingly you are in no one’s power and you must be in your own power and either you will be miserable by ruling yourself unjustly or seeing you can be what you wish you have cause to give thanks for the goodness of your creator if you are not in your own power then someone must have you in his power who is either more powerful or less powerful than your self if he is less powerful the fault is your own and the misery just but if someone more powerful than you are hold you in his power you will not rightly think so rightful an order to be unjust it is true therefore that you will not be miserable if it is unjust and if it is just let us praise him whose laws bring it to pass vii 20 if my opponent says i prefer to be miserable rather than not to be at all because i already exist if i could have been consulted before i began to be i should have chosen not to be rather than to be miserable the fact that being miserable i fear to become non existent is part of my misery i ought to wish not to be rather than to be miserable but i do not i con fess that i do now actually prefer to be miserable than not to be but the folly of this preference is in proportion to my misery the more clearly i see how true it is that i should not have this preference the greater is my misery my reply will be this take all the greater care not to err when you think you see the truth if you were happy you would prefer to be rather than not to be now when you are miserable you nevertheless prefer a miser able existence to non existence though you do not wish to be miserable consider then how great a boon existence is seeing that both the happy and the miserable desire it if you con sider this carefully you will see that your misery is in proportion tr tlsit wviirb siinrp.mftlv exists you on free will 183 will see that the opinion that non existence is better than miser able existence depends on the extent to which you ignore what supremely exists and that you wish to be because you derive your origin from him who supremely is 21 if therefore you wish to escape misery love the very desire you have to exist for if you wish more and more to exist you will draw near to him who exists supremely and give thanks now that you exist you may be inferior to the blessed but you are superior to things which have not even the will to beatitude though many of these things are praised by miser able men all things are to be praised for the reason that they exist for what exists is for that reason alone good the more fully you love to have being the more fully will you desire eternal life and choose to be formed so that your affections will not be set on temporal things emotions kindled by love for temporal things are unjust and uncontrolled and temporal things before they come to be are not while they are in exist ence they are fleeting and when gone will not be when they come into being in the future they are not yet when they are past they already are not how can things be possessed abidingly if the beginning of their existence is a step towards their end he who loves existence approves them so far as they have existence but loves what has eternal existence if loving temporal things he was weak and variable loving eternal things he will be made strong if he was distracted by love of transient things by love of that which abides he will be made stable he will remain and possess being which he wished inasmuch as he feared non existence he could not stand fast when he was snared by love of fleeting things do not therefore let it displease you rather let it give you the greatest pleasure that you prefer even miserable existence to non existence even if thereby you hope to escape misery if you begin by wishing to exist and add a desire for fuller and fuller existence you rise in the scale and are furnished for life that supremely is so also you will keep yourself from every fall whereby lowest existence passes into non existence and undermines the strength of him who loves it hence he who prefers non existence to miserable existence cannot attain non existence and therefore must remain miserable he who loves existence more than he hates misery can by seeking an ever fuller existence exclude the misery he hates when he has attained perfect existence after liis kind he will not be miserable viii 22 see how absurd and stupid it is to say i should 184 augustine earlier writings prefer non existence to miserable existence he who says i prefer this to that chooses something non cxistence is not something it is nothing there can be no real choice when what you choose is nothing you say you want to be though you are miserable but ought not to do so what ought you to want not to be you say if you ought so to want not being must be better than being but not being cannot be better than being therefore you ought not to wish it the common sense which keeps you from really wishing non existence is more truthful than the opinion that bids you affirm that you ought to wish it every man should seek the right object of choice for when he obtains it he must necessarily become better but he cannot become better if he ceases to exist no one therefore can rightly choose non existence we ought not to be influenced by the views of those who have committed suicide because misery pressed sore upon them either they fled for refuge to a place which they thought would be better for them in which case there is nothing contrary to our argument whether they were right or wtong in their thinking or they believed that they would not exist at all in this case the false choice of those who choose nothing will affect us much less how shall i follow one who when asked what his choice is answers nothing who ever chooses non existence is immediately convicted of choosing nothing whether he is willing to admit it or not 23 i shall tell you my opinion if i can about this whole matter it seems to me that no one when he commits suicide or attempts somehow to put himself to death really feels that he will not exist after he is dead though he may have some kind of opinion to that effect opinion has to do with truth or error in the mind of the thinker or believer but feeling draws its force from custom or nature that we can hold an opinion and yet feel quite differently about a matter is easily known from the fact that often we believe that something should be done but find pleasure in doing something else sometimes feeling is more truthful than opinion if the latter is in error and the former is dictated by nature for example when a sick man finds both pleasure and advantage in drinking cold water though he wrongly believes that it will hurt him if he drink it sometimes opinion is more truthful than feeling as when a man believes his physician’s word that cold water will harm him assuming it will be hurtful and nevertheless finds pleasure in drinking it sometimes boa are equally truthful as when that which is ahwantacrfioiis is not onlv bcfievcd to bc so but is also felt to be on free will 185 pleasurable sometimes both are wrong as when that which is hurtful is believed to be advantageous and also gives pleasure right opinion is wont to correct wrong custom and wrong opinion to pervert nature even when it is right such is the power of reason when it leads and rules when a man who be lieves that he will not exist after death is driven by intolerable evils to desire death with all his heart and snatches at death his opinion that he will be rid of all being is false but so far as feeling is concerned he has merely a natural desire for rest but what is at rest is not nothing indeed it has fuller being than what is restless restlessness sets the emotions one against the other so that they destroy one another but rest has a certain constancy highly suggestive of what we mean when we say of a thing simply that it exists the whole object of wanting to die is not non cxistence but rest so while such a man erroneously believes that he will no longer exist his nature longs to be at rest that is to have fuller being so just as no one can find pleasure in non existence no one ought to be ungrateful to the goodness of his creator for the fact that he has existence ix 24 if it is said it would not have been difficult or labori ous for almighty god to have seen to it that all his creatures should have observed their proper order so that none of them should have come to misery if he is omnipotent that would not have been beyond his power and if he is good he would not have grudged it this is my answer the order of creatures pro ceeds from top to bottom by just grades so that it is the remark of envy to say that creatures should not exist and equally so to say that one should be different it is wrong to wish that anything should be like another thing higher in the scale for it has its being perfect in its degree and nothing ought to be added to it he who says that a thing ought to be different from what it is either wants to add something to a higher creature already perfect in which case he lacks moderation and justice or he wants to destroy the lower creature and is thereby wicked and grudging whoever says that any creature ought not to be is no less wicked and grudging for he wants an inferior creature not to exist which he really ought to praise for example the moon is certainly far inferior to the sun in the brightness of its light but in its own way it is beautiful adorns earthly darkness and is suited to nocturnal uses for all these things he should admit that it is worthy of all praise in its own order if he denies that he is foolish and contentious anyone who said that there should be no light would feel that he deserved to be laughed at augustine earlier writings l86 how then will he dare to say there should not be a moon if instead of saying that the moon should not exist he said that the moon ought to be like the sun what he is really saying without knowing it is not that there should be no moon but that there should be two suns in this there is a double error he wants to add something to the perfection of the universe seeing he desires another sun but he also wants to take something from that perfection seeing he wants to do away with the moon 25 perhaps he will reply that he is not complaining about the moon because though its light is less it is not unhappy his trouble does not concern the lack of lustre in souls but their misery let him carefully consider that so far as concerns the brightness of the moon and the sun there is no question of hap piness or unhappiness though these are celestial bodies they are none the less bodies so far as their light is concerned for it is perceived by the corporeal eyes corporeal things in themselves as such cannot be happy or unhappy although they can be the bodies of happy or unhappy creatures but the analogy sug gested from the celestial luminaries teaches us this lesson when you contemplate the differences between bodies and observe that some are brighter than others it is wrong to ask that the dimmer ones should be done away or made equal to the brighter ones all must be contemplated in the light of the per fection of the universe and you will see that all differences in brightness contribute to the perfection of the whole you will not be able to imagine a perfect universe unless it contains some greater things and some smaller in perfect relation one to the other similarly you must consider the differences between souls in them also you will discover that the misery you lament has this advantage the fact that there are souls which ought to be miserable because they willed to be sinful contributes to the perfection of the universe so far is it from being the case that god ought not to have made such souls that he ought to be praised for having made other creatures far inferior to miserable souls 26 but one who does not quite understand what has been said may have this to urge against our argument if our being miserable completes the perfection of the universe it will lose something of its perfection if we should become eternally happy if the soul does not come to misery save by sinning our sins also are necessary to the perfection of the universe which god has made how then does he justly punish sins without which on free will 187 is neither the sins nor the misery are necessary to the perfection of the universe but souls as such are necessary which have power to sin if they so will and become miserable if they sin if misery persisted after their sins had been abolished or if there were misery before there were sins then it might be right to say that the order and government of the universe were at fault again if there were sins and no consequent misery that order is equally dishonoured by lack of equity but since there is happiness for those who do not sin the universe is perfect and it is no less perfect because there is misery for sinners because there are souls whose sins are followed by misery and whose righteous conduct is followed by happiness because it contains all kinds of natures the universe is always complete and per fect sin and its punishment are not natural objects but states of natural objects the one voluntary the other penal the voluntary state of being sinful is dishonourable hence the penal state is imposed to bring it into order and is therefore in itself not dishonourable indeed it compels the dishonourable state to become harmonized with the honour of the universe so that the penalty of sin corrects the dishonour of sin 27 hence it comes that the sinful creature though superior is punished through the instrumentality of inferior creatures these latter are inferior but in such a way that they can be honoured by dishonourable souls and so be brought into har mony with the honour of the universe there is nothing greater in a house than a man and nothing lower and less honourable than a drain yet a slave who is found so sinful as to be held worthy of cleaning out a drain nevertheless dishonourable though he may be does honour to the drain the slave’s dis honour and the cleansed drain together form one whole both together are adapted to the proper management of the house and both contribute honourably and in perfect order to the good of the whole house if the slave had not sinned by his own will the household management would have provided some other way to accomplish the necessary work of cleansing what holds a lower place in the scale of being than the earthly body but even a sinful soul can adorn corruptible flesh so as to provide it with a comely appearance and vital motion such a soul because of its sin does not harmonize with a celestial habitation but it harmonizes with a terrestrial habitation because of its punishment so whatever a soul may choose ever beautiful and well ordered in all its parts is the universe whose maker and governor is god good souls which inhabit earthly bodies adorn 188 augustine earlier writings them by making a good use of them and not by being asso ciated with them through any misery of their own for they have none but if sinful souls were allowed to inhabit celestial regions it would be wrong for they are not suited to things of which they cannot make a good use and on which they can confer no honour 28 although this earthly globe must be accounted among corruptible things yet it preserves so far as it can the image of higher things and ceases not to show us examples and traces of higher things if we see some good and great man burned by fire so far as his body is concerned in obedience to the com mand of duty we do not call that the penalty of sin but the evidence of courage and endurance though the basest corrup tion consumes his bodily members we love him more for it than we should if he suffered nothing of that kind we marvel that his mind did not share the mutability of his body if we see the members of a cruel brigand consumed by a like punish ment we approve the legal order both throw a certain glory upon their torments but the one by the merit of his virtue the other by the demerit of his sin but suppose after or even before the burning we saw the good man changed in a manner agree able to the celestial habitation and carried up to the stars we should be glad but who would not be offended if we saw the criminal brigand either before or after his punishment but continuing to serve the cause of willing crime carried to the eternal seat of glory in heaven so both of them can adorn inferior creatures but only one of them can adorn superior creatures so are we bidden to take note that the first man adorned the mortality of our flesh inasmuch as his punishment befitted his sin and that our lord jesus did so likewise inasmuch as his mercy set us free from sin the just man abiding in justice could have a mortal body but the wicked man while he continues in iniquity cannot in the same way reach the immortality of the saints that is sublime and angelic immortality i do not mean the immortality of those angels of whom the apostle wrote know ye not that we shall judge angels i cor 6 3 but of those of whom the lord spoke they shall be equal to the angels of god luke 20 36 those who desire equality with angels for their own vain glory do not really want to be themselves equal with the angels but to have the angels equal with them if they persist in so willing they will be made equal in punishment with the apostate angels xafhn iawh tlipir nwn newer rather than the dower of almisfhtv ok free will 189 god to sucli placed upon his left hand because they did not seek god by way of the door of humility which the lord jesus christ showed us in his own person and because they lived proudly and without mercy he will say depart into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels matt 25 41 x 29 there are two sources of sin a man’s own spontaneous thought and the persuasion of a neighbour that is what the prophet meant when he said cleanse me from my secret sins o lord andkeep thy servant from the sins of others ps 19 12 13 both however are voluntary the man who sins by his own thought does not sin unwillingly and if he consents to one who persuades him to evil he does not consent without his own will it is more serious to sin by one’s own will with none persuading and in addition by envy and guile to persuade another to sin than to be brought to sin by the persuasion of another but in both kinds of sin the justice of the lord in punishing is preserved in weighing the case equitably it was found just not to keep man from falling into the power even of the devil who by evil persuasion had subjected man to himself it would have been inequitable that he should not have had dominion over his captive but it cannot be that the justice of god most high and most true which extends evcr where should take no part in preserving order even after the downfall of sinners because man had sinned less than the devil he was aided in the re covery of salvation by the very fact that he had been given over until death to the prince of this world that is the lowest and mortal part of the universe to the prince of all sin and the lord of death timid as a result of his consciousness of his mortality fearing sufferings and death from the vilest most abject even the most minute of beasts and uncertain of the future man accustomed himself to restrain unlawful pleasures and espe cially to curb pride which had persuaded him to his fall a vice which alone refuses the medicine of mercy who needs mercy more than the miserable man and who is less worthy of it than he who is at once both proud and miserable 30 hence it happened that the word of god by whorn all things were made and whom all the happy angels enjoy stretched forth his clemency to our misery the word became flesh and dwelt among us so man could eat the bread of angels but man was not yet made equal to the angels even if the bread of angels did think fit to make himself the equal of men but by coming down to us he did not abandon the angels remaining at the same time one with them and one with us he nourishes igo augustine earlier writings them inwardly by his divinity and outwardly by his humanity he admonishes us and fits us by faith to be nourished sacra mentally like the angels the rational creature feeds upon the word as its own best food but the human soul is rational it was held in penalty for its sin in mortal bonds and was so brought low that by surmising from visible things it might strive to understand invisible things the food of the rational creature became visible not by changing his own nature but by adapting it to ours in order that he might recall those who follow visible things to embrace him who is invisible so the soul which in its inward pride had forsaken him finds him again in humble guise in the outward world by imitating his visible humility it will return to its invisible position of superiority 31 the word of god god’s only son assuming human nature brought the devil whom he has always had and will have under his own laws under subjection to man he extorted nothing from him by violence but overcame him by the law of justice for the devil having deceived the woman and by her having caused her husband to fall claimed the entire offspring of the first man as subject to the law of death inasmuch as it was sinful this he did with a malicious desire to do harm but at the same time with absolute right so long as his power pre vailed that is until he slew the just man in whom he could point out nothing worthy of death not only was he slain with out fault but he was also born without lust and to lust the devil had subjugated his captives so that he might keep posses sion of all born of them as fruits of his own tree through a wicked desire to hold them but also by a just right of possession most justly therefore is the devil compelled to give up those who believe in him whom he unjustly slew in that they suffer temporal death they pay what they owe in that they live eternally they live in him who paid on their behalf what he did not owe but those whom the devil has persuaded to persist in unbelief he is justly allowed to keep as his companions in eternal damnation so man was not snatched from the devil by force seeing that the devil had taken him captive not by force but by persuasion and man who was justly brought low so as to serve him to whose evil persuasion he had consented was justly set free by him to whose good persuasion he had con sented all this is in accordance with justice because man sinned less in consenting than the devil sinned by persuading him to sin 00 nil natures not onlv thosc on free will igi which were to abide in virtue and justice but also those that were to sin he did not make them in order that they might sin but that whether they willed to sin or not to sin they might be ornaments of his universe if there were no souls occupying the highest rank in the universe such as would have power to shake and weaken the universe if they should choose to fall into sin that would be a great defect in creation that would be lacking which secures the stability and unity of the universe such are the good and holy and sublime souls of the powers celestial and super celestial over whom god alone rules and to whom the whole world is subject without their just and perfect offices there can be no universe again if there were no souls who whether by sinning or not sinning make no difference to the order of the universe again there would be a grave defect these are rational souls like in nature to those that are better but unlike in office besides these there are many inferior but praiseworthy degrees of creatures all made by god most high 33 this is the nature of those who hold the highest rank the order of the universe would suffer loss if they did not exist and also if they sinned in the case of those who hold a lower rank the loss would be caused by their non existence not by their sinning to the former is given the potency to keep all things in their proper order and without that the order of things cannot continue but they do not continue in the good will because they received that office rather they received the office because he who gave it foresaw that they would so continue nor do they keep all things in the proper order by their own majesty but because they cleave to the majesty and devotedly obey the commands of him by whom through whom and in whom all things are made to the latter also if they do not sin is given the potent office of keeping things in order but it is not given to them as their own they must fulfil it in alliance with the higher beings because god knows beforehand that they will sin spiritual natures can be joined together without being in creased in mass and separated without being decreased the higher beings do not have their action made any easier by the assistance of the lower beings nor does their action become more difficult if the lower beings desert their duty by sinning for they are not joined together by space or bodily mass but by similarity of affection and spiritual creatures can be separated by lack of likeness one to another though each possesses its own body 34 when sin has been committed the soul which has its 192 augustine earlier writings abode by god’s order in an inferior and a mortal body rules its own body not according to its own whim but as the laws of the universe allow but such a soul is not inferior to a celestial body though earthly bodies are inferior to celestial bodies the ragged garment of a condemned slave is much inferior to the garment of a slave who has deserved well and is held in high honour by his master but the slave is better than any garment however precious because he is a man the soul of higher nature inhabiting a celestial body and enjoying angelic power adheres to god and adorns and rules even ari earthly body according to the commands of him whose nod it ineffably ob serves but the soul that is burdened with mortal members has difficulty in ruling the body that oppresses it and yet it adorns it as far as it is awe other things by which it is surrounded it can affect as it has the power but its power is vastly weaker xii 35 the conclusion is that even the lowest corporeal creature would not have lacked a fitting ornament even if no soul had willed to sin that which can rule the whole also rules the part but that which has less power certainly cannot exer cise more abundant power the perfect physician can efficaci ously cure the scab but one who can give useful advice in a case of the scab cannot forthwith heal every disease of mankind if there is any certain reason why there ought to have been creatures which have never sinned nor ever will it will also make clear that they refrained from sin by their own free will they were not compelled not to sin they remained sinless by choice but even if they had sinned but that was impossible because god knew beforehand that they would not even if they had sinned god’s ineffable power would have been sufficient to rule the universe to render to all what was right and fitting and to permit nothing base or dishonourable throughout his whole dominion even if all the powers he created to help him failed him even if angelic nature had sinned and rebelled against his commandments he would still by his own majesty rule all things honourably and perfectly he would not grudge existence to spiritual creatures who has made cor poreal creatures though they are far inferior even to sinful spiritual creatures so great is his goodness that no one can reasonably view the heaven and the earth and all visible natures in their kinds measured formed ordered and believe that there is any other creator of all these things but god or refuse to confess that he is to be ineffably praised there is no than that angelic nature on free will 93 should have pre eminence by reason of the excellence of its nature and the goodness of its will but even if all the angels had sinned the creator of angels would not have lacked resources for the government of his dominion no weariness would have pre vented his goodness and no difficulty his omnipotence from creating others to set in the places of those who by sinning abandoned them and no multitude of spiritual creatures con demned for their demerits could throw into confusion an order which has a proper and suitable place for as many as are damned in whatever direction we turn our attention we find that god is to be ineffably praised who is the best creator of all natures and their most just ruler xiii 36 in conclusion let us leave the contemplation of the beauty of things to those who have the divine gift of seeing it do not let us try with words to induce those who have not the power to behold ineffable things and yet because there are loquacious weak or guileful men let us briefly summarize our answer to this great problem any nature that can become less good must be good a nature becomes less good when it is cor rupted either corruption does it no hurt and it is not corrupted or if it is corrupted corruption hurts it if it hurts it it takes away some of its good and makes it less good if it entirely de prives it of good what remains will not be able to be corrupted for there will be no good left which corruption can take aw ay so as to do hurt nothing is corrupted if corruption can do it no hurt a nature which is not corrupted is incorruptible so there will be a nature which by corruption is rendered incorruptible which is utterly absurd therefore it is true to say that any nature so far as it is such is good if it is incorruptible it is better than what is corruptible but if it is corruptible it is doubtless good since it becomes less good as the process of cor ruption goes on eveiy nature is corruptible or incorruptible therefore every nature is good and by a nature i mean w hat is also usually called a substance every substance is either god or comes from god because every good thing is either god or from god 37 these principles being established at the beginning of our discourse listen to what i am going to say every rational nature endowed with free will is indubitably to be praised if it abide in the enjoyment of the chief and changeless good every one that seeks so to abide is also to be praised but every one that does not abide in the chief good and does not will so to act that it may abide in it is so far and on that account to be a.e.w 13 194 augustine earlier writings blamed if a created rational nature is to be praised no one can doubt that its creator is also to be praised if it is to be blamed no doubt even by blaming it its creator is praised if we blame it because it will not enjoy the highest and unchanging good that is its creator clearly we are praising him how great is that chief good and how ineffably by every tongue and every thought is god the creator of all things to be honoured and praised for we can be neither praised nor blamed without praise being given to him the only reason for blaming us for not abiding in him is that to abide in him is our first and greatest and highest good how so if it be not that he is in effably good and how can he be blamed for our sins seeing there can be no blame for our sins which does not imply his praise 38 in things which are blamed nothing is blamed but their fault and nothing has a fault to be blamed if it has not a nature to be praised either what you blame is natural and not a fault and you are to be taught to correct your fault finding or if it is really a fault and rightly to be blamed it must be contrary to nature every fault by the very fact that it is a fault is contrary to nature it is no fault if it does no damage to nature if it does damage it is for that reason alone a fault and therefore it is a fault because it is contrary to nature if a nature is corrupted by another’s fault and not by its own it is unjust to blame it and we must inquire whether the other nature is not corrupted by its own fault whereby it has the power to corrupt another nature what is it to be vitiated if not to be corrupted by vice or fault a nature which is not vitiated has no fault but it has a fault if another nature can be vitiated by it hence anything that has the power to corrupt another thing with its own fault is itself vitiated to begin with and corrupts with its own fault hence we conclude that all fault or vice is contrary to nature contrary also to the nature of the thing to which the fault originally belongs nothing is blamed in anything except vice or fault and vice is vice precisely because it is contrary to the nature of the thing in which it is found therefore a fault is not rightly blamed without at the same time praising the nature in which the fault is found you have no right to be displeased with a fault except in so far as it vitiates a nature that pleases you xiv 39 now we must see whether a nature can be truly said to be corrupted by another’s vice without any vice of its own if one thing approaches another in order to corrupt it with its own vice it cannot do so unless it finds something there on pree will 95 which is capable of being corrupted if it finds that it can then bring about the corruption by means of its own vice the stronger cannot be corrupted by the weaker unless it is willing to be corrupted if it is willing the corruption starts with its own vice and not with the vice of the other similarly an equal cannot be corrupted by its equal unless it is willing a vitiated nature attacking one that is free from vice is not its equal but is weaker by reason of its own vice if the stronger corrupts the weaker then either it is by the vice of both of them there being base desire in both or it is by the vice of the stronger if its nature is so outstanding that even when vitiated it excels that of the weaker which it corrupts how could one rightly blame the fruits of the earth because men do not make a good use of them but being themselves corrupt by their own fault corrupt these fruits by abusing them in the interests of luxury for it would be madness to doubt that man’s nature even when vitiated is more powerful and more excellent than that of any of the fruits of the earth even if they are without fault 40 it may happen that a more powerful nature corrupts a less powerful one with no fault on either side if by fault we mean that which is worthy of blame who would venture to blame a frugal man who sought from the fruits of the earth no more than his natural nourishment or who would blame these fruits for being corrupted through use as food correct usage does not speak of that as corruption for the accepted meaning of corruption generally speaking makes it a synonym for vice it is easy to find examples of a stronger nature corrupting a weaker one even without using it to supply its own needs in the order of justice for example guilt is punished this is the rule to which the apostle refers when he says tf anyone corrupts the temple of god him will god corrupt i cor 3 17 or again in the order of mutable things one thing gives place to another according to the most fitting laws imposed upon the universe regulating the strength of every part if the brightness of the sun destroys anyone’s eyes because they are too weak to endure the light the sun cannot be thought to do so in order to supply any need of its own nor does it do so through any fault of its own nor are the eyes to be blamed for they obeyed their possessor when they were opened in face of the light or they were destroyed through being too weak to bear the light of all kinds of corruption that only is rightly to be blamed which is vicious other kinds are not even to be called by that name or at any rate cannot be progqri blamed igs augustine earlier writings since they are not vicious blame is applicable that is right and fitting in the case of vice alone hence it is supposed to derive its name vituperatio from vitium 41 now as i said vice is evil for no other reason than that it is hostile to the nature of the thing in which it exists as a fault hence clearly the thing itself is by nature praiseworthy though the fault in it is blameworthy so we must confess that all vituperation of vices is actually praise of the natures whose vices are blamed because vice is the enemy of nature the evil of a vice is greater in proportion to the damage done to the integrity of the nature when you blame a vice you thereby praise the thing which you would like to see undamaged you praise the nature of the thing regarded in its integrity nature is perfect not only is it free from blame but it deserves praise in its own order if you see anything lacking in the perfection of nature you call it a vice or fault by the very fact that you blame its imperfection you bear witness that you would be pleased with it if only it were perfect xv 42 if blame of vices is praise of the honour and dignity of the natures of which these are vices how much more is god to be praised even though there be these vices for he is the maker of all natures from him they derive their being as natures and they are vicious in so far as they depart from his purpose in creating them they are rightly blamed in so far as he who blames them sees the purpose in creating them and blames only that which is no longer to be seen in them the purpose with which they were all created that is the supreme and unchangeable wisdom of god truly and supremely is what he is see then whither things tend which depart from him but that defection would not be blameworthy if it were not voluntary would you be right in blaming anything which is as it ought to be i should think not it is to be blamed for not be ing as it ought no one owes what he has not received to whom is a debt owed if not to him from whom something has been received things returned by bequest are returned to him who made the bequest what is paid back to the legal successors of a creditor is really paid back to the original creditor in the persons of his legal successors otherwise there would be no paying back but a simple surrender of goods or a passing on of an inherit ance or whatever other name can be given to such a procedure wherefore all temporal things are so placed in this temporal order that they must come to an end if the future is to succeed to the past allowing the whole beauty of things in their tern on free will 97 poral sequence to be displayed it would be most absurd to say that they should not come to an end what they have received they traffic with and pay back to him to whom they owe their being in so far as it is being whoever laments that temporal things should come to an end should observe his own speaking take for example his lamentation which no doubt he thinks is just and proceeds from prudence so far as the sounds are con cerned which he utters in making it one has to come to an end and be followed by another so that the whole speech may be made if anyone loved one particular sound and did not want it to cease and give place to the others he would be adjudged astonishingly mad 43 in things which come to an end because it is not given them to last any longer so that all things may happen in their due times no one has the right to find fault with their coming to an end no one can say it ought to abide for it cannot pass its appointed bounds in rational creatures whether they sin or do not sin the beauty of the universe reaches its appropriate limit in them either there arc no sins which is absurd for he sins who condemns as sins what are not sins or sins are not to be blamed which is no less absurd for wrong actions will begin to be praised and the whole purpose of the human mind will be thrown into confusion and human life will be subverted or right action be blamed and execrable madness will arise or to use a milder expression a miserable error if right reason com pels us as it does to blame sins and to blame them because they ought not to be what they are ask yourself what debt sin ful nature owes and the answer will be right action ask your self to whom it owes the debt and the answer will be god from god it received the power to act rightly when it would from him also it received the alternatives misery if it acts un righteously happiness if it acts righteously 44 no man can overcome the laws of the omnipotent creator therefore it is not permitted to the soul to escape pay ment of its debt it pays it by making a good use of what it has received or by losing what it was unwilling to make a good use of if it docs not pay its debt by doing what it ought it will pay it by suffering misery in either case the word obligation is in order so we could thus amplify what we said if it does not pay its debt by doing what it ought it will pay it by suffering what it ought to suffer there is no interval of time between failure to do what ought to be done and suffering what ought to be suffered lest for a single moment the beauty of the universe 198 augustine earlier writings should be defiled by having the uncomeliness of sin without the comeliness of penalty what is now not punished openly is reserved for future judgment that the misery imposed may become manifest and be most sharply felt he who is not awake is asleep in the same way he who does not do what he ought immediately suffers what he ought for such is the happiness of doing justly that no one can depart from it without immediately finding misery in all deficiencies the things which are defec tive have not received power to last longer if they have no guilt likewise there is no guilt if they are what they are because they did not receive power to have an ampler existence or they may be unwilling to be what they have been given power to be if they would and because they have the power to be good there is guilt if they will not 45 god owes nothing to any man for he gives everything gratuitously if anyone says god owes him something for his merits god did not even owe him existence nothing could be owing to one who did not yet exist and what merit is there in turning to him from whom you derive existence that you may be made better by him from whom you derive existence why do you ask him for anything as if you were demanding repay ment of a debt if you were unwilling to turn to him the loss would not be his but yours for without him you would be nothing and from him you derive such existence as you have but on condition that unless you turn to him you must pay him back the existence you have from him and become not indeed nothing but miserable all things owe him first their existence so far as they are natural things and secondly that they can become better if they wish receiving additional gifts if they wish them and being what they ought to be no man is guilty because he has not received this or that power but be cause he does not do as he ought he is justly held guilty obligation arises if he has received free will and sufficient power 46 no blame attaches to the creator if any of his creatures does not do what he ought indeed that the wrong doer suffers as he ought redounds to the praise of the creator in the very act of blaming anyone for not doing as he ought he is praised to whom the debt is owed if you are praised for seeing what you ought to do and you only see it in him who is unchangeable truth how much more is he to be praised who has taught you what you ought to wish has given you the power to do it and has not allowed you to refuse to do it with impunity if ought ness depends upon what has been given and man has been so on free will 99 made that he sins by necessity then he ought to sin so when he sins he does what he ought but it is wicked to speak like that no man’s nature compels him to sin nor does any other nature no man sins when he suffers what he does not wish if he has to suffer justly he does not sin in suffering unwillingly he sinned in that he did something voluntarily which involved him in suffering justly what he did not wish if he suffers unjustly where is the sin there is no sin in suffering something unjustly but in doing something unjustly so if no one is compelled to sin either by his own nature or by another it remains that he sins by his own will if you want to attribute his sin to the creator you will make the sinner guiltless because he has simply obeyed the laws of the creator if the sinner can be rightly de fended he is not a sinner and there is no sin to attribute to the creator let us then praise the creator whether or not the sin ner can be defended if he is justly defended he is no sinner and we can therefore praise the creator if he cannot be defended he is a sinner so far as he turns away from the creator there fore praise the creator i find therefore no way at all and i assert that there is none to be found by which our sins can be ascribed to the creator our god i find that he is to be praised even for sins not only because he punishes them but also because sin arises only when a man departs from his truth evodius i most gladly approve all you have said and assent with all my heart to the truth that there is no way at all of rightly ascribing our sins to our creator xvii 47 but i should like to know if possible why those beings do not sin whom god knew beforehand would not sin and why those others do sin whom he foresaw would sin i do not now think that god’s foreknowledge compels the one to sin and the other not to sin but if there were no cause rational creatures would not be divided into classes as they are those who never sin those who continually sin and the intermediary class of those who sometimes sin and sometimes are turned towards well doing what is the reason for this division i do not want you to reply that it is the will that does it what i want to know is what cause lies behind willing there must be some reason why one class never wills to sin another never lacks the will to sin and another sometimes walls to sin and at other times does not so wail for they are all alike in nature i seem to see that there must be some cause for this three fold classification of rational beings according to their wills but what it is i do not know 48 augustine since will is the cause of sin you now ask 200 augustine earlier writings what is the cause of will if i could find one are you not going to ask for the cause of the cause i have found what limit will there be to your quest what end to inquiry and explanation you ought not to push your inquiry deeper for you must be ware of imagining that anything can be more truly said than that which is written avarice is the root of all evils i tim 6 io that is wanting more than is sufficient that is sufficient which is demanded by the need of preserving any particular creature avarice in greek philarguria derives its name from argentum silver because among the ancients coins were made of silver or more frequently with an admixture of silver but avarice must be understood as connected not only with silver and money but with everything which is immoderately desired in every case where a man wants more than is sufficient such avarice is cupidity and cupidity is an evil will an evil will therefore is the cause of all evils if it were according to nature it would preserve nature and not be hostile to it and so it would not be evil the inference is that the root of all evils is not according to nature that is sufficient answer to all who want to accuse nature but you ask what is the cause of this root how then will it be the root of all evils if it has a cause that cause will be the root of evil and if you find a cause as i said you will ask for a cause of that cause and there will be no limit to your inquiry 49 but what cause of willing can there be which is prior to willing either it is a will in which case we have not got beyond the root of evil will or it is not a will and in that case there is no sin in it either then will is itself the first cause of sin or the first cause is without sin now sin is rightly imputed only to that which sins nor is it rightly imputed unless it sins volun tarily i do not know why you should want to inquire further but here is a further point if there is a cause of willing it is either just or unjust if it is just he who obeys it will not sin if unjust he who does not obey it will not sin either xviii 50 but it may perhaps be violent and compel him against his will arc we to repeat our reply over and over again remember how much we have spoken earlier about sin and free will perhaps it is difficult to commit everything to memory but hold fast to this brief statement whatever be the cause of willing if it cannot be resisted no sin results from yielding to it if it can be resisted and it is not yielded to no sin results pos sibly it may deceive a man when he is off his guard let him lftin tint tn kp herpived is the deceotion so gfreat that on free will 201 he cannot possibly avoid it in that case no sin results no one commits sin in doing what there was no means of avoiding yes indeed sin does result and that means he is able to be on his guard 51 nevertheless some things are done in ignorance which are held to be wrong and worthy of correction as we read in the divinely authoritative books the apostle says t obtained mercy because i did it in ignorance i tim 1 13 and the prophet says remember not the sins of my youth and of my ignorance ps 25 7 wrong things are done by necessity when a man wills to do right and has not the power for thus it is written the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do again to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not rom yiis ig and again the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh for these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would gal 5 1 7 these are the words of men emerging from deadly damnation if this were a description of man’s nature and not of the penalty of sin liis situation would not be sinful if man has not departed from the natural state in which he was created and which could not be made better he is doing what he ought even when he does evil but now man might be good if he were different because he is what he now is he is not good nor is it in his power to become good either because he does not see what he ought to be or seeing it has not the power to be what he sees he ought to be who can doubt that his is a penal state every just penalty is the penalty of sin and is called punishment if the penalty is unjust there is no doubt that it is in fact penalty but it has been imposed on man by some unjust power that lords it over him but it is mad to have any doubt about the omnipotence or the justice of god therefore man’s penalty is just and is recompense for sin no unjust lord could have usurped dominion over man as it were without the knowledge of god no one could have forced him in his weakness against his will either by terrorism or by actual affliction 0 that man’s punishment might be held to be unjust it remains therefore that his punishment is just and comes to him because he is to be condemned 52 it is not to be wondered at that man through ignorance has not the freedom of will to choose to do what he ought or that he cannot see what he ought to do or fulfil it when he will in face of carnal custom which in a sense has grown as strong 202 augustine earlier writings almost as nature because of the power of mortal succession it is the most just penalty of sin that man should lose what he was unwilling to make a good use of when he could have done so without difficulty if he had wished it is just that he who knowing what is right does not do it should lose the capacity to to know what is right and that he who had the power to do what is right and would not should lose the power to do it when he is willing in fact there are for every sinful soul these two penal conditions ignorance and difficulty from ignorance springs disgraceful error and from difficulty comes painful effort to approve falsehood instead of truth so as to err in spite of himself and not to be able to refrain from the works of lust because of the pain involved in breaking away from fleshly bonds these do not belong to the nature of man as he was created they are the penalty of man as condemned when we speak of the freedom of the will to do right we are speaking of the freedom wherein man was created xix 53 here comes in the question which men who are ready to accuse anything for their sins except themselves are wont to cast up murmuring amongst themselves they say if adam and eve sinned what have we miserable creatures done to deserve to be born in the darkness of ignorance and in the toils of difficulty that in the first place we should err not knowing what we ought to do and in the second place that when the precepts of justice begin to be opened out to us we should wish to obey them but by some necessity of carnal lust should not have the power to them i reply keep quiet and stop murmuring against god they might perhaps rightly complain if no man had ever been victorious over error and lust and yet there is one present everywhere who in many ways by means of the creation that serves him as its lord calls back him who has gone astray teaches him who believes com forts him who has hope exhorts the diligent helps him who is trying and answers prayer you are not held guilty because you are ignorant in spite of yourself but because you neglect to seek the knowledge you do not possess you are not held guilty because you do not use your wounded members but because you despise him who is willing to heal them these are your own personal sins to no man is it given to know how to seek to his advantage what to his disadvantage he does not know he must humbly confess his weakness so that as he seeks and makes his confession he may come to ms aid who in aiding knows neither error nor difficulty on free will 1203 54 all that a man does wrongfully in ignorance and all that he cannot do rightly though he wishes are called sins because they have their origin in the first sin of the will when it was free these are its deserved consequences we apply the name tongue not only to the member which we move in our mouth when we speak but also to what follows from that motion namely words and language thus we speak of the greek or the latin tongue so we apply the word sin not only to that which is properly called sin that is what is committed know ingly and with free will but also to all that follows as the necessary punishment of that first sin so we use the word nature in a double sense properly speaking human nature means the blameless nature with which man was originally created but we also use it in speaking of the nature with which we are born mortal ignorant and subject to the flesh which is really the penalty of sin in this sense the apostle says we also were by nature children of wrath even as others eph 2 3 xx 55 as we are born from the first pair to a mortal life of ignorance and toil because they sinned and fell into a state of error misery and death so it most justly pleased the most high god governor of all things to manifest from the beginning from man’s origin his justice in exacting punishment and in human history his mercy in remitting punishment when the first man was condemned happiness was not so completely taken from him that he lost also his fecundity though his off spring was carnal and mortal yet in its own way it could con tribute some glory and ornament to the earth that he should beget children better than himself would not have been equit able but if any of adam’s race should be willing to turn to god and so overcome the punishment which had been merited by the original turning away from god it was fitting not only that he should not be hindered but that he should also receive divine aid in this way also the creator showed how easily man might have retained if he had so willed the nature with which he was created because his offspring had power to transcend that in which he was born 56 again if only one soul was originally created and the souls of all men since born derive their origin from it who can say that he did not sin when the first man sinned if how ever souls are created separately in individual men as they are born it appears not to be unreasonable but rather most appro priate and in accordance with right order that the ill desert of an earlier soul should determine the nature of those which are 204 augustine earlier writings created afterwards and that by its goodness a soul later created should deserve to regain the state which the earlier one had lost there would be nothing unworthy about it if the creator had determined to show in this way that the soul so far excelled in dignity every corporeal creature that one soul could start from the position to which another had fallen the sinful soul reached an estate of ignorance and toil which is rightly called penalty because before the penalty it had been better even if a soul before it sinned and even before it was born was given a nature like that which another acquired after a guilty life it has no small good for which to give thanks to its creator for even in its inchoate beginning it is better than any body how ever perfect these are no mean advantages not only to be a soul and so naturally to excel all bodies but also to have the power with the aid of the creator to cultivate itself and with pious care to acquire all the virtues by which it may be liberated both from tormenting toil and from blinding ignor ance if that is so in the case of souls that are born ignorance and toil will not be punishment for sin but a warning to im prove themselves and the beginning of their perfecting it is no small thing to have been given before there has been any merit gained by any good work the natural power to discern that wisdom is to be preferred to error and tranquillity to toil and to know that these good things are to be reached not simply by being born but by earnestly seeking them but if the soul will not act in this way it will rightly be held guilty of sin for not making a good use of the power it has received though it is born in ignorance and toilsomeness there is no necessity for it to remain in that state indeed it could not exist were not almighty god the creator of such souls for before he was loved he made them in love he restores them and being loved he perfects them to souls which do not yet exist he gives existence and to those who love him who gives them existence he gives happiness too 57 if on the other hand souls pre exist in some secret place and arc sent out to quicken and rule the bodies of individuals when they are born their mission is to govern well the body which is born under the penalty of the sin of the first man that is mortality they are to discipline it with the virtues and sub ject it to an orderly and legitimate servitude so that in due order and in the due time men may attain the place of heavenly perfection when they enter this life and submit to wealing mortal members these souls must also undergo forgetfulness of on free will 205 their former existence and the labours of their present existence with consequent ignorance and toil which in the first man were a punishment involving mortality and completing the misery of the soul but for these souls ignorance and toil are opportunities for ministering to the restoration of the integrity of the body the flesh coming from a sinful stock causes this ignorance and toil to infect the souls sent to it only in this sense are they to be called sins and the blame for them is to be ascribed neither to the souls nor to their creator for he has given them power to do good in difficult duties and has provided for them the way of faith where oblivion had brought blindness also and above ail he has given them the insight which every soul possesses that it must seek to know wffiat to its disadvantage it does not know and that it must persevere in burdensome duties and strive to overcome the difficulty of well doing and implore the creator’s aid in its efforts by the law without and by direct address to the heart within he has commanded that effort be made and he has prepared the glory of the blessed city for those who triumph over the devil who with wicked persuasion overcame the first man and reduced him to his state of misery that misery these souls undergo in lively faith in order to overcome the devil no little glory is to be gained from the campaign to overcome the devil w aged by undergoing the punishment which he glories in having brought upon his victim man whoever yields to love of the present life and takes no part in that campaign can by no means justly attribute the shame of his desertion to the command of his king rather the lord of all will appoint his place with the devil because he loved the base hire wherewith he bought his desertion 58 but if souls existing in some place are not sent by the lord god but come of their own accord to inhabit bodies it is easy to see that any ignorance or toil wffiich is the consequence of their own choice cannot in any way be ascribed as blame to the creator he would be entirely without blame if we accept the view that he himself sent souls he did not take from them even in the state of ignorance and toil their freedom to ask and seek and endeavour and wms ever ready to give to those who ask to demonstrate to those who seek and to open to those who knock similarly on this other view he would allow conquest over ignorance and difficulty on the part of earnest and right minded souls to count as a crowm of glory he would not lay the ignorance or the difficulty to the charge of the negligent or of those who vishcd to defend their sins on the ground of their 2o6 augustine earlier writings infirmity but he would justly punish them because they would rather abide in ignorance and difficulty than reach truth and a life free from struggle by zeal in seeking and learning and by humility in prayer and confession xxi 59 now there are these four opinions about the origin of the soul viz that it comes by propagation that it is newly created with each individual who is born that it exists some where beforehand and comes into the body of the newly born either being divinely sent or gliding in of its own accord none of these views may be rashly affirmed either that question because of its obscurity and perplexity has not been handled and illumined by catholic commentators on holy writ or if it has been done their writings have not come into our hands god give us a true faith that will hold no false or unworthy opinion concerning the substance of the creator for by the path of piety we are wending our way towards him if we hold any other opinion concerning him than the true one our zeal will drive us not to beatitude but to vanity there is no danger if we hold a wrong opinion about the creature provided we do not hold it as if it were assured knowledge we are not bidden to turn to the creature in order to be happy but to the creator himself if we are persuaded to think otherwise of him than we ought to think or otherwise than what is true we are deceived by most deadly error no man can reach the happy life by making for that which is not or if it does exist does not make men happy 60 that we may be able to enjoy and cleave to eternal truth in contemplation a way out of temporalities has been prepared for our weakness so that we may trust the past and the future so far as is sufficient for our journey towards eternal things the discipline of faith is governed by the divine mercy so that it may have supreme authority things present are perceived as transient so far as the creature is concerned they consist in the mobility and mutability of body and soul of these things we cannot have any kind of knowledge unless they enter into our experience if we are told on divine authority about the past or the future of any created thing we are to believe it with out hesitation no doubt some of this was past before we could have perceived it some of it has not yet reached our senses nevertheless we are to believe it for it helps to strengthen our hope and call forth our love inasmuch as it reminds us through the ordered temporal series that god does not neglect our liberation if any error assumes the role of divine authority on free will 207 it is most reasonably refuted if it is shown to hold or to affirm that there is any mutable form that is not the creation of god or that there is any mutability in the substance of god or if it contends that the substance of god is more or less than a trinity to understand that trinity soberly and piously occupies all the watchful care of christians and that is the goal of every advance concerning the unity of the trinity and the equality of persons and the properties of each this is not the place to discourse to relate some things which pertain to saving faith and which concern the lord our god author and maker and governor of all things may give useful support to a child like incipient purpose to rise from earthly to heavenly things that is easy to do and it has already been done by many but to handle the whole question so as to bring all human intelli gence into the light of clear reason as far as possible in this life does not seem an easy task for any man’s eloquence or even for any man’s thought much less ours it is therefore not to be lightly attempted let us go on with what we have begun so far as we have the permission and the help of god all that w e are told of past events concerning the creation and all that is foretold concerning the future is to be believed without hesita tion because it helps to commend pure religion by stimulating in us sincere love to god and our neighbour it is to be defended against unbelievers either by wearing down their unbelief with the weight of authority or by showing them as far as possible first that it is not foolish to believe it and secondly that it is foolish not to believe it but false doctrine not about past or future events so much as about the present and above all about unchangeable things must be convincingly refuted by clear reasoning so far as it is granted to us 61 of course when we are thinking of the series of temporal things expectation of things to come is more important than research into things past in the divine books also past events are narrated but they carry with them the forecast or promise or attestation of things to come in fact no one pays much atten tion to temporal prosperity or adversity when they are past all anxiety and care are bestowed on what is hoped for in the future by some intimate and natural mechanism of the mind things which have happened to us after they are past are accounted in any reckoning of felicity and misery as if they had never happened what disadvantage is it to me not to know when i began to be when i know that i exist now and do not cease to hope that i shall continue to exist i am not so 2o8 augustine earlier writings interested in the past as to dread as deadly errpr any false opinion i may entertain as to what actually transpired but as to my future i direct my course guided by the mercy of my maker but if i have any false belief or opinion about my future or about him with whom i am to be for ever i must with all my might beware of that error otherwise i shall not make the necessary preparation or i shall not be able to reach him who is the objective of my enterprise because my outlook has been confused if i were buying a garment it would be no disadvan tage to me to have forgotten last winter but it would be a dis advantage if i did not believe that cold weather was coming on so it would be no disadvantage to my soul to forget anything that it may perhaps have endured so long as it diligently ob serves and remembers all that may warn it to make preparation for the future for example it will do no harm to a man who is sailing to rome to forget from what shore he set sail so long as he knows all the time whither he is directing his course it will do him no good to remember the shore from which he began his voyage if he has made some false calculation about the port of rome and runs upon rocks so it is no disadvantage to me not to remember the beginning of my life so long as i know the end where i am to find rest nor would any memory or guess con cerning life’s commencement be of any advantage to me if holding unworthy opinions of god who is the sole end of the soul’s labours i should run upon the reefs of error 62 what i have said is not to be taken to mean that i forbid those who have the ability to inquire whether according to the divinely inspired scriptures soul is propagated from soul or whether souls are created separately for all animate beings whether they are sent at the divine behest from some place where they abide to animate and rule the body or whether they insinuate themselves of their own accord such inquiries and discussions are justifiable if reason demands them in order to answer some necessary question or if leisure from more neces sary matters is available i spoke as i did rather that no one in so great a problem should rashly become angry with another because he will not yield to his opinion having grounds for hesitation based perhaps on a broader culture or even that no one who has clear and certain understanding of these matters from scripture should suppose that another has lost all hope for the future because he does not remember the soul’s origin in the past xxii 6g however that may be whether that question is to on free will 209 be passed over entirely or to be deferred for later consideratioiij there is no obstacle preventing us from answering the question with which we are dealing at present in such a way as to make clear that by the upright just unshaken and changeless majesty and substance of the creator souls pay the penalty for their own sins these sins as we have explained at great length are to be ascribed to nothing but to their own vills and no further cause for sins is to be looked for 64 if ignorance and moral difficulty are natural to man it is from that condition that the soul begins to progress and to ad vance towards knowledge and tranquillity until it reaches the perfection of the happy life if by its own will it neglects to ad vance by means of good studies and piety for the capacity to do so is not denied to it it justly falls into a still graver state of ignorance and struggle which is now penal and is ranked among inferior creatures according to the appropriate and fitting government of the universe natural ignorance and natural impotence are not reckoned to the soul as guilt the guilt arises because it does not eagerly pursue knowledge and does not give adequate attention to acquiring facility in doing right it is natural for an infant not to know how to speak and not to be able to speak but that ignorance and inability are not only blameless according to the rules of the teachers but are also attractive and pleasing to human feeling in this case there is no faulty failure to acquire the power of speaking nor if possessed was it lost through any fault if we supposed that happiness was to be found in eloquence and it was thought criminal to commit a fault in speaking as it is thought criminal to commit a fault in action no one would put the blame on our infancy though as infants we began to acquire eloquence but clearly one would be deservedly blamed if by perversity of will one either remained in the infantile condition or fell back into it in the same way if ignorance of the truth and difficulty in doing right are natural to man and he has to begin to rise from that condition to the happiness of wisdom and tranquillity no one rightly blames him for the natural condition from which he started but if he refuses to progress or voluntarily falls back from the path of progress he will justly and deservedly pay the penalty 65 but his creator is to be praised on all counts he gave him the power to rise from such beginnings to ability to attain the chief good he renders aid as he advances he completes and perfects his advance and if he sins that is if he refuses to rise a w tat r a 210 augustine earlier writings from these beginnings to perfection or if he falls back from any progress he may have made he imposes on him a most just condemnation according to his deserts the soul was not created evil because it was not given all that it had power to become all corporeal things however perfect are far inferior to the soul’s beginning though anyone who takes a sane view of things judges that they too are to be praised in their own kind that the soul does not know what it should do is due to its not yet having received that gift it will receive it if it makes a good use of what it has received it has received the power to seek dili gently and piously if it will that it cannot instantly fulfil the duty it recognizes as duty means that that is another gift it has not yet received its higher part first perceives the good it ought to do but the slower and carnal part is not immediately brought over to that opinion so by that very difficulty it is admonished to implore for its perfecting the aid of him whom it believes to be the author of its beginning hence he becomes dearer to it because it has its existence not from its own resources but from his goodness and by his mercy it is raised to happiness the more it loves him from whom it derives its existence the more surely it rests in him and enjoys his eternity more fully we do not rightly say of a young shoot of a tree that it is sterile because several summers must pass before at the appointed time it re veals its fruitfulness why should not the author of the soul be praised with due piety if he has given it so good a start that it may by zeal and progress reach the fruit of wisdom and justice and has given it so much dignity as to put within its power the capacity to grow towards happiness if it will xxiii 66 against this reasoning ignorant men are wont to repeat a calumny based upon the deaths of infants and certain bodily torments with which we often see them afflicted they say what need had the infant to be born if it was to die before it had acquired any merit in life how is it to be reckoned in the future judgment seeing that it cannot be put among the just since it performed no good works nor among the evil because it never sinned i reply if you think of the all embracing com plexity of the universe and the orderly connection of the whole creation throughout space and time you will not believe that a man whatsoever he may be can be created superfluously why not even the leaf of a tree is created superfluously but it is idly superfluous to inquire about the merits of one who has done nothing to merit anything there is no need to fear lest there be a life lived which is neither righteous nor sinful nor on free will 2ii that the judge will be able to pronounce sentence involving neither reward nor punishment 67 at this point men are wont to ask what good the sacra ment of christ’s baptism can do to infants seeing that many of them die after having been baptized but before they can know anything about it in this case it is pious and right to believe that the infant is benefited by the faith of those who bring him to be consecrated this is commended by the salutary authority of the church so that everyone may realize how beneficial to him is his faith seeing that one man’s faith can be made bene ficial for another who has no faith of his own the son of the widow of nain could have had no advantage from any faith of his own for being dead he had no faith but his mother’s faith procured him the benefit of being raised from the dead luke 7 11 ff how much more may the faith of another bene fit an infant seeing that no faithlessness of its own can be imputed to it 68 a greater complaint and one with a show of pity about it is often occasioned by the bodily torments which infants suffer for by reason of their tender age they have committed no sins at least if the souls which animate them have had no existence prior to their birth as human beings people say what evil have they done that they should suffer such things as if innocence could have any merit before it has the power to do any hurt perhaps god is doing some good in correcting parents when their beloved children suffer pain and even death why should not such things happen when they are past they will be for those who suffered them as if they never happened and those on whose account they happened will be made better if they accept correction from temporal troubles and choose to live more righteously or if they will not allow the sufferings of this life to turn their desire towards eternal life they will be without excuse when they are punished at the last judgment by the torments of their children parents have their hard hearts softened their faith exercised and their tenderness proved who knows what good compensation god has reserved in the secrecy of his judgments for the children themselves who though they have not had the chance of living righteously at least have committed no sin and yet have sufiered not for nothing does the church commend for honour as martyrs the children who were slain by the orders of herod when he sought to slay the lord jesus christ 69 these casuists who ask questions of that kind not because 212 augustine earlier writings they want to examine them seriously but because they are loquacious and want to ventilate them are wont also to trouble the faith of the less learned by pointing to the pains and labours of animals what evil they say have the animals deserved that they suffer such woes or what good can they hope for in having such troubles imposed on them they say that or feel like that because they have a perverted sense of values they are not able to see what the chief good is and they want to have everything just as they conceive the chief good to be they can think of no chief good except fine bodies like the celestial bodies which are not subject to corruption and so without any sense of order they demand that the bodies of animals shall not suffer death or any corruption as if forsooth they were not mortal being lowly bodies or were evil because celestial bodies are better the pain which the animals suffer commends the vigour of the animal soul as admirable and praiseworthy after its own fashion by animating and ruling the body of the animal it shows its desire for unity for what is pain but a certain feeling that cannot bear division and corruption hence it is clearer than day that the animal soul is eager for unity in the whole body and is tenacious of unity neither gladly nor with indif ference but reluctantly and with obstinate resistance it meets bodily suffering which it is grieved to know destroys the unity and integrity of the body we should never know what eager ness there is for unity in the inferior animal creation were it not for the pain suffered by animals and if we did not know that we should not be made sufficiently aware that all things are framed by the supreme sublime and ineffable unity of the creator 70 indeed if you give pious and diligent attention every kind of creature which can come under the consideration of the human mind contributes to our instruction speaking by its diverse movements and feelings as in so many diverse tongues everywhere proclaiming and insisting that the creator is to be recognized there is no creature that feels pain or pleasure which does not by some sort of unity attain a beauty appro priate to its own kind or some sort of stability of nature there is no creature sensitive to pain or pleasure which does not simply by avoiding pain and seeking pleasure show that it avoids its own destruction and seeks unity in rational souls all desire for knowledge which is the delight of the rational nature refers its acquisitions to unity and in avoiding error avoids nothing so much as the confusion of incomprehensible am on free will 213 biguity why is ambi ity so detestable save that it has no certain unity hence it is clear that all things whether they offend or are offended whether they delight or are delighted proclaim or suggest the unity of the creator but if ignorance and moral difficulty from which we must set out on the rational life are not natural to souls they must be undertaken as a duty or imposed as a punishment i think we have said enough about these matters now xxiv 71 what sort of creature the first man was when created is a more important question than how his posterity was propagated people seem to pose a very acute question when they say if the first man was created wise why has he been seduced if he was created foolish how is god to escape being held to be the author of vice since folly is the greatest vice of all as if human nature might not receive some inter mediate quality which can be called neither folly nor wisdom man begins to be either foolish or wise and one or other of these terms must necessarily be applied to him as soon as it becomes possible for him to have wisdom or to neglect it then his will is guilty for his folly is his own fault no one is so foolish as to call an infant foolish though it would be even more absurd to call it wise an infant can be called neither foolish nor wise though it is already a human being so it appears that human nature receives an intermediate condition which cannot be rightly called either folly or wisdom similarly if anyone was animated by a soul disposed as men are who lack wisdom through negligence nobody could rightly call him foolish because he would owe his condition not to his own fault but to the nature with which he was endowed folly is not any kind of ignorance of things to be sought and avoided but ignorance which is due to a man's own fault we do not call an irrational animal foolish because it has not received the power to be wise yet we often apply terms improperly where there is some similarity blindness is the greatest fault that eyes can have yet it is not a fault in puppies and is not properly called blindness 72 if man was created such that although he was not yet wise he could at least receive a commandment which he ought to obey it is not surprising that he could be seduced nor is it unjust that he pays the penalty for not obeying the command ment nor is his creator the author of sins for it was not yet a sin in man not to have wisdom if that gift were not yet given him but he had something that would enable him to attain what he did not have provided he was willing to make a good 2x4 augustine earlier writings use of it it is one thing to be a rational being another to be a wise man reason makes a man able to receive the precept to which he ought to be loyal so that he may perform what is commanded the rational nature grasps the precept obedience to which brings wisdom what nature contributes to the grasping of the precept will contributes to obedience to it as the merit of receiving the precept so to speak is to have a rational nature so the merit of receiving wisdom is obedience to the precept as soon as a man begins to have the power to receive the precept he begins also to have the possibility of sinning before he becomes wise he sins in one or other of two ways either he does not fit himself to receive the precept or receiving it he does not obey it the wise man sins if he turns away from wisdom the precept does not come from him on whom it is laid but from him who gives it so wisdom too comes not from him who is illumined but from him who gives the light why then should not the creator of man be praised man is good and better than the cattle because he is capable of receiving the precept better still when he has received the precept and still better when he has obeyed it best of all when he is made happy by the eternal light of wisdom sin or evil consists in neglect to receive the precept or to obey it or to hold fast the contemplation of wisdom so we learn that even al though the first man had been created wise it was nevertheless possible for him to be seduced because his sin was committed with his free will a just penalty followed by divine law as the apostle paul says saying they are wise they have become fools rom 1 22 it is pride that turns man away from wisdom and folly is the consequence of turning away from wis dom folly is a kind of blindness as he says their foolish heart was darkened whence came this darkness if not from turning away from the light of wisdom and whence came the turning away if not from the fact that man whose good god is willed to be his own good and so to substitute himself for god accordingly the scriptures say looking to myself my soul is cast down ps 42 6 lxx and again taste and ye shall be as gods gen 3 5 73 some people are troubled by this question did folly cause the first man to depart from god or did he become foolish by departing from god if you answer that folly made him depart from wisdom it will appear that he was foolish before he did so so that folly is the cause of his doing so if you renlv that he became foolish by departing from wisdom they on free will 215 ask whether he acted foolishly or wisely in departing if wisely he did right and committed no sin if foolishly there was folly already in him they say which made him depart from wisdom for without folly he could do nothing foolishly clearly there is some middle state of transition from wisdom to folly which cannot be called either wisdom or folly but it is not given to men to understand this except by way of contrast with both no mortal becomes wise unless he passes from folly to wisdom if there is folly in the actual transition it is not a good thing but to say that would be mad if there is wisdom in it there must already be wisdom in a man before he makes the transition to wisdom but that is equally absurd hence we learn that there is an intermediate state which may be said to be neither folly nor wisdom in the same way when the first man passed from the citadel of wisdom to folly the transition in itself was neither foolish nor wise in the matter of sleeping and waking to be asleep is not the same thing as to fall asleep nor is to be awake the same thing as to awake there is a transitional state between sleeping and waking as between folly and wisdom but there is this difference in the former case there is no inter vention of will in the latter the transition never takes place except by the action of the will that is why the consequence is just retribution xxv 74 but the will is not enticed to do anything except by something that has been perceived it is in a man’s power to take or reject this or that but it is not in his power to control the things which will affect him when they are perceived we must admit therefore that the mind is affected by perceptions both of superior things and of inferior things thus the rational creature may take from either what it will and according to its deserts in making the choice it obtains as a consequence either misery or happiness in the garden of eden the commandment of god came to man’s attention from above from beneath came the suggestion of the serpent neither the commandment of god nor the suggestion of the serpent was in man’s power but if he has reached the healthy state of wisdom he is freed from all the shackles of moral difficulty and has freedom not to yield to the enticing suggestions of inferior things how free he is we can infer from the fact that even fools overcome them as they pass on to wisdom though of course they have the diffi culty of trying to do without the deadly sweetness of the per nicious things to which they have been accustomed 75 here it may be asked if man had impressions from both 2i6 augustine earlier writings sides from the commandment of god and from the suggestion of the serpent whence did the devil receive the suggestion to follow impiety which brought him down from his abode on high if there was nothing in his experience to affect him he would not have chosen to do what he did if nothing had come into his mind he would not have directed his purpose to wicked ness whence then did the thought come into his mind to attempt things which made of a good angel a devil whoever wills wills something he cannot exercise will unless some hint comes to him from outside through bodily sense or some thought comes into his mind in some secret way we must dis tinguish two kinds of experience one proceeds from the will of another who uses persuasion as for example when man sinned by consenting to the persuasion of the devil the other kind springs from environment mental and spiritual or corporeal and sensational the environment of the mind may be said to include the unchangeable trinity though the trinity rather stands high above the mind more properly the environment of the mind is first of all the mind itself which enables us to know that we live and secondly the body which the mind governs moving the appropriate limb to accomplish any action that may be required the environment of the senses is corporeal objects of all kinds 76 the mind is not sovereign wisdom for that is unchange able yet in contemplating sovereign wisdom the mutable mind may behold itself and in a fashion come to know itself but that cannot be unless a distinction is made the mind is not as god is and yet next to god it can give us satisfaction it is better when it forgets itself in love for the unchangeable god or in deed utterly contemns itself in comparison with him but if the mind being immediately conscious of itself takes pleasure in itself to the extent of perversely imitating god wanting to enjoy its owm power the greater it wants to be the less it becomes pride is the beginning of all sin and the beginning of man’s pride is revolt from god eccl 10 12 13 to the devil’s pride was added malevolent cn y so that he persuaded man to show the same pride as had proved the devil’s damnation so man had imposed on him a penalty which was corrective rather than destructive as the devil had offered himself to man as a pattern of pride to be imitated so the lord who promises us eternal life offered himself as a pattern of humility for our imitation now that the blood of christ is shed for us after un speakable toils and miseries let us cleave to our liberator with on free will 217 such love let us be so enraptured with his brightness that nothing coming into our experience from the lower realms may rob us of our vision of the higher things and if any suggestion springing from a desire for the inferior should deflect our pui pose the eternal damnation and torments of the devil will recall us to the true path 77 such is the beauty of justice such the pleasure of the eternal light that is of unchangeable truth and wisdom that even if we could not abide in it more than the space of a single day for that day alone innumerable years of this life full of delights and abundance of temporal goods would be rightly and deservedly despised deep and unfeigned is the emotion expressed in these words one day in thy courts is better than thousands ps 84 10 these words can be understood in an other sense thousands of days might be understood of mutable time and by the expression one day changeless eternity might be denoted i do not know whether i have omitted any point in replying as god has deigned to give me the power to your questions even if anything else occurs to you moderation com pels us now to bring this book to an end and to take some rest after this disputation of true religion st augustine s review of de vera religione retractations xiii i at that time also i wrote a book concerning true religion in which i argued at great length and in many ways that true religion means the worship of the one true god that is the trinity father son and holy spirit i pointed out how great was his mercy in granting to men by a temporal dispensation the christian religion which is true religion and how man is to adjust his life to the worship of god but the book is written chiefly against the two natures of the manichees 2 in a passage in that book chap x i say there could have been no error in religion had not the soul worshipped in place of god either soul or body or its own phantasms by soul here i meant the whole incorporeal creation i was not using the language of scripture which when it speaks of soul under that name seems to mean nothing but that which animates living beings including men so long as they are mortal a little later i put my meaning better and more briefly let us not serve the creature rather than the creator nor become vain in our thoughts by creature i indicated by one word both spiritual and corporeal creation and let us not become vain in our thoughts corresponds to the phantasms of the soul 3 again in the same chapter i said that is the christian religion in our times which to know and follow is most sure and certain salvation i was speaking of the name here and not of the thing so named for what is now called the christian religion existed of old and was never absent from the beginning of the human race until christ came in the flesh then true religion which already existed began to be called christian after the resurrection and ascension of christ into heaven the apostles began to preach him and many believed and the dis of true religion 219 ciples were first called christians in antioch as it is written when i said this is the christian religion in our times i did not mean that it had not existed in former times but that it received that name later 4 in another place i say listen to what follows as diligently and as piously as you can for god aids such this is not to be understood as if he aids the diligent and pious only he aids those who are not such to be such and to seek diligently and piously those who do so he aids so that they may find again i say chap xii after the death of the body which we owe to the first sin in its own time and order this body will be restored to its pristine stability that is to be accepted as par tially true the pristine stability of the body which by sinning we lost had so great felicity that it would not fall into the de cline of old age to this state the body will be restored at the resurrection of the dead but it will have more for it will not need to be sustained by material food it will be sufficiently animated by spirit alone when it is resurrected as a vivifying spirit for this reason also it will be spiritual man’s original nature though it would not have died if man had not sinned yet was made a living soul 5 in another place chap xiv i say sin is so much volun tary evil that there would be no such thing as sin unless it were voluntary that may appear a false definition but if it is diligently discussed it will be found to be quite true we are to consider as sin simply sin and not what is really the penalty of sin as i showed above when i was dealing with passages from the third book of the de libero arbitrio sins which are not un justifiably said to be non voluntary because they are committed in ignorance or under compulsion cannot be said to be com mitted entirely involuntarily he who sins in ignorance uses his will to some extent for he thinks he should do what in fact ought not to be done he who does not the things that he would because the flesh lusteth against the spirit may be unwilling but he lusts all the same and thereby does not the things he would if he is overcome he voluntarily consents to lust and thereby does what he wishes being free from righteousness and the servant of sin what we call original sin in infants who have not yet the use of free choice may not absurdly also be called voluntary because it originated in man’s first evil will and has become in a manner hereditary so my statement was not false by the grace of god not only is the guilt of past sins done away in all who are baptized in christ by the spirit of regeneration 220 augustine earlier writings but also in grown up people the will itself is healed and made ready by the lord by the spirit of faith pd love 6 in another place chap xvi i said of the lord jesus christ that he did nothing by violence but everything by per suasion and advice i had forgotten that he used a whip to drive the buyers and sellers from the temple but what does this amount to he also drove demons from men against their will not by persuasive speech but by the might of his power again i say chap xxv these are first to be followed who say that the most high true god is alone to be worshipped if the truth does not shine out among them then we must go elsewhere that would seem to suggest that there is some doubt about the truth of this religion i was adapting my words to the situation of him whom i was addressing i had no doubt myself that the truth would shine out among them the apostle says if christ be not raised never doubting that he was raised 7 again i said chap xxv these miracles were not permitted to last till our times lest the soul should always seek visible things and the human race should grow cold by becom ing accustomed to things which stirred it when they were novel that is true when hands are laid on in baptism people do not receive the holy spirit in such a way that they speak with the tongues of all the nations nor are the sick now healed by the shadow of christ’s preachers as they pass by clearly such things which happened then have later ceased but i should not be understood to mean that to day no miracles are to be believed to happen in the name of christ for when i wrote that book i myself had just heard that a blind man in milan had received his sight beside the bodies of the milanese martyrs protasius and gervasius and many others happen even in these times so that it is impossible to know them all or to enumerate those we do know 8 in another place chap xli i said as the apostle says all order is of god but the apostle does not use these very words though his meaning seems to be the same he actually says the things that are are ordained of god again i say let no one deceive us whatever is rightly blamed is rejected by comparison with what is better this is said of substances and natures which were under discussion not of good and bad actions again chap xlvi i say man is not to be loved by man as brothers after the flesh love or sons spouses relatives citizens that is temporal love we should not have any such of true religion 221 relationships which are contingent on birth and death if our nature had remained in the precepts and image of god and had not been condemned to corruption i completely dis approve of this notion of which i have already disapproved in reviewing the first book of my on genesis against the manichees it leads to the conclusion that the first pair would not have begotten offspring unless they had sinned as if it were necessary that the offspring of intercourse between man and woman should be born to die i had not yet seen that it was possible that children who would not die might be born of parents who would not die if human nature had not been changed for the worse by the first great sin in that case if fertility and felicity remained both in parents and in children men would have been born who were destined not to succeed parents who die but to reign with their parents in life up to the fixed number of the saints which god has predetermined if there were no sin or death these kinships and relationships would exist 9 in another place chap iv i say tending to one god and binding our souls to him alone religantes whence religion is supposed to be derived let us be without superstition the account which is given in these words of the derivation of the word religion pleased me best to be sure i was not unaware that authors of latin tongue have given another derivation from religere which is a composite verb from legere to choose religo seems the proper latin form following the analogy of eligo of true religion introduction t he de vera religione is dedicated to romanianus and was sent to him with a brief epistle epist 1 5 in 390 romanianusj a wealthy citizen of tagaste had be friended the young augustine and contributed financially to enable him to study in carthage during a business visit to milan he met augustine again and was one of those who dis cussed a plan to form a quasi monastic community for religious and philosophic inquiry conf vi 14 his son licentius was left with augustine as a pupil accompanied him to cassiciacum and took part in the early dialogues the contra academicos is also dedicated to romanianus and there ii iii 8 reference is made to the abilities and progress of his son there too the promise is given to discuss true religion with him should oppor tunity offer on augustine’s return to africa romanianus pressed for a fulfilment of the promise and offered to put his house at tagaste at the disposal of augustine and his friends the offer was gracefully refused the de vera religione was one of the five works of augustine sent to paulinus of nola in 394 which the latter delightedly hailed as his tentateuch against the manichees epist 25 in 415 in answer to queries ad dressed to him by evodius augustine refers to this work as also to the de libero arbitrio as containing in principle at least the solution to evodius difficulties epist 162 of the de vera religione it has been said scarcely any other of augustine’s works is of more value in demonstrating the greatness of his genius at the same time it must be admitted that it is extremely diffuse almost defying analysis the infer ence augustine wishes evodius to draw from it viz that reason cannot afford compelling proof of the existence of god i of true religion 223 hardly seems to emerge from the argument which is that god’s temporal dispensation in nature and in history is con gruous with supports and makes available for all men the platonic teaching with regard to nature and the good the christian religion now graciously revealed by god for man’s salvation is the true religion ineffectively glimpsed by plato and his followers giving a true account of man’s fall present condi tion and way of regeneration those who accept this can live the good life even under earthly conditions provided they look for blessedness to god alone the supreme good one may note the seminal idea of the de civitate dei in xxvii 50 analysis i i vi ii christ has achieved what plato sought in vain to do i true religion is the way of the blessed life and is incom patible with polytheism and idolatry 2 6 plato saw this afar off christ has made it generally available 7 platon ists unless smitten with envy are becoming christians 8 1 1 philosophers jews heretics schismatics only stimu late the thought of the catholic church vii 12 x 20 address to romanianus and outline of the argument 13 god’s temporal dispensation for man’s salvation rightly understood provides 14 16 a sure defence against all heresies especially manicheeism 18 root of all heresy is failure to distinguish between creator and creature 19 all creation obedient to the law of god bears witness to the eternal creator god has come to man’s aid in giving the christian religion 20 augustine’s varied experience in commending it xi 21 xxiii 44 the fall and redemption of man 21 25 the soul by disobedience is involved in material things and becomes carnal by god’s grace it can return to god even the body can be renewed 27 sin is voluntary and its penalty which includes moral inability is just but salvation is possible 30 christ honoured human nature by assuming it in order to liberate it 31 34 he taught and stt the standard of the perfect life 35 ff sin is loving the lower in place of the higher good and its cause is the mutability of the creature and disobedience to god’s command 42 beauty even in transient things e.g a poem 43 so also in 224 augustine earlier writings history only we are involved in history as parts of it and cannot see it whole 44 history is a process of purgation making for the salvation of the righteous and the final damnation of the impious xxiv 45 xxxviii 71 god’s methods of winning men from the temporal to the eternal a authority 45 51 b reason 52 71 a authority 45 authority prior in time to reason 46 belongs to those who call us to worship one god for unity is supreme 47 miracles necessary at the beginning of the church but not now 48 five stages of the natural life of the individual 49 seven stages of the spiritual life i.e putting off the old man and putting on the new man 50 world history from adam to the judgment two classes of men the regenerate and the impious their final destiny 51 the economy of the divine education of the human race in israel and in the church b reason 52 life superior to the inanimate 53 reason superior to life 54 58 above reason is the ideal world truth the eternal law god 59 64 difficulty in getting men to transcend sense knowledge 68 69 hence all idolatry and worse still the worship of the vices 71 the three temptations of christ show how vices are to be overcome xxxix 72 liv 106 reason sees the created universe as point ing to god 72 vestiges of truth everywhere even in bodily pleasures things enjoyed are good evil only as com pared with what is better 73 even to know that one doubts is the beginning of truth 74 there is good in all material processes even the lowest 76 the universe as a whole is beautiful even a worm has a beauty of its own 79 number in all things 84 the desire to excel is good even pride is a perverted imitation of almighty god 85 ff the desire to be unconquered has good in it especially if what is desired is to be unconquered by vice by loving men as they ought to be loved we conquer anger jealousy and partiality 94 curio sity is a perversion of the laudable desire to know the truth idle curiosity is sin but the desire to know god and the meaning of scripture is entirely good and the way of salva tion 106 the five talents in the parable are the five senses when they are well used an extra talent is given i.e power to understand eternal things iv 1 07 1 13 final exhortation to the worship of the one true god of true religion the text 1 i the way of the good and blessed life is to be found entirely in the true reli on wherein one god is worshipped and acknowledged with purest piety to be the beginning of all existing things originating perfecting and containing the universe thus it becomes easy to detect the error of the peoples who have preferred to worship many gods rather than the true god and lord of all things because their wise men whom they call philosophers used to have schools in disagreement one with another while all made common use of the temples the peoples and the priests knew quite well how divergent were the views of the philosophers concerning the nature of the gods for none shrank from publicly professing his opinion and indeed each endeavoured as far as he could to persuade everybody and yet all of them with their co sectaries in spite of their diverse and mutually hostile opinions came to the common religious rites none saying them nay now the question is not whose opinion was nearest to the truth but one thing so far as i can see is abundantly clear what the philosophers ob served along with the people in the way of religious rites was something quite different from what they defended in private or even in the hearing of the people ii 2 socrates is said to have been somewhat bolder than the others he swore by a dog or a stone or any other object that happened to be near lim or came to hand so to speak when he was to take an oath i suppose he knew how many natural ob jects produced and governed by divine providence are much better than the works of human artificers and therefore worthier of divine honours than are the images which are worshipped in the temples not that dogs and stones were rightly to be a.e.w 15 225 226 augustine earlier writings worshipped by wise men but that in this way all who had intelli gence might understand how sunk in superstition men are he wanted to show that an oath of this kind did represent an ad vance though not a very great one if men were ashamed to take this step they might at least see how shameful it was to re main in the still baser condition of religious practice to which they were accustomed at the same time those who supposed that the visible world was the supreme god were given to realize their turpitude for they were taught that any stone might be rightly worshipped as a particle of god most high if they saw that that was offensive they might change their minds and seek the one god who alone is superior to our minds and by whom clearly every soul and the whole world has been created plato afterwards wrote all this down making it pleasant to read rather than potent to persuade these men were not fit to change the minds of their fellow citizens and convert them from idolatrous superstition and worldly vanity to the true worship of the true god thus socrates himself venerated images along with his people and after his condem nation and death no one dared to swear by a dog or to call a stone jupiter these things were merely recorded and handed down to memory whether this was due to fear of punishment or to the influence of the times it is not for me to judge iii 3 this however i will say with complete confidence in spite of all who love so obstinately the books of the philosophen in christian times there can be no doubt at all as to which reli gion is to be received and held fast and as to where is the way that leads to truth and beatitude suppose plato were alive and would not spurn a question i would put to him or rather sup pose one of his own disciples who lived at the same time as he did had addressed him thus you have persuaded me that truth is seen not with the bodily eyes but by the pure mind and that any soul that cleaves to truth is thereby made happy and perfect nothing hinders the perception of truth more than a life devoted to lusts and the false images of sensible things de rived from the sensible world and impressed on us by the agency of the body which beget various opinions and errors therefore the mind has to be healed so that it may behold the immutable form of things which remains ever the same preserving its beauty unchanged and unchangeable knowing no spatial dis tance or temporal variation abiding absolutely one and the same men do not believe in its existence though it alone truly and supremely exists other things are born die are dissolved of true religion 227 or broken up but so far as they do exist they have existence from the eternal god being created by his truth to the rational and intellectual soul is given to enjoy the contemplation of his eternity and by that contemplation it is armed and equipped so that it may obtain eternal life so long as it is weakened by love of things that come to be and pass away or by pain at losing them so long as it is devoted to the custom of this life and to the bodily senses and becomes vain among vain images it laughs at those who say that there is something which cannot be seen by the eyes or conjured up by any phantasm but can be beheld by the mind alone by the intelligence you my master have persuaded me to believe these things now if some great and divine man should arise to persuade the peoples that such things were to be at least believed if they could not grasp them with the mind or that those who could grasp them should not allow themselves to be implicated in the depraved opinions of the multitude or to be overborne by vulgar errors would you not judge that such a man is worthy of divine honours i be lieve plato’s answer would be that could not be done by man unless the very virtue and wisdom of god delivered him from natural environment illumined him from his cradle not by human teaching but by personal illumination honoured him with such grace strengthened him with such firmness and ex alted him with such majesty that he should be able to despise all that wicked men desire to suffer all that they dread to do all that they marvel at and so with the greatest love and authority to convert the human race to so sound a faith but it is needless to ask me about the honours that would be due to such a man it is easy to calculate what honours are due to the wisdom of god being the bearer and instrument of the wisdom of god on behalf of the true salvation of the human race such a man would have earned a place all his own a place above all humanity 4 now this very thing has come to pass it is celebrated in books and documents from one particular region of the earth in which alone the one god was worshipped and where alone such a man could be born chosen men were sent throughout the entire world and by their virtues and words have kindled the fires of the divine love their sound teaching has been confirmed and they have left to posterity a world illumined but not to speak of ancient history which anyone may refuse to believe to day throughout the nations and peoples the pro clamation is made in the beginning was the word and the 228 augustine earlier writings word was with god and the word was god this was in the beginning with god and all things were made by him and without him was nothing made john i:i in order that men may receive the word love him and enjoy him so that the soul may be healed and the eye of the mind receive power to use the light to the greedy it is declared lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also matt 6 19 to the wanton it is said he who sows in the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption he who sows in the spirit shall of the spirit reap eternal life gal 6 8 to the proud it is said whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and whosoever humbleth him self shall be exalted luke 14 11 to the wrathful it is said thou hast received a blow turn the other cheek matt 5 39 to those who strive it is said love your enemies matt 5 44 to the superstitious the kingdom of god is within you luke 17 21 to the curious look not on the things which are seen but on the things which are not seen for the things which arc seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal 11 cor 4 18 finally to all it is said love not the world nor the things which are in the world for everything that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the ambition of this world i john 2 15 5 these things are read to the peoples throughout all the earth and are listened to most gladly and with veneration after all the christian blood shed after all the burnings and cruci fixions of the martyrs fertilized by these things churches have sprung up as far afield as among barbarian nations that thousands of young men and maidens contemn marriage and live in chastity causes no one surprise plato might have sug gested that but he so dreaded the perverse opinion of his times that he is said to have given in to nature and declared con tinence to be no sin views are accepted which it was once mon strous to maintain even as it is monstrous now to dispute them all over the inhabited world the christian rites are entrusted to men who are willing to make profession and to undertake the obligations required every day the precepts of christianity are read in the churches and expounded by the priests those who try to fulfioi them beat their breasts in contrition multitudes enter upon this way of life from every race forsaking the riches of true religion 229 and honours of the present world desirous of dedicating their whole life to the one most high god islands once deserted and many lands formerly left in solitude are filled with monks in cities and towns castles and villages country places and private estates there is openly preached and practised such a renuncia tion of earthly things and conversion to the one true god that daily throughout the entire world with almost one voice the human race makes response lift up your hearts to the lord why then do we still admiringly yearn for the darkness of yesterday and look for divine oracles in the entrails of dead cattle why when it comes to disputation are we so eager to mouth the name of plato rather than to have the truth in our hearts iv 6 those who think it a vain or even a wicked thing to despise the world of sense and to subject the soul to god most high that he may purge it with virtue must be refuted with a different argument if indeed they are worth disputing with but those who admit that that is a good ideal to be pursued should acknowledge god and submit to him who has brought it to pass that all nations now are persuaded that these things ought to be believed they would themselves have brought this to pass if they had had the power seeing they had not the power they cannot avoid the charge of envy let them then submit to him who has brought it to pass let them not be pre vented by inquisitiveness or by vain glory from recognizing the gap that subsists between the timid guesses of the few and the obvious salvation and correction of whole peoples if plato and the rest of them in whose names men glory were to come to life again and find the churches full and the temples empty and that the human race was being called away from desire for tem poral and transient goods to spiritual and intelligible goods and to the hope of eternal life and was actually giving its attention to these things they would perhaps say if they really were the men they are said to have been that is what we did not dare to preach to the people we preferred to yield to popular cus tom rather than to bring the people over to our way of thinking and living 7 so if these men could live their lives again to day they would see by whose authority measures are best taken for man’s salvation and with the change of a few words and sentiments they would become christians as many platonists of recent times have done if they would not admit this or do this but remained in their pride and envy i know not whether it would augustine earlier writings 230 be possible for them encumbered with these rags and bird lime to resort to the things they once said were to be sought and striven for i do not know whether such great men would have been prevented by the other vice which prevents present day pagans who now concern us from accepting the christian salvation for indeed it is utterly puerile i mean of course their curiosity in inquiring at demons v 8 however philosophers may boast anyone can easily understand that religion is not to be sought from them for they take part in the religious rites of their fellow citizens but in their schools teach divergent and contrary opinions about the nature of their gods and of the chief good as the multitude can testify if we could see this one great vice healed by the christian discipline no one should deny that that would be an achievement worthy of all possible praise innumerable heresies that turn aside from the rule of christianity testify that men are not admitted to sacramental communion who think and en deavour to persuade others to think otherwise of god the father of his wisdom and of the divine gift the holy spirit than as the truth demands so it is taught and believed as a chief point in man’s salvation that philosophy i.e the pursuit of wisdom cannot be quite divorced from religion for those whose doc trine we do not approve do not share in our sacramental rites 9 there is little to be surprised at in this in the case of men who have chosen to have different religious rites from ours such as the ophites whoever they may be or the manichaeans and others it is more noticeable in the case of those who celebrate similar religious rites but differ from us in doctrine and are more vigorous in defending their errors than careful to have them corrected these are excluded from catholic communion and from participation in our rites in spite of their similarity they have deserved to have names of their own and separate meetings being different not only in matters of words but also because of their superstition like the photinians the arians and many others it is another matter with those who have caused schisms the lord’s threshing floor might have kept them as chaff until the time of the last winnowing had they not in their levity been carried off by the wind of pride and separated from us of their own accord the jews it is true worship the one omnipotent god but they expect from him only temporal and visible goods being too secure they were unwilling to observe in their own scriptures the indications of a new people of god arising out of humble estate and so they remained in the old of true religion 231 man this being so religion is to be sought neither in the con fusion of the pagans nor in the offscourings of the heretics nor in the insipidity of schismatics nor in the blindness of the jews but only among those who are called catholic or orthodox christians that is guardians of truth and followers of right vi 10 this catholic church strongly and widely spread throughout the world makes use of all who err to correct them if they are willing to be aroused and to assist its own progress it makes use of the nations as material for its operations of heretics to try its own doctrine of schismatics to prove its stability of the jews as a foil to its own beauty some it invites others it excludes some it leaves behind others it leads to all it gives power to participate in the grace of god whether they are as yet to be formed or reformed admitted for the first time or gathered in anew its own carnal members i.e those whose lives or opinions are carnal it tolerates as chaff by which the corn is protected on the floor until it is separated from its covering on this floor everyone voluntarily makes himself either corn or chaff therefore every man’s sin or error is tolerated until he finds an accuser or defends his wicked opinion with pertinacious animosity those who are excluded return by way of penitence or in baleful liberty sink into wickedness as a warning to us to be diligent or they cause schisms to exercise our patience or they beget a heresy to try our intelligence or to quicken it by such ways carnal christians leave us for they could neither be corrected nor endured ii often too divine providence permits even good men to be driven from the congregation of christ by the turbulent seditions of carnal men when for the sake of the peace of the church they patiently endure that insult or injury and attempt no novelties in the way of heresy or schism they will teach men how god is to be served with a true disposition and with great and sincere charity the intention of such men is to return when the tumult has subsided but if that is not permitted because the storm continues or because a fiercer one might be stirred up by their return they hold fast to their purpose to look to the good even of those responsible for the tumults and commotions that drove them out they form no separate conventicles of their own but defend to the death and assist by their testimony the faith which they know is preached in the catholic church these the father who seeth in secret crowns secretly it appears that this is a rare kind of christian but examples are not lack ing indeed there are more than can be believed so divine augustine earlier writings 232 providence uses all kinds of men as examples for the oversight of souls and for the building up of his spiritual people vii 12 a few years ago my dear romanianus i promised to write down for you my sentiments concerning true religion i think the time has now come to do so in view of the love wherewith i am bound to you i can no longer allow your eager questions to run on endlessly repudiating all who do not carry philosophy into religious observance or philosophize in a religious spirit those also who wax proud in wicked opinions or some other cause of dissension and so deviate from the rule of faith and from the communion of the catholic church and those who refuse to own the light of the holy scripture and the grace of the spiritual people of god which we call the new testament all of whom i have censured as briefly as i could we must hold fast the christian religion and the communion of the church which is catholic and is called catholic not only by its own members but also by all its enemies whether they will or no heretics and schismatics use no other name for it than the name of catholic when they speak of it not among themselves but with outsiders they cannot make them selves understood unless they designate it by this name which is in universal use 13 in following this religion our chief concern is with the prophetic history of the dispensation of divine providence in time what god has done for the salvation of the human race renewing and restoring it unto eternal life when once this is believed a way of life agreeable to the divine commandments will purge the mind and make it jfit to perceive spiritual things which are neither past nor future but abide ever the same liable to no change there is one god father son and holy spirit when this trinity is known as far as it can be in this life it is perceived without the slightest doubt that every creature intel lectual animal and corporeal derives such existence as it has from that same creative trinity has its own form and is subject to the most perfect order it is not as if the father were under stood to have made one part of creation the son another and the holy spirit another but the father through the son in the gift of the holy spirit together made all things and every parti cular thing for every thing substance essence or nature or whatever better word there may be possesses at once these three qualities it is a particular thing it is distinguished from other things by its own proper form and it does not transgress the order of nature of true religion 233 viii 14 when this is known it will be as clear as it can be to men that all things are subject by necessary indefeasible and just laws to their lord god hence all those things which to begin with we simply believed following authority only we come to understand partly we see them as certain partly as possible and fitting and we become sorry for those who do not believe them and have preferred to mock at us for believing rather than to share our belief the holy incarnation the birth from a virgin the death of the son of god for us his resurrection from the dead ascension into heaven and sitting at the right hand of the father the forgiveness of sins the day of judgment the resurrection of the body are not merely believed when the eternity of the trinity and the mutability of created things are known they are also judged to be part and parcel of the mercy of the most high god which he has shown towards the human race 15 it has been truly said there must be many heresies that they which are approved may be made manifest among you i cor 11 19 let us also make use of that gift of divine providence men become heretics who would have no less held wrong opinions even within the church now that they arc outside they do us more good not by teaching the truth for they do not know it but by provoking carnal catholics to seek the truth and spiritual catholics to expound it there are in the holy church innumerable men approved by god but they do not become manifest among us so long as we are delighted with the darkness of our ignorance and prefer to sleep rather than to behold the light of truth so many are awakened from sleep by the heretics so that they may see god's light and be glad let us therefore use even heretics not to approve their errors but to assert the catholic discipline against their wiles and to become more vigilant and cautious even if we cannot recall them to salvation ix 16 1 believe that god will lend us his aid so that scrip ture being read by good men inspired by piety may avail not against one false and bad opinion only but against all but chiefly it is set against those who think that there are two natures or substances at war with one another each with its own prin ciple some things they like and others they dislike and they will have god to be the author of the things they like but not of those they dislike when they cannot overcome temptation and are snared in carnal traps they think there are two souls in one body one from god and sharing his nature the other fn m augustine earlier writings 234 the race of darkness which god neither begat nor made nor produced nor cast from him which has its own independent life its territory its offspring and living things in short its kingdom and unbegotten principle at a certain time it rebelled against god and god having no other resource and finding no other means of resisting the enemy under dire necessity sent the good soul hither a particle of his substance they fondly imagine that the enemy was subdued and the world fabricated by this soul becoming mixed up with the elements of darkness 17 i am not now refuting their opinions partly because i have already done so and partly because i intend to do so again if god permit in this work i am showing as far as i can with the arguments god deigns to supply how secure the catholic faith is against them and how the things which move men to give in to their opinions need not disturb the mind you know my mind very well and i want you above all to believe firmly that i do not make this solemn declaration with an arrogance which ought to be avoided i say whatever error is to be found in this book it alone is to be attributed to me whatever is truly and suitably expounded i owe entirely to god the giver of all good gifts x 18 let it be clearly understood that there could have been no error in religion had not the soul worshipped in place of its god either a soul or a body or some phantasm of its own pos sibly two of these together or all of them at once in this life the soul should have frankly accepted the temporal condition of human society but should have directed its regard to eternal things and worshipped the one god without whose changeless permanence no mutable thing could have any abiding existence anyone who studies his own emotions can learn that the soul is mutable not in space certainly but in time that body is mut able both in space and time is easy for anyone to observe phantasms are nothing but figments of corporeal shapes appear ing to bodily sense it is the easiest thing in the world to commit them to memory as they appear or by thinking about them to divide or multiply contract or expand set in order or dis turb or give them any kind of shape but when truth is being sought it is difficult to be on one’s guard against them and to avoid them 19 do not then let us serve the creature rather than the creator or become vain in our thoughts that is the rule of per fect religion if we cleave to the eternal creator we must neces of true religion 235 sarily be somehow affected by eternity but because the soul implicated in and overwhelmed by its sins cannot by itself see and grasp this truth if in human experience there were no intermediate stage whereby man might strive to rise above his earthly life and reach likeness to god god in his ineffable mercy by a temporal dispensation has used the mutable creation obedient however to his eternal laws to remind the soul of its original and perfect nature and so has come to the aid of individual men and indeed of the whole human race that is the christian religion in our times to know and follow it is the most secure and most certain way of salvation 20 this religion can be defended against loquacious persons and expounded to seekers in many ways omnipotent god may himself show the truth or he may use good angels or men to assist men of good will to behold and grasp the truth everyone uses the method which he sees to be suitable to those with whom he has to do i have given much consideration for a long time to the nature of the people i have met with either as carp ing critics or as genuine seekers of the truth i have also con sidered my own case both when i was a critic and when i was a seeker and i have come to the conclusion that this is the method i must use hold fast whatever truth you have been able to grasp and attribute it to the catholic church reject what is false and pardon me who am but a man what is doubtful believe until either reason teaches or authority lays down that it is to be rejected or that it is true or that it has to be believed always listen to what follows as diligently and as piously as you can for god helps men like that xi 21 there is no life which is not of god for god is supreme life and the fount of life no life is evil as life but only as it tends to death life knows no death save wickedness nequitid which derives its name from nothingness ne quidquam for this reason wicked men are called men of no worth a life therefore which by voluntary defect falls away from him who made it whose essence it enjoyed and contraiy to the law of god seeks to enjoy bodily objects which god made to be inferior to it tends to nothingness this is wickedness but not because the body as such is nothing a corporeal object has some concord between its parts otherwise it could not exist at all therefore it was made by him who is the head of all concord a corporeal object enjoys a certain degree of peace due to its having form without that it would be nothing therefore he is the creator of matter from whom all peace comes and who is 236 augustine earlier writings the uncreated and most perfect form matter participates in something belonging to the ideal world otherwise it would not be matter to ask therefore who created matter is to ask for him who is supreme in the ideal world for every idea comes from him who is he then save the one god the one truth the one salvation of all the first and highest essence from which all that exists derives existence as such for all existence as such is good 22 for that reason death does not come from god god did not create death nor does he take pleasure in the destruction of the living wisdom 1 13 the highest essence imparts existence to all that exists that is why it is called essence death imparts no actual existence to anything which has died if it is really dead it has indubitably been reduced to nothingness for things die only in so far as they have a decreasing part in existence that can be more briefly put in this way things die according as they become less matter is less than any kind of life since it is life that keeps even the tiniest quantity of matter together in any thing whether it be the life that governs any particular living thing or that which governs the entire universe of natural things matter is therefore subject to death and is thereby nearer to nothingness life which delights in material joys and neglects god tends to nothingness and is thereby iniquity xii 23 in this way life becomes earthly and carnal so long as it is so it will not possess the kingdom of god and what it loves will be snatched from it it loves what being matter is less than life and on account of the sinfulness of so doing the beloved object becomes corruptible is dissolved and lost to its lover even as it in loving a material thing has abandoned god it neglected his precepts eat this and do not eat that therefore it is punished for by loving inferior things it is given a place among the inferior creatures being deprived of its pleasures and afflicted with grief what is bodily grief but the sudden loss of integrity in something which the soul has made a bad use of so rendering it liable to corruption and what is spiritual grief but to lose mutable things which the soul enjoyed or hoped to be able to enjoy this covers the whole range of evil i.e sin and its penalty 24 if the soul while it continues in the course of human life overcomes the desires which it has fed to its own undoing by enjoying mortal things and believes that it has the aid of god’s grace enabling it to overcome them if it serves god with the mind and a good wiu it will undoubtedly be restored and will of true religion 237 return from the mutable many to the immutable one it will be re formed by the wisdom which is not formed but has formed all things and will enjoy god through the spirit which is the gift of god it becomes spiritual man judging all things and judged of none loving the lord its god with all its heart and all its soul and all its mind and loving its neighbour not carnally but as itself he loves himself spiritually who loves god with all that lives within him on these two commandments hang the whole law and the prophets matt 22 40 25 the consequence will be that after the death of the body which we owe to the primal sin in its own time and order the body will be restored to its pristine stability but it will owe its stability not to itself but to the soul whose stability is in god for the soul too owes its stability not to itself but to god whom it enjoys thus it has an ampler life than the body for the body lives by the soul and the soul by the immutable truth who is the only son of god so even the body lives by the son of god be cause all things live by him by god’s gift given to the soul i.e the holy spirit not only does the soul which receives it become sound and peaceful and holy but the body also will be vivified and will be cleansed completely the master himself said cleanse that which is within and that which is without shall be clean matt 23 26 and the apostle says he shall quicken your mortal bodies on account of the spirit that abideth in you rom 8 1 1 take away sin and sin’s penalty goes too and where is evil o death where is thy dctory o death where is thy sting being overcomes nothingness and so death is swallowed up in victory i cor 15 54 55 xiii 26 the evil angel who is called the devil will have no power over the sanctified even he so far as he is angel is not evil but only so far as he has been perverted by his own will we must admit that even angels are mutable if god alone is im mutable by willing to love god rather than themselves angels abide firm and stable in him and enjoy his majesty being gladly subject to him alone the bad angel loved himself more than god refused to be subject to god swelled with pride came short of supreme being and fell he became less than he had been because in wishing to enjoy his own power rather than god’s he wished to enjoy what was less he never had supreme existence for that belongs to god alone but he had an ampler existence than he has now when he enjoyed that which supremely is his present existence is not evil qua existence but so far as it is less ample than it formerly was to that extent he augustine earlier writings 238 tends towards extinction it is no marvel that his loss occasioned poverty and poverty envy which is the truly diabolical characteristic of the devil xiv 27 if the defect we call sin overtook a man against his will like a fever the penalty which follows the sinner and is called condemnation would rightly seem to be unjust but in fact sin is so much a voluntary evil that it is not sin at all unless it is voluntary this is so obvious that no one denies it either of the handful of the learned or of the mass of the unlearned we must either say that no sin has been committed or confess that it has been willingly committed no one can rightly deny that a soul has sinned who admits that it can be corrected by penitence that the penitent should be pardoned or that he who continues in sin is condemned by the just law of god lastly if it is not by the exercise of will that we do wrong no one at all is to be cen sured or warned if you take away censure and warning the christian law and the whole discipline of religion is necessarily abolished therefore it is by the will that sin is committed and since there is no doubt that sins are committed i cannot see that it can be doubted that souls have free choice in willing god judged that men would serve him better if they served him freely that could not be so if they served him by necessity and not by free will 28 the angels accordingly serve god freely that is to their advantage not god's god needs no good thing from others for all good comes from himself what is begotten of him is equally divine begotten not made things which are made need his good i.e the chief good the supreme essence they become less when by sin they are less attracted to him but they are never entirely separated from him otherwise they would not exist at all movements of the soul are the affections depending on the will bodily movements are movements in space man is said to have been persuaded by the wicked angel but even so it was his will that consented if he had consented by necessity he would have been held guilty of no sin xv 29 the human body was perfect of its kind before man sinned but after he had sinned it became weak and mortal though that was the just punishment for sin nevertheless it showed more of the clemency of the lord than of his severity we are thus admonished that we ought to turn our love from bodily pleasures to the eternal essence of truth the beauty of justice is in complete accord with the grace of loving kindness seeing that we who were deceived by the sweetness of inferior of true religion 239 goods should be taught by the bitterness of penalties for divine providence has so moderated our punishment that even in this corruptible body it is permitted to us to work towards righteous nessj to lay aside all pride and submit to god alone not to trust in ourselves but to commit ourselves to be ruled and defended by him alone so with god’s guidance a man of good will can turn the troubles of this present life to the advantage of courage among abounding pleasures and temporal prosperity he may prove and strengthen temperance in temptations he may sharpen his prudence that he may not only not be led into them but may also become more vigilant and more eager in his love of truth which alone never deceives xvi 30 to heal souls god adopts all kinds of means suitable to the times which are ordered by his marvellous wisdom i must not speak of these or at least they must be spoken of only among the pious and the perfect but in no way did he show greater loving kindness in his dealings with the human race for its good than when the wisdom of god his only son co eternal and consubstantial with the father deigned to assume human nature when the word became flesh and dwelt among us for thus he showed to carnal people given over to bodily sense and unable with the mind to behold the truth how lofty a place among creatures belonged to human nature in that he appeared to men not merely visibly for he could have done that in some ethereal body adapted to our weak powers of vision but as a true man the assuming of our nature was to be also its liberation and that no one should perchance suppose that the creator of sex despised sex he became a man born of a woman 31 he did nothing by violence but everything by persuasion and warning the old servitude was past and the day of liberty had dawned and man was fitly and helpfully taught how he had been created with free will by his miracles he being god pro duced faith in god and by his passion in the human nature he had assumed he furthered respect for human nature speaking to the multitudes as god he refused to recognize his mother when her coming was announced and yet as the gospel says he was obedient to his parents matt 12 48 luke 2 51 in his doctrine the god appeared and the man in the various stages of his life when as god he was about to turn water into wine he said woman depart from me what have i to do with thee my hour is not yet come john 2 4 but when his hour had come when as man he should die he recognized his mother 240 augustine earlier writings from the cross and commended her to the disciple whom he loved more than theothers john 19 26 27 the peoples to their own destruction sought riches that minister to pleasures he determined to be poor they panted for honours and empires he refused to be made a king they thought it a great boon to have sons after the flesh he scorned marriage and offspring in their great pride they dreaded insults he bore with insults of every kind they thought injuries were not to be endured what greater injury can there be than that a just and innocent man should be condemned they execrated bodily pain he was beaten and tortured they feared to die he was condemned to death they thought a cross the most shameful form of death he was crucified all the things which men unrighteously desired to possess he did without and so made them of no account all the things which men sought to avoid and so deviated from the search for truth he endured and so robbed them of their power over us there is no sin that men can commit which is not either a seeking of what he avoided or an avoiding of what he bore 32 his whole life on earth as man in the humanity he deigned to assume was an education in morals his resurrec tion from the dead showed that nothing of human nature can perish for all is safe with god it showed also how all things serve the creator either for the punishment of sin or for the liberation of man and how the body can serve the soul when the soul is subject to god when the body perfectly obeys the soul and the soul perfectly serves god not only is there no evil substance for that there can never be but better still sub stance cannot be affected by evil for it can be so affected only by sin or its punishment this natural discipline is worthy of the complete faith of less intelligent christians and for intelligent christians it is free from all error xvii 33 this method of teaching fulfils the rule of all rational discipline for as it teaches partly quite openly and partly by similitudes in word deed and sacrament it is adapted to the complete instruction and exercise of the soul the exposi tion of mysteries is guided by what is clearly stated if there was nothing that could not be understood with perfect ease there would be no studious search for truth and no pleasure in finding it if there were sacraments in scripture and if they were not signs and tokens of truth action would not be properly related to knowledge piety begins with fear and is perfected in love so in the time of servitude under the old law the people were of true religion 24i constrained by fear and burdened with many sacraments that was advantageous for them in that they might desire the grace of god which the prophets foretold would come when it came the wisdom of god having assumed human nature and called us into liberty few most salutary sacraments were appointed to maintain the society of the christian people i.e of the multi tude of those set free to serve the one god many things which were imposed upon the hebrew people i.e a multitude bound by law under the same god are no longer observed in prac tice but they remain valid for faith and are susceptible of allegorical interpretation they do not now bind in servile bonds but they afford the mind exercise in its freedom 34 whoever denies that both testaments come from the same god for the reason that our people are not bound by the same sacraments as those by which the jews were bound and still are bound cannot deny that it would be perfectly just and possible for one father of a family to lay one set of commands upon those for whom he judged a harsher servitude to be useful and a different set on those whom he deigned to adopt into the position of sons if the trouble is that the moral precepts under the old law are lower and in the gospel higher and that there fore both cannot come from the same god whoever thinks in this way may find difficulty in explaining how a single physician prescribes one medicine to weaker patients through his assis tants and another by himself to stronger patients all to restore health the art of medicine remains the same and quite un changed but it changes its prescriptions for the sick since the state of their health changes so divine providence remains entirely without change but comes to the aid of mutable creatures in various ways and commands or forbids different things at different times according to the different stages of their disease whether it be the vice which is the beginning of death or the final stage when death itself is imminent in all cases divine providence recalls to its true and essential nature whatever manifests defect i.e tends to nothingness and so strengthens it xviii 35 but you say why do they become defective because they are mutable why arc they mutable because they have not supreme existence and why so because they are inferior to him who made them who made them he who supremely is who is he god the immutable trinity made them through his supreme wisdom and preserves them by his supreme loving kindness why did he make them in order that a.e.w 16 augustine earlier writings 242 they might exist existence as such is good and supreme exist ence is the chief good from what did he make them out of nothing whatever is must have some form and though it be but a minimal good it will be good and will be of god the highest form is the highest good and the lowest form is the lowest good every good thing is either god or derived from god therefore even the lowest form is of god and the same may be said of species we rightly praise alike that which has form and that which has species that out of which god created all things had neither form nor species and was simply nothing that which by comparison with perfect things is said to be without form but which has any form at all however small or inchoate is not nothing it too in so far as it has any being at all is of god 36 therefore if the world was made out of some unformed matter that matter was made out of absolutely nothing if it was as yet unformed still it was at least capable of receiving form by god’s goodness it is tormable even capacity for form is good the author of all good things who gives form also gives the capacity for form all that exists receives existence from god and that which does not as yet exist but may do so receives its potential existence from god in other words all that is formed receives its form from god and from him all that is not yet formed receives power to be formed nothing has integrity of nature unless it be whole of its kind from god comes all wholeness as every good thing comes from him xix 37 he whose mental eyes are open and are not darkened or confused by zeal for vain verbal victory under stands easily that all things are good even though they become vitiated and die whereas vice and death are evil vice and death do no damage to anything except by depriving it of sound ness and vice would not be vice if it did no damage if vice is the opposite of wholeness no doubt wholeness is good all things are good which have vice opposed to them and vice vitiates them things which are vitiated are therefore good but are vitiated because they are not supremely good because they are good they are of god because they are not supremely good they are not god the good which cannot be vitiated is god all other good things are of him they can of themselves be vitiated because by themselves they are nothing god keeps them from being wholly vitiated or if vitiated makes them whole xx 38 the primal vice of the rational soul is the will to do of true religion 243 what the highest and inmost truth forbids thus was man driven from paradise into the present world i.e from eternal things to temporal from abundance to poverty from strength to weakness not however from substantial good to substantial evil for there is no substantial evil but from eternal good to temporal good from spiritual to carnal good from intelligible to sensible good from the highest to the lowest good there is therefore a good which it is sin for the rational soul to love because it belongs to a lower order of being the sin is evil not the substance that is sinfully loved the tree was not evil which we read was planted in the midst of paradise but the trans gression of the divine command was evil and as a consequence had its just condemnation but from the tree which was touched contrary to the prohibition came the power to distinguish be tween good and evil when the soul has become involved in its sin it learns by paying the penalty the difference between the precept it refused to obey and the sin which it committed in this way it learns by suffering to know the evil it did not learn to know by avoiding it by making comparison between its former and its present state it loves more earnestly the good which it loved too little as is seen from its failure to obey 39 vice in the soul arises from its own doing and the moral difficulty that ensues from vice is the penalty which it suffers that is the sum total of evil to do and to suffer have nothing to do with substance hence substance is not evil water is not evil nor is a creature that lives in the air but to throw oneself voluntarily into water and be suffocated as the drowned man is is evil an iron style which has one part for writing with and another part for making deletions is ingeniously manufactured and beautiful in its own way and most useful to us but if one wanted to write with the part intended for making deletions or to make a deletion with the writing end one would not cause the style to be evil one would rightly blame one’s own action correct the action and where will be the evil suppose one were suddenly to turn one’s eyes to look at the mid day sun the eyes would be dazzled and pained but neither the sun nor the eyes would for that reason be evil they are substances careless looking at the sun and the disturbance that is its conse quence is evil and there would be no evil if the eyes had been practised and made fit to look at the light nor is light evil when the light we see with our eyes is worshipped instead of the light of wisdom which is seen by the mind the superstition is evil that serves the creature rather than the creator and there 244 augustine earlier writings would be no such evil if the soul recognized its creator sub jected itself to him alone and understood that other things were made subject to it by him 40 every corporeal creature when possessed by a soul that loves god is a good thing of the lowest order and beautiful in its own way for it is held together by form and species if it is loved by a soul that neglects god not even so is it evil in itself but the sin of so loving it brings a penalty to him who so loves it it involves him in miseries and feeds him with fallacious pleasures which neither abide nor satisfy but beget torturing sorrows time in all the beauty of its changefulness holds on its appointed course and the thing desired escapes him who loved it it torments him by passing beyond his power to sense it and disturbs his mind with errors for it makes him suppose that the material object which the flesh had wrongly delighted in and which he had known through the uncertain senses was the primal form when in fact it was the lowest form of all so that when he thinks he believes he understands being deluded by shadowy phantasms if he does not hold fast to the whole dis cipline of divine providence but imagines he does and tries to resist the flesh he merely reaches the images of visible things he vainly excogitates vast spaces of light exactly like ordinary light which he sees has fixed limits here and promises himself a future habitation there he does not know that he is still en tangled in the lust of the eye and that he is carrying this world with him in his endeavour to go beyond it he thinks he has reached another world simply by falsely imagining the bright part of this world infinitely extended one could do the same not only with light but also with water wine honey gold silver even with the flesh blood and bones of animals and other like things there is no bodily object seen singly which cannot in thought be infinitely multiplied and there is nothing which as we see it occupies a small space which cannot by the same faculty of imagination be infinitely extended it is very easy to execrate the flesh but very difficult not to be carnally minded xxi 41 by this perversity of the soul due to sin and punish ment the whole corporeal creation becomes as solomon says vanity of them that are vain all is vanity what advantage has man in all his labour which he does under the sun eccl 1 2 not for nothing does he say of them that are vain for if you take away vain persons who pursue that which is last as if it were first matter will not be vanity but will show its own beauty in its own way a low type of beauty of course but not of true religion 245 deceptive when man fell away from the unity of god the multi tude of temporal forms was distributed among his carnal senses and his sensibilities were multiplied by the changeful variety so abundance became laborious and his needs if one may say so became abundant for he pursues one thing after another and nothing remains permanently with him so what with his corn and wine and oil his needs are so multiplied that he can not find the one thing needful a single and unchangeable nature seeking which he would not err and attaining which he would cease from grief and pain for then he would have as a consequence the redemption of his body which no longer would be corrupted as it is the corruption of the body burdens the soul and its earthly habitation forces it to think of many things for the humble beauty of material objects is hurried along in the order in which one thing succeeds another the reason why corporeal beauty is the lowest beauty is that its parts cannot all exist simultaneously some things give place and others succeed them and all together complete the number of temporal forms and make of them a single beauty xxii 42 but all this is not evil because it is transient a line of poetry is beautiful in its own way though no two syllables can be spoken at the same time the second cannot be spoken till the first is finished so in due order the end of the line is reached when the last syllable is spoken the previous ones are not heard at the same time and yet along with the preceding ones it makes the form and metrical arrangement complete the art of versifying is not subject to change with time as if its beauty was made up of measured quantities it possesses at one and the same time all the rules for making the verse which consists of successive syllables of which the later ones follow those which had come earlier in spite of this the verse is beautiful as exhibiting the faint traces of the beauty which the art of poetry keeps steadfastly and unchangeably 43 some perverse persons prefer a verse to the art of versify ing because they set more store by their ears than by their intelligence so many love temporal things and do not look for divine providence which is the maker and governor of time loving temporal things they do not want the things they love to pass away they are just as absurd as anyone would be who when a famous poem was being recited wanted to hear one single syllable all the time there are no such hearers of poems but there are multitudes of people who think in this way about historical events there is no one who cannot easily hear a whole 246 augustine earlier writings verse or even a whole poem but there is no one who can grasp the whole order of the ages besides we are not involved as parts in a poem but for our sins we are made to be parts of the secular order the poem is read for us to judge of it the course of history is made up of our labours no one who is vanquished in competitive games finds pleasure in them but they are honour able because of his dishonour here is a sort of parable of the truth for no other reason are we kept from such spectacles than lest we should be deceived by the shadows of things and wander from the things themselves whereof they are shadows so the condition and government of the universe displeases only im pious and damned souls and in spite of their misery it pleases many who are victorious upon earth or who look on in heaven without any risk nothing that is just displeases a just man xxiii 44 every rational soul is made unhappy by its sins or happy by its well doing every irrational soul yields to one that is more powerful or obeys one that is better or is on terms of equality with its equals exercising rivals or harming any it has overcome every body is obedient to its soul so far as per mitted by the merits of the latter or the orderly arrangement of things there is no evil in the universe but in individuals there is evil due to their own fault when the soul has been regener ated by the grace of god and restored to its integrity and made subject to him alone by whom it was created its body too will be restored to its original strength and it will receive power to possess the world not to be possessed by the world then it will have no evil for the lowly beauty of temporal changes will not involve it for it will have been raised above change there will be as it is written a new heaven and a new earth and there souls will not have to do their part in toiling but will reign over the universe all things are yours says the apostle and ye are christ’s and christ is god’s i cor 3 21 23 and again the head of the woman is the man the head of the man is christ and the head of christ is god i cor 11 3 accord ingly since the vice of the soul is not its nature but contrary to its nature and is nothing else than sin and sin’s penalty we understand that no nature or if you prefer it no substance or essence is evil nor does the universe suffer any deformity from the sins and punishments of its soul rational substance which is clear of all sin and subject to god dominates other things which are subject to it but rational substance which has committed sin is appointed to be where it is fitting so that all things should be glorious god being the maker and ruler of the of true religion 247 universe the beauty of the created universe is free from all fault because of these three things the condemnation of sinners the proving of the just and the perfecting of the blessed xxiv 45 the treatment of the soul which god’s providence and ineffable loving kindness administers is most beautiful in its steps and stages there are two different methods authority and reason authority demands belief and prepares man for reason reason leads to understanding and knowledge but reason is not entirely absent from authority for we have got to consider whom we have to believe and the highest authority belongs to truth when it is clearly known but because we dwell among temporal things and love of them is an obstacle to our reaching eternal things a kind of temporal medicine calling not those who know but those who believe back to health has priority by the order not of nature or its inherent excellence but of time wherever a man falls there he must lie until he is raised up so we must strive by means of the carnal forms which detain us to come to know those of which carnal sense can bring us no knowledge and by carnal sense i mean eyes ears and other bodily senses to carnal or corporeal forms boys must necessarily and lovingly adhere adolescents almost necessarily but with increasing years the necessity disappears xxv 46 divine providence not only looks after individuals as it were privately but also after the whole human race pub licly how it deals with individuals god knows who does it and they also know with whom he deals but how he deals with the human race god has willed to be handed down through history and prophecy the trustworthiness of temporal things whether past or future can be believed rather than known by the intelligence it is our duty to consider what men or what books we are to believe in order that we may rightly worship god wherein lies our sole salvation here the first decision must be this are we to believe those who summon us to the worship of many gods or those who summon us to worship one god who can doubt that we ought rather to follow those who summon us to worship one god especially since the wor shippers of many gods agree that there is one god who rules all things at least the numerical series begins from the number one those therefore are to be followed who say that the one most high god is the only true god and is to be worshipped alone if the truth does not shine out brightly among them then but not till then must we go elsewhere in the realm of nature there is a presumption of greater authority when all things arc 248 augustine earlier writings brought into unity in the human race a multitude has no power unless by consent i.e agreement in unity so in religion the authority of those who summon us to unity ought to be greater and more worthy of being believed 47 another thing which must be considered is the dissension that has arisen among men concerning the worship of the one god we have heard that our predecessors at a stage in faith on the way from temporal things up to eternal things followed visible miracles they could do nothing else and they did so in such a way that it should not be necessary for those who came after them when the catholic church had been founded and diffused throughout the whole world on the one hand miracles were not allowed to continue till our time lest the mind should always seek visible things and the human race should grow cold by becoming accustomed to things which when they were novelties kindled its faith on the other hand we must not doubt that those are to be believed who proclaimed miracles which only a few had actually seen and yet were able to per suade whole peoples to follow them at that time the problem was to get people to believe before anyone was fit to reason about divine and invisible things no human authority is set over the reason of a purified soul for it is able to arrive at clear truth but pride does not lead to the perception of truth if there were no pride there would be no heretics no schismatics no circumcised no worshippers of creatures or of images if there had not been such classes of opponents before the people was made perfect as promised truth would be sought much less eagerly xxvi 48 this is the tradition concerning god’s temporal dispensation and his providential care for those who by sin had deservedly become mortal first consider the nature and educa tion of any individual man who is born his first age infancy is spent in receiving bodily nourishment and it is to be entirely forgotten when he grows up then follows childhood when we begin to have some memories to this adolescence succeeds when nature allows propagation of offspring and fatherhood after adolescence comes young manhood which must take part in public duties and be brought under the laws now sins are more strictly forbidden and sinners have to undergo the servile coercion of penalty in carnal souls this of itself causes more dreadful onsets of lust and wrong doing is redoubled for sin has a double aspect it is not merely wrong doing it is dis obedience after the labours of young manhood a little peace of true religion 249 is given to old age but it is an inferior age lacking in lustre weak and more subject to disease and it leads to death this is the life of man so far as he lives in the body and is bound by desires for temporal things this is called the old man and the exterior or earthly man even if he obtain what the vulgar call felicity in a well ordered earthly city whether ruled by kings or princes or laws or all of them together for without these things no people can be well ordered not even a people that pursues earthly goods even such a people has a measure of beauty of its own 49 1 have described the old or exterior or earthly man he may be a moderate man after his kind or he may transgress the measure of servdle justice some live thus from the beginning to the end of their days but some begin in that way as they necessarily must but they are reborn inwardly and with their spiritual strength and increase of wisdom they overcome the old man and put him to death and bring him into subjection to the celestial laws until after visible death the whole is re stored this is called the new man the inward and heavenly man whose spiritual ages are marked not according to years but according to his spiritual advance in the first stage he is taught by the rich stores of history which nourish by examples in the second stage he forgets human affairs and tends towards divine things he is no longer kept in the bosom of human authority but step by step by the use of reason he strives to reach the highest unchangeable law in the third stage he con fidently marries carnal appetite to strong reason and inwardly rejoices in the sweetness of the union soul and mind are joined together in chaste union there is as yet no compulsion to do right but even though no one forbids sin he has no pleasure in sinning the fourth stage is similar only now he acts much more firmly and springs forth as the perfect man ready to endure and overcome all the persecutions tempests and billows of this world in the fifth stage he has peace and tranquillity on all sides he lives among the abundant resources of the unchange able realm of supreme ineffable wisdom the sixth stage is complete transformation into life eternal a total forgetfulness of temporal life passing into the perfect form which is made according to the image and likeness of god the seventh is eternal rest and perpetual beatitude with no distinguishable ages as the end of the old man is death so the end of the new man is eternal life the old man is the man of sin but the new man is the man of righteousness 250 augustine earlier writings xxvii 50 no one doubts that these two lives are related as follows a man can live the whole of this life as the old and earthly man but no one in this life can live as the new and heavenly man but must associate with the old man for he must begin there and must so continue till death though the old grows weaker and the new progresses similarly the entire human race whose life like the life of an individual from adam to the end of the world is so arranged by the laws of divine providence that it appears divided among two classes in one of these is the multitude of the impious who bear the image of the earthly man from the beginning to the end of the world in the other is the succession of the people devoted to the one god but from adam to john the baptist they live the life of the earthly man under a certain form of righteousness their history is called the old testament having the promise of a kind of earthly kingdom which is nothing but the image of the new people and the new testament with the promise of the kingdom of heaven meantime the life of this people begins with the coming of the lord in humility and goes on till the day of judgment when he will come in all clearness after the judg ment the old man will come to an end and there will take place the change that betokens the angelic life for we shall all be raised but we shall not all be changed i cor 15 51 the pious people will be raised as they transform the remnants of the old man that cling to them into the new man the impious people who have kept the old man from the beginning to the end will be raised in order to be precipitated into the second death those who read diligently can make out the divisions of the ages they have no horror of tares or chaff for the impious lives with the pious and the sinner with the righteous so that by com paring the two men may more eagerly rise to seek perfection xxviii 51 if any of the earthly people at any time had the merit of reaching the illumination of the inward man he gave to the human race in his day his aid showing it what that age required hinting by prophecy what it was not opportune to show clearly such were the patriarchs and the prophets so those discover who do not behave like children but who diligently and piously handle this good and great secret of the divine human relations in the time of the new people i see that this has been most carefully provided by great and spiritual men for the nurselings of the catholic church they are not to treat publicly of what they know is not seasonable to be handled before the people they earnestly feed the multitude of of true religion 25i those who are weak and needy with copious supplies of milky food and the few who are wise they feed with stronger meats they speak wisdom among the perfect but from the carnal and the psychics though they be new men they keep some things back because they are still children but they never lie they do not look to vain honours and vain praise for themselves but to the advantage of those with whom they have deserved to be associated in this life this is the law of divine providence that no one is to receive assistance from his superiors to know and grasp the grace of god unless he is prepared with a pure affection to assist his inferiors to the same so out of our sin which our nature committed in the first sinful man the human race is made the great glory and ornament of the world and is so properly governed by the provisions of divine providence that the art of god’s ineffable healing turns even the foulness of sin into something that has a beauty of its own xxix 52 we have said enough for the present about the benefit of authority let us see how far reason can advance from visible to invisible things in its ascent from temporal to eternal things we should not vainly behold the beauty of the sky the order of the stars the brightness of light the alternations of day and night the monthly courses of the moon the fourfold seasons of the year the meeting of the four elements the life force of seeds begetting forms and numbers and all thin that keep their nature and their appropriate measure each in its own kind in considering these things there should be no exercise of vain and perishing curiosity but a step should be taken towards im mortal things that abide for ever the first thing to notice is living nature which senses all these things because it gives life to the body it must necessarily excel the body no mass of matter however great or however bright is to be held of much account if it is without life any living substance is by the law of nature to be preferred to any inanimate substance 53 no one doubts that irrational animals also live and feel so in the human mind the most excellent part is not that which perceives sensible objects but that which judges of sensible ob jects many animals see more sharply and have a keener sense of corporeal objects than men have but to judge of bodies be longs not to life that is merely sentient but to life that has also the power of reasoning where the animals are lacking there is our excellence it is easy to see that that which judges is superior to that which is judged for living reason judges not only of sensible things but also of the senses themselves it knows why 252 augustine earlier writings the oar dipped in water must appear crooked though it is really straight and why the eyes must see it in that way ocular vision can only tell us that it is so but cannot judge wherefore it is manifest that as the life of sense excels the body the life of reason excels both xxx 54 if rational life judges by itself alone then there is nothing more excellent but clearly it is mutable since it can be skilled at one moment and unskilled at another the more skilled it is the better it judges and its skill is in proportion to its participation in some art discipline or wisdom now we must ask what is the nature of an art by an art in this context i would have you understand not something that is observed by experience but something that is found out by reason there is nothing very remarkable in knowing that sand and lime bind stones more securely together than mud or that he who would build elegantly must put a feature that is to be unique in the middle of the building and if there are several features they must be made to correspond like with like that is sense know ledge but it is not far from reason and truth we must indeed inquire what is the cause of our being dissatisfied if two windows are placed not one above the other but side by side and one of them is greater or less than the other for they ought to have been equal while if they are placed one directly above the other even though they are unlike the inequality does not offend us in the same way why don’t we notice very much how much the one is greater or less than the other if there are three windows sense itself seems to demand either that they should not be unequal or that between the largest and the smallest there should be an intermediate one as much larger than the smallest as it is smaller than the largest in this way we take counsel with nature as it were to see what she approves and here we must observe how that which displeases us only a little when we simply look at it is rejected when we compare it with what is better thus we discover that art in the popular sense is nothing but the memory of things we have experienced and which have given us pleasure with the addition of some skilled bodily activity if you lack the skill you can still judge of the works produced even though you cannot produce them and the power of judging is much better 55 in all the arts it is symmetry that gives pleasure pre serving unity and making the whole beautiful symmetry demands unity and equality the similarity of like parts or the graded arrangements of parts which are dissimilar but who can of true religion 253 find absolute equality or similarity in bodily objects who would venture to say after due consideration that any body is truly and simply one all are changed by passing from form to form or from place to place and consist of parts each occupying its own place and extended in space true equality and simili tude true and primal unity are not perceived by the eye of flesh or by any bodily sense but are known by the mind how is equality of any kind demanded in bodies and how are we convinced that any equality that may be seen there is far dif ferent from perfect equality unless the mind sees that which is perfect if indeed that which is not made facta can be called perfect perfectd 56 all things which are beautiful to the senses whether they are produced by nature or are worked out by the arts have a spatial or temporal beauty as for example the body and its movements but the equality and unity which are known only by the mind and according to which the mind judges of cor poreal beauty by the intermediary of the senses are not extended in space or unstable in time it would be wrong to say that a wheel can be judged to be round by this standard while a little jar cannot or ajar can but a penny cannot so in the case of times and motions of corporeal things it would be ridiculous to say that years can be judged by any standard to be of equal length but months cannot or that months can and days cannot whether a proper movement occupies a larger space of time or is measured by hours or brief minutes all are judged by one and the same standard of changeless equality if greater and smaller movements and spatial figures are all judged according to the same standard of equality or similitude or fitness the standard is greater than all of them in potency but it is neither greater nor less in a spatial or a temporal sense if it were greater we should not use the whole of it to judge things that are less if it were smaller we could not use it to judge things that are larger as it is we use the absolute standard of squareness to judge the squareness of a market place a stone a table or a gem and we use the absolute standard of equality to judge the movements of the feet of a running ant and those of an elephant on the march who then can doubt that it is neither greater nor less in a spatial or temporal sense but in potency surpasses all else this standard of all the arts is absolutely unchangeable but the human mind which is given the power to see the standard can suffer the mutability of error clearly then the standard which is called truth is higher than our minds augustine earlier writings 254 xxxi 57 we must not have any doubt that the unchange able substance which is above the rational mind is god the primal life and primal essence is where the primal wisdom is this is unchangeable truth which is the law of all the arts and the art of the omnipotent artificer in perceiving that it cannot judge by itself the form and movement of bodies the soul ought at the same time to realize that its nature excels the nature of what it judges but also that it is excelled by the nature according to which it judges and concerning which it cannot judge i can say why the corresponding members of a single body one on the one side and the other on the other ought to be alike because i delight in absolute equality which i behold not with the bodily eyes but with the mind and therefore i judge that things seen with the eyes are better the nearer they are in their own kind to the things which i know wdth my mind no one can say why these intelligible things should be as they are and no one in his sober senses should say that they ought to be as they are as if they could be otherwise 58 no one if he rightly understands the matter will venture to say why intelligible things please us and why when we are wise we earnestly love them as we and all rational souls rightly judge of inferior creatures when we judge according to truth so truth alone judges of us when we cleave to it not even the father judges of truth for it is not less than he is what the father judges he judges by means of the truth all things which seek unity have this rule or form or example or whatever it is to be called for unity alone bears the whole similitude of him from whom it has received existence if it is not incongruous to say it has received existence in view of the significance which attaches to the word son in any case it derives its existence not from itself but from the first and highest principle which is called the father from whom the whole family in heaven and on earth is named eph 3 15 the father therefore judgeth no man but hath given all judgment to the son john 5 22 the spiritual man judgeth all things and is himself judged of none i cor 2 15 that is by no man but only by the law according to which he judges all things wherefore it is most truly said we must all appear before the judgment throne of christ ii cor 5 10 he judges all things because he is above all when he is with god he is with god when he knows most purely and loves what he knows with all charity accordingly the law is that according to which he judges all things and con cerning which no man can judge in the case of temporal laws of true religion 255 men have instituted them and judge by them and when they have been instituted and confirmed no judge may judge them but niust judge according to them he who draws up temporal laws if he is a good and wise man takes eternal life into account and that no soul may judge he determines for the time being what is to be commanded and forbidden according to the im mutable rules of eternal life pure souls may rightly know the eternal law but may not judge it the difference is that for knowing it is enough to see that a thing is so and not so for judging it is necessary in addition to see that a thing can be thus or not thus as when we say it ought to be thus or to have been thus or to be thus in the future as workmen do with their works xxxii 59 but many stop with what delights men and are unwilling to rise to higher things so that they may judge why visible things give pleasure if i ask a workman why after con structing one arch he builds another like it over against it he will reply i dare say that in a building like parts must corre spond to like if i go further and ask why he thinks so he will say that it is fitting or beautiful or that it gives pleasure to those who behold it but he will venture no further he will bow and direct his eyes downward and not understand the cause for all this but if i have to do with a man with inward eyes who can see the invisible i shall not cease to press the query why these things give pleasure so that he may dare to be the judge of human pleasure he transcends it and escapes from its control in judging pleasure and not according to pleasure first i shall ask him whether things are beautiful because they give pleasure or give pleasure because they are beautiful then i shall ask him why they are beautiful and if he is perplexed i shall add the question whether it is because its parts correspond and are so joined together as to form one harmonious whole 60 when he sees that that is so i shall ask whether they completely achieve the unity they aim at or fall far short of it and in a measure misrepresent it no one who is put on his guard can fail to see that there is no form or material thing which does not have some trace of unity or that no material thing however beautiful can possibly achieve the unity it aims at since it must necessarily have its parts separated by intervals of space if this is so i shall ask him to tell me where he sees that unity and what is its source and if he cannot see it how does he know what it is that material things imitate but cannot com pletely achieve if he says of material things you would not 256 augustine earlier writings exist unless some kind of unity held you together but on the other hand if you were unity itself you would not be material things the correct reply would be whence have you acquired the knowledge of unity according to which you judge material things unless you had seen it you would not be able to judge that they come short of it you would not be right to say that you see it with your bodily eyes although things do show traces of it but they come nowhere near it with the bodily eyes you see nothing but corporeal things therefore it is with the mind that we see true unity but where if it were here where our body is it would not be visible to a man who in eastern parts judges in the same way about corporeal things it is not then circumscribed by space it is present wherever anyone judges in this way it is nowhere present spatially but its potency is nowhere absent xxxiii 61 if corporeal things travesty unity we must not trust things that deceive lest we fall into the vanities of them that are vain since they deceive by appearing to show to the eye of flesh the unity which is seen by the mind alone we must rather ask whether they deceive by resembling unity or in failing to achieve unity if they achieved it they would be com pletely identical with what they imitate in that case there would be no difference at all if that were so there would be no deception they would be exactly what unity is in any case if you consider the matter closely they do not actively deceive he is a deceiver who wants to appear what he is not he who without willing it is thought to be other than he is is not a deceiver but simply causes mistakes this is how a deceiver is distinguished from one who causes mistakes every deceiver has the will to deceive whether he is believed or not but mistakes can be caused by one who has no intention to deceive therefore a corporeal form which can have no will of its own does not deceive nor does it cause mistakes if it is not thought to be what it is not 62 even the eyes do not cause mistakes for they can report nothing to the mind except what they actually see if not only the eyes but also all the bodily senses report simply as they are affected i know not what more we ought to expect of them if there are no vain people there will be no vanity anyone who thinks that the oar is broken in the water and is restored when it is taken out has nothing wrong with his senses but he is a bad judge of what they convey to him by nature he could have seen nothing else in the water nor ought he to have seen anything of true religion 257 else air and water differ so it is proper that sensations should be different according as they relate to things in air and in water so the eye does its duty correctly for it was made simply to see but the mind operates perversely for it and not the eye was made to contemplate supreme beauty such a man as we have been speaking of wants to turn his mind to corporeal things and his eyes to god he seeks to know carnal things and to see spiritual things but that is impossible xxxiv 63 that perversity must be corrected otherwise things are all out of order up is down and down is up such a man will not be fit for the kingdom of heaven do not let us seek the highest in the lowest nor cleave to the lowest let us judge these things lest we be judged along with them let us attribute to them no more than as lowest forms they deserve lest seeking the first in the last we be numbered with the last instead of with the first that is no disadvantage to these lowest things but is a great disadvantage to us the divine providential government is not on that account any less fitting because the unjust are put in their just place and the foul are fairly dealt with if the beauty of visible things causes us to make mistakes because it consists in unity but does not completely achieve unity let us understand if we can that the mistake arises not from what they are but from what they are not every corporeal thing is a true body but a false unity for it is not supremely one and does not completely imitate unity and yet it would not be a body either if it did not have some unity besides it could have no unity unless it derived it from supreme unity 64 obstinate souls give me a single man who can see without being influenced by imaginations derived from things seen in the flesh give me a single man w ho can see that there is no principle of unity but that alone from which all unity derives whether it be complete unity or not point me out one who sees not one who merely cavils and wants to appear to see what he does not see give me a man who can resist the carnal senses and the impressions which they impose on the mind one who can resist human custom and human praise who suffers the stings of conscience on his bed and restores his soul who loves not external vanities nor seeks lies who can say to himself if there is only one rome which some romulus is said to have founded on the tiber that is a false rome which i conjure up in my thoughts my imaginary rome is not the real rome nor am i really there otherwise i should know what was taking place a.e.w 17 258 augustine earlier writings there if there is one sun that is a false one which i conjure up in thought for the real sun pursues its course in its appointed place and time the imaginary sun i place where and when i will if my friend is one i conjure up a false image i do not know where the real one is but the imaginary one is where i like to put him i myself am one person and i feel that my body is here but in imagination i go where i like and speak to whom i like these imaginary things are false and what is false cannot be known when i contemplate them and believe in them i do not have knowledge because what i contemplate with the intelligence must be true and not by any possibility what are commonly called phantasms whence then is my mind full of illusions where is the truth which the mind beholds it can be replied to one who thinks in this way that that is the true light which enables you to know that these things are not true by the true light you see the unity whereby you judge whatever you see to be one but it is quite a diferent thing from any mutable thing you can see xxxv 65 if your mind eagerly pants to behold these things keep quiet do not strive except against being accus tomed to material things conquer that habit and you are vic torious over all we seek unity the simplest thing of all there fore let us seek it in simplicity of heart be still and know that i am god ps 46 10 this is not the stillness of idleness but of thought free from space and time swelling fleeting phantasms do not permit us to see abiding unity space offers us something to love but time steals away what we love and leaves in the soul crowds of phantasms which incite desire for this or that thus the mind becomes restless and unhappy vainly trying to hold that by which it is held captive it is summoned to stillness so that it may not love the things which cannot be loved without toil so it will master them it will hold them and not be held by them my yoke says the lord is light matt 11 30 he who is subject to that yoke has everything else subject to himself he will not labour for what is subject does not resist men could be masters of this world if they were willing to be the sons of god for god has given them the power to become his sons but the unhappy friends of this world so fear to be separated from its embrace that nothing is more toilsome to them than to be at rest xxxvi 66 whoever clearly sees that falsehood is thinking something is what it is not knows that truth is that which de clares what is if material things deceive us in so far as they fall of true religion s259 short of the unity which they demonstrably imitate we naturally approve them for that is the principle from which all unity derives and to resemble which all things strive we equally disapprove all that departs from unity and tends towards its opposite we can understand that there is something so resem bling the sole unity and principle of all unity that it coincides with it and is identical with it this is truth the word that was in the beginning in principio the divine word that was with god if falsehood springs from things which imitate unity not in so far as they imitate it but in so far as they cannot achieve it the truth which does achieve it and is identical with it is unity and manifests unity as it is in reality hence it is rightly called unity’s word and light other things may be said to be like unity in so far as they have being and so far they are also true but this is itself the complete likeness of unity and is therefore truth truth makes all things true which are true and likeness makes things like which are alike truth is the form of all things which are true and likeness of all things which are alike since things are true in so far as they have being and have being in so far as they resemble the source of all unity that is the form of all things that have being which is the supreme likeness of the principle it is also perfect truth because it is without any unlikeness 67 falsehood arises not because things deceive us for they can show the beholder nothing but their form and that they have received according to their position in the scale of beauty nor do the senses deceive us for when they are in contact with natural objects they report to their presiding mind nothing but the impressions formed upon them it is sin which deceives souls when they seek something that is true but abandon or neglect truth they love the works of the artificer more than the artificer or his art and are punished by falling into the error of expecting to find the artificer and his art in his works and when they cannot do so they think that the works are both the art and the artificer god is not offered to the corporeal senses and transcends even the mind xxxvii 68 this is the origin of all impiety of sinners who have been condemned for their sins not only do they wish to scrutinize the creation contrary to the commandment of god and to enjoy it rather than god’s law and truth that was the sin of the first man who misused his free will but in their state of condemnation they also make this addition to their sin they not only love but also serve the creature rather than the creator 26o augustine earlier writings and wonhip the parts of the creation from the loftiest to the lowliest some worship the soul in place of the most high god the first intellectual creature which the father made by means of the truth that it might ever behold the truth and beholding the truth might also behold himself whom the truth resembles in every way next men come to the living creature through which god eternal and unchangeable makes things visible and tem poral in the realm of becoming then they slip further down and worship animals and even material things among which they first choose the more beautiful above all the heavenly bodies some are satisfied with the sun the most obvious of the heavenly bodies others think the moon worthy of religious veneration because of its brightness it is nearer to us we are told and so is felt to have a form that is closer to us others add the rest of the stars and the sky as a whole with its constellations others join the air to the ethereal sky and make their souls subordinate to these two superior corporeal elements but those think them selves most religious who worship the whole created universe that is the world with all that is in it and the life which inspires and animates it which some believe to be corporeal others in corporeal the whole of this together they think to be one great god of whom all things are parts they have not known the author and maker of the universe so they abandon themselves to idols and forsaking the works of god they are immersed in the works of their own hands all of them visible things xxxviii 69 there is another worse and lower idolatry which worships phantasms whatever the erring soul in its swelling pride can imagine they hold as an object of religious worship until at last some conclude that nothing at all should be worshipped and that men err who allow themselves to get involved in superstition and miserable servitude but these opinions are vain they cannot make themselves free there remain the vices and they are drawn towards the notion of worshipping them they are slaves of desire in three forms desire of pleasure desire of excelling desire of novel entertain ment i say that there is no man who holds that there is nothing he ought to worship who is not the slave of carnal pleasures or seeks vain power or is madly delighted by some showy spec tacle so without knowing it they love temporal things and hope for blessedness therefrom whether he will or no a man is necessarily a slave to the things by means of which he seeks to be happy he follows them whithersoever they lead and fears anyone who seems to have the power to rob him of them now a of true religion 261 spark of fire or a tiny animal can do that in short not to men tion innumerable adverse possibilities time itself must snatch away all transient things now since the world includes all temporal things those who think to escape servitude by not worshipping anything are in fact the slaves of all kinds of worldly things in their present extremity unhappy men are so placed that they allow their vices to lord it over them and are condemned for their lust pride or curiosity or for two of them or all together nevertheless so long as they are in this stadium of human life they may attack these vices and overcome them if they begin by believing what they cannot yet grasp with the understanding and thereby cease to love the world as it is written all that is in the world is lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and ambition of this world i john 2 16 three classes of men are thus distinguished for lust of the flesh means those who love the lower pleasures lust of the eyes means the curious and ambition of this world denotes the proud 71 the threefold temptation of the man whom the truth assumed has given us an example for our warning bid these stones that they become bread says the tempter to which our one and only teacher replies man does not live by bread alone but by every word of god matt 4 3 4 so he taught that desire for pleasure should be brought under and that we should not yield even to hunger but possibly some one who could not be overcome by the pleasures of the flesh could be by the pomp of temporal domination so all the kingdoms of the world were shown and the tempter said all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me to this it was replied thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve matt 4 9 10 so was pride trodden under foot more over the utmost enticements of curiosity were also overcome for the only reason for urging him to cast himself down from the pinnacle of the temple was that he might have a remarkable experience not even so was he overcome but in order that we should understand that to know god there is no need to explore divine power by subjecting it to visible experiments he replied thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god matt 4 7 where fore he who is inwardly fed upon the word of god does not seek pleasure in the desert he who is subject to the one god does not seek glory on the mountain that is in earthly elation he who begins to cleave to the eternal spectacle of unchange able truth is not thrown down by the pinnacle of the body that is the eyes to seek to know inferior and temporal things 262 augustine earlier writings xxix 72 what obstacle then remains to hinder the soul from recalling the primal beauty which it abandoned when it can make an end of its vices the wisdom of god extends from end to end with might by wisdom the great artificer knit his works together with one glorious end in view his goodness has no grudging envy against any beauty from the highest to the lowest for none can have being except from him alone so that no one is utterly cast away from the truth who has in him the slightest vestige of truth what is it about bodily pleasure that holds us fast you will find that it is agreeableness disagreeable things beget grief and agreeable things beget pleasure seek therefore the highest agreeableness do not go abroad return within yourself in the inward man dwells truth if you find that you are by nature mutable transcend yourself but remem ber in doing so that you must also transcend yourself even as a reasoning soul make for the place where the light of reason is kindled what does every good reasoner attain but truth and yet truth is not reached by reasoning but is itself the goal of all who reason there is an agreeableness than which there can be no greater agree then with it confess that you are not as it is it has to do no seeking but you reach it by seeking not in space but by a disposition of mind so that the inward man may agree with the indwelling truth in a pleasure that is not low and carnal but supremely spiritual 73 if you do not grasp what i say and doubt whether it is true at least make up your mind whether you have any doubt about your doubts if it is certain that you do indeed have doubts inquire whence comes that certainty it will never occur to you to imagine that it comes from the light of the sun but rather from that true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world it cannot be seen with these eyes nor with the eyes which seem to see the phantasms of the brain but with those that can say to phantasms you are not the thing i am seeking nor are you the standard by which i put you in your rightful place disapproving of all that is base in you and approving of all that is beautiful the standard according to which i approve and disapprove is still more beautiful so i approve more highly of it and prefer it not only to you but to all those bodily shapes from which you spring now think of the rule in this way everyone who knows that he has doubts knows with certainty something that is true namely that he doubts he is certain therefore about a truth therefore everyone who doubts whether there be such a thing as the truth has at least a of true religion 263 truth to set a limit to his doubt and nothing can be true except truth be in it accordingly no one ought to have doubts about the existence of the truth even if doubts arise for him from every possible quarter wherever this is seen there is light that trans cends space and time and all phantasms that spring from spatial and temporal things could this be in the least destroyed even if every reasoner should perish or grow old among inferior carnal things reasoning does not create truth but discovers it before it is discovered it abides in itself and when it is discovered it renews us xl 74 so the inward man is reborn and the outward man decays day by day the inward man regards the outward man and sees that he is base by comparison nevertheless in his own kind he is beautiful and rejoices in what is convenient for the body destroying what he converts to his own good e.g the nourishment he takes for the sake of his body that which is destroyed i.e loses its form passes into the workshop of his members nourishes what needs nourishment and is trans formed as is suitable somehow the processes of life make a selection some things which are suitable are assumed into the structure of the visible body and make it beautiful those which are not suitable are cast out by appropriate means the most filthy part is returned to the earth to assume other forms something is exhaled by the whole body another part receives the latent numerical qualities of the living person and is fitted to result in offspring prompted by the agreement of two bodies or by some like phantasm it flows from the genital organs in basest pleasure though not without the co operation of the head within the mother over a fixed period of time it takes shape and the members assume their proper place and func tion and if they preserve their proper measure and symmetry and colour is added a body is born which is called comely and is keenly loved by those who take delight in it but what gives pleasure is not so much the mobile form as the life which causes the mobility for if the child loves us it strongly attracts us if it hates us we are angry and cannot endure it even though its form be such as we might enjoy all this is the realm of pleasure and of beauty of the lowest grade it is subject to corruption otherwise it would be mistaken for the supreme beauty 75 divine providence is at hand to show that the beauty of the human form is not evil because it exhibits manifest traces of the primal numbers though divine wisdom is not numbered 264 augustine earlier writings among them but also that it is beauty of the lowest grade for mixed up with it are griefs and diseases distortions of limbs darkness of colour and conflicts and dissensions of mind by these things we are admonished that we must seek something unchangeable these evils providence brings about by the agency of inferior beings who find their pleasure in doing this and whom the divine scriptures call avengers and ministers of wrath though they themselves do not know the good that is being done by means of them like these are men who rejoice in the miseries of others and make sport and mocking spectacles by subverting others or by leading them astray in all these things the good are admonished and exercised and they are victorious triumphant and regal but the bad are deceived and tortured they are vanquished condemned and made to be slaves not of the one most high lord of all but of his lowest servants the bad angels who feed upon the griefs and misery of the damned and in return for their malevolence are tortured when they see the good set free 76 all have their offices and limits laid down so as to ensure the beauty of the universe that which we abhor in any part of it gives us the greatest pleasure when we consider the universe as a whole when we are judging a building we ought not to consider one angle only so when we are judging a good looking man we should not take account only of his hair and with one who is making a good speech we should not merely pay attention to the motion of his hands when we are thinking of the moon’s course we should not study its phases over a period of merely three days the very reason why some things are inferior is that though the parts may be imperfect the whole is perfect whether its beauty is seen stationary or in movement it must all be considered if we wish to reach a right judgment if our judgment concerning the whole or the part is true it is also beautiful it is superior to the whole world and in so far as our judgment is true we cling to no part of the world when we are wrong and pay exclusive attention to the part our judgment is in itself base the colour black in a picture may very well be beautiful if you take the picture as a whole so the entire con test of human life is fittingly conducted by the unchanging providence of god who allots different roles to the vanquished and the victorious the contestants the spectators and the tran quil who contemplate god alone in all these cases there is no evil except sin and sin’s penalty that is a voluntary abandon ment of highest being and toil among inferior beings which is of true religion 2 5 not voluntary in other words freedom from justice and slavery under sin xli 77 the outward man is destroyed either by the pro gress of the inward man or by his own failure when he is destroyed by the progress of the inward man the whole man is reformed and made better and is restored to his integrity at the last trump no longer will he corrupt or be corrupted by his own failure he is cast down among corruptible beauties which rank as penalties do not be surprised if i still call them beautiful things for everything is beautiful that is in due order as the apostle says all order is of god rom 13 2 we must admit that a weeping man is better than a happy worm and yet i could speak at great length without any falsehood in praise of the worm i could point out the brightness of its colouring the slender rounded shape of its body the fitness of its parts from front to rear and their effort to preserve unity as far as is possible in so lowly a creature there is nothing any where about it that does not correspond to something else that matches it what am i to say about its soul animating its tiny body even a worm’s soul causes it to move with precision to seek things suitable for it to avoid or overcome difficulties as far as possible having regard always to the sense of safety its soul hints much more clearly than its body at the unity which creates all natures i am speaking of any kind of living worm many have spoken fully and truly in praise of ashes and dung what wonder is it then if i say that a man’s soul which wher ever it is and whatever its quality is better than any body is beautifully ordered and that other beauties arise even from the penalties it xmdergoes for when it is unhappy it is not where it is fitting that only the happy should be but where it is fitting that the unhappy should be 78 henceforth let no one deceive us whatever is rightly to be blamed is spurned in comparison with what is better every existing thing however lowly is justly praised when it is compared with nothingness nothing is good if it can be better if we can be in good case having the truth itself our state is bad if we have only a trace of truth and much worse if the trace is extremely slight as when we adhere to fleshly pleasures let us conquer the blandishments and troubles of desire if we are men let us subdue this woman cupiditas with our guidance she will herself become better and be called no longer cupidity but temperance when she leads and we fol low she is called lust and we rashness and folly let us follow 266 augustine earlier writings christ our head that she whose head we are may follow us this precept can be laid upon women too not by marital but by fraternal right in christ there is neither male nor female women too have some virile quality whereby they can subdue feminine pleasures and serve christ and govern desire this is exemplified by many godly widows and virgins and in many too who are married but who by the dispensation of the chris tian people preserve conjugal rights in the bond of fraternity god bids us dominate desire and exhorts us and gives us the power to be restored to our own possession if therefore by negligence or impiety a man i.e mind and reason is subdued by desire he will be a base and unhappy man his destiny in this life and his ordained place hereafter will be where the most high ruler and lord will apportion him the universal creation may not be stained by any filthiness xlii 79 let us therefore walk while we have the day i.e while we can use reason let us turn to god so that we may deserve to be illumined by his word the true light and that darkness may not take possession of us day is the presence of the light that lighteth every man coming into the world john 1 9 every man says scripture meaning everyone who can use reason and who when he has fallen can earnestly seek to rise if fleshly pleasure is loved let it be carefully con sidered and vestigial traces of number will be recognized in it we must then seek the realm where number exists in complete tranquillity for there existence is above all unity and if number is found in living movement as for example in growing seeds it will be even more wonderful than when found in cor poreal things if in seeds number could change and swell as seeds themselves do half a tree would grow from half a fig seed whole and complete animals would not be produced except from complete animal seeds as they are in the case of the litters of certain animals and a single tiny seed would not have the power to multiply its own kind innumerably obviously from a single seed according to the nature of each crops can propa gate crops woods woods herds herds and peoples peoples throughout the ages so that there is not a single leaf or hair in all that rhythmic succession the reason for which did not exist in the first single seed again think of the rhythmic and pleasantly beautiful sounds transmitted by the air when the nightingale sings and yet the soul of that bird could not pro duce them so freely when it pleased unless it had them incor poreally impressed upon it by the life force this can be ob of true religion 267 served in other living creatures which lack reason but do not lack sense there is none of them which does not in the sound of its voice or in some other movement or activity of its members show something rhythmical and in its own fashion orderly not indeed by reason of any knowledge but by reason of the deep ties of nature which are arranged by the unchangeable law of numbers xliii 80 let us return to ourselves and pass over the things we have in common with trees and beasts the swallow builds its nest in one way and every kind of bird has its own way of building its nest what is it in us that enables us to judge all these the plan they are following and how far they accom plish it to judge ourselves too in our buildings and other activities of the body as if we were lords of all such things what gives us these innumerable thoughts what is it within us that knows that these corporeal things are relatively great or small that every body can be halved whatever size it may have and even then may be subdivided into innumerable parts if a grain of millet bears the same relation to one of its parts as our body bears to the world it is as great in respect of that part as the world is in respect of us and the world is full of designs and is beautiful not because of its size but because of the reason that is in it it seems great not because of its quantity but by comparison with our smallness and the smallness of the living things it contains these again can be infinitely divided and are small not in themselves but by comparison with other things and above all with the universe itself nor is it different with respect to lengths of time as in the case of space every length of time can be halved however brief it may be it has a begin ning a duration and an end so it must have a middle point being divided at the point where it draws nearer to the end the short syllable is short by comparison with a long syllable and the hour is short in winter when compared with a summer hour so the space of a single hour is short by comparison with a day so a day is short by comparison with a month a month with a year a year with a lustrum a lustrum with the larger circles of time and they with universal time the whole rhythmic succession and gradation in space and time is judged to be beautiful not by its size or length but by its ordered fitness 81 the mode of order lives in perpetual truth it has no bulk or temporal process by its potency it is greater than all space and by its eternity it remains changeless above the flux of time and yet without it vast bulk can have no unity and length of 268 augustine earlier writings time cannot be kept in the straight path there could be neither matter nor motion it is the principle of unity having neither size nor change whether finite or infinite it has not one quality here and another there or one now and another afterwards for it is supremely the unique father of truth and father of wis dom which is like the father in all respects hence it is called his similitude and image because it comes from him it is rightly called also the son and from him other things proceed but before him is the universal form perfectly identical with the unity from which it springs so that all other things so far as they have being and resemble unity are made according to that form xliv 82 some things are made conformable to that first form such as rational and intellectual creatures among whom man is rightly said to be made in the image and likeness of god not otherwise could he behold unchangeable truth with his mind but other things are made through the first form but are not in its image if the rational creature serve its creator by whom through whom and to whom it was made all other things will serve it life which is next in the scale below soul will lend aid in commanding the body and the soul will even rule over the body that last and lowest being for the body will yield to its will in all things and will give no trouble because the soul will not seek its happiness from the body or by it but will receive happiness by itself from god so the body too will be reformed and sanctified and the soul will rule it without loss or corruption and without any burden of difficulty tn the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but will be like the angels in heaven matt 22 30 meats for the belly and the belly for meats but god will destroy both it and them i cor 6 13 the kingdom of god is not eating and drinking but righteousness and peace and joy rom 14 17 xlv 83 wherefore even in bodily pleasure we find some thing to teach us to despise it not because the body is evil by nature but because it is shameful for a being who can cleave to higher things and enjoy them to be the sport of love of the lowest good when a charioteer loses control and pays the penalty for his rashness he accuses his equipment but let him implore aid let him take command of the situation let him control his steeds which are making a spectacle of his downfall and bid fair to bring about his death if no help supervenes let him get back into his place in the chariot and take control of the reins and tame his horses and rule them more cautiously of true religion 269 then he will realize how well the chariot had been made with all its equipment which by his ruinous handling brought danger upon himself and left the course of becoming moderation so in paradise the greediness of the soul which badly used its body produced weakness for it snatched at forbidden food against the prescription of the physician in following which salvation is to be found 84 if in the very weakness of visible flesh where no happy life can be some pointer towards happiness can be found be cause the form of it reaches from the top to the bottom of the scale of existence much more can a pointer be found in the search for rank and excellence even in the pride and vain pomp of this world for what else does a man seek in this case but to be if possible the sole lord of all things perversely imitating al mighty god if he submissively imitated him by living accord ing to his commandments god would put all other things under him and he would not reach such deformity as to fear a little animal even while he wants to rule over men pride in a manner seeks unity and omnipotence but in the realm of temporal things where all things are transient like a shadow 85 we want to be unconquered and rightly so for the nature of our mind is unconquerable though only as we are subject to god in whose image we are made but his commandments had to be observed and if they were obeyed no one would overcome us but now while the woman to whose words we basely con sented is subject to the pains of childbirth we labour on the ground and are disgracefully overcome by anything that can trouble or disturb us we do not want to be overcome by men but we cannot overcome anger what more execrable baseness can there be we admit that we are men and even a vicious man is better than vice how much more honourable it would be to be conquered by a man than by a vice who would doubt that envy is a monstrous vice which must necessarily torture and subdue anyone who is unwilling to be conquered in temporal things it is better that a man should overcome us than that we should be overcome by envy or any other vice xlvi 86 he who has overcome his vices cannot be over come by man either only he is overcome who has what he loves snatched from him by his adversary he who loves only what cannot be snatched from him is indubitably unconquer able and is tortured by no envy he loves what many have come to know and to love thereby deserving to be congratulated for he loves god with all his heart and with all his soul and with augustine earlier writings 270 all his mind and his neighbour as himself god does not grudge his becoming as he is himself rather he even helps him as much as possible he cannot lose his neighbour whom he loves as himself for he does not love even in himself the thinp that appear to the eyes or to any other bodily sense so he has inward fellowship with him whom he loves as hirnself 87 the rule of love is that one should wish his friend to have all the good things he wants to have himself and should not wish the evils to befall his friend which he wishes to avoid himself he shows this benevolence towards all men no evil must be done to any love of one’s neighbour worketh no evil rom 13 10 let us then love even our enemies as we are com manded if we wish to be truly unconquered for no man is unconquerable in himself but by the unchangeable law which makes free those who serve it and them only what they love cannot be taken from them and by that fact alone they are rendered unconquerable and perfect men if a man were to love another not as himself but as a beast of burden or as the baths or as a gaudy or garrulous bird that is for some temporal pleasure or advantage he hoped to derive he must serve not a man but what is much worse a foul and detestable vice in that he does not love the man as a man ought to be loved when that vice is dominant it leads to the lowest form of life or rather to death 88 man is not to be loved by man even as brothers after the flesh are loved or sons or wives or kinsfolk or relatives or fellow citizens for such love is temporal we should have no such connections as are contingent upon birth and death if our nature had remained in obedience to the commandments of god and in the likeness of his image it would not have been relegated to its present corrupt state accordingly the truth himself calls us back to our original and perfect state bids us resist carnal custom and teaches that no one is fit for the king dom of god unless he hates these carnal relationships let no one think that is inhuman it is more inhuman to love a man because he is your son and not because he is a man that is not to love that in him which belongs to god but to love that which belongs to yourself what marvel if he who loves his private advantage and not the commonweal does not obtain a king dom someone will say he should love both but god says he must love one most truly says the truth no man can serve two masters matt 6 24 no one can perfectly love that to which we are called unless he hate that from which we are called of true religion 271 we are called to perfect human nature as god made it before we sinned we are recalled from love of what we have deserved by sinning therefore we must hate that from which we choose to be set free 89 if we are ablaze with love for eternity we shall hate tem poral relationships let a man love his neighbour as himself no one is his own father or son or kinsman or anything of the kind but is simply a man whoever loves another as himself ought to love that in him which is his real self our real selves are not bodies so we are not to desire and set great store by a man’s body here too the precept is valid thou shalt not covet they neighbour’s property whoever then loves in his neighbour anything but his real self does not love him as him self human nature is to be loved whether it be perfect or in process of becoming perfect but without any condition of carnal relationship all are related who have one god for their father and who love him and do his will and all are fathers and sons to one another fathers when they take thought for others sons when they obey but above all they are brothers because one father by his testament calls them to one inheritance xlvii 90 why should not he be unconquered who in loving man loves nothing but the man the creature of god made according to his image and how can he fail to discover the perfect nature he loves since god is perfect for example if anyone loves a good singer not this or that particular one but any good singer being himself a perfect singer he wants all to be such while at the same time preserving his own power to do what he loves for he too sings well but if he is envious of any good singer he does not love good singing for itself but for the praise or some other advantage he wishes to obtain by singing well but that advantage can be diminished or indeed t en away if another sings well he who is envious of a good singer does not love him for his singing and on the other hand he who lacks talent does not sing well this could be much more fitly said of one who lives rightly because he can envy no one for the reward of right living is the same for all and it is not made less when many obtain it a time may come when a good singer cannot sing properly and requires another’s voice to show what he loves he might be at a banquet where it was wrong for him to sing but where he might properly hear another sing but it is never improper to live aright whoever does this and loves it not only does not envy those who imitate him but also treats them with the greatest possible kindness and good will but he augustine earlier writings 272 does not stand in any need of them what he loves in them he himself completely and perfectly possesses so when a man loves his neighbour as himself he is not envious of him any more than he is envious of himself he gives him such help as he can as if he were helping himself but he does not need him any more than he needs himself he needs god alone by cleaving to whom he is happy no one can take god from him he then is most truly and certainly an unconquered man who cleaves to god not indeed that he may merit any extra good thing from him but because for him to cleave to god is itself good 91 such a man so long as he is in this life uses lus friend to repay favours received his enemy to cultivate patience anyone at all in order to exercise beneficence and all men as objects of benevolence though he does not love temporal things he uses them rightly himself and takes thought for men according to the lot of each if he cannot treat them all alike so if he is more ready to speak to one of his friends than to anyone else it is not because he loves him more but because he has greater confidence in addressing him and opportunity opens the door he treats those who are devoted to temporal concerns all the better because he is himself less bound to temporal things if he cannot help all whom he loves equally without preferring to benefit those who are more closely related to him he is unjust relationship of mind is a greater thing than relationships due to the place or time where or when we were born in the flesh but the relationship which binds all together is the most im portant of all he is not made sorrowful by the death of anyone for he who loves god with all his mind knows that nothing can perish for him unless it perish also in the sight of god but god is lord of the living and the dead he is not made unhappy by the unhappiness of another any more than he is made just by the justice of another as no one can take from him god and justice so no one can take from him his happiness if at any time he is touched with feeling for another’s danger or error or grief he lets it go so far as to help or correct or console that other but not to subvert himself 92 in all laborious duties he cherishes the certain expecta tion of rest to come and so is not crushed what can harm him who can make a good use even of an enemy he does not fear enmities because he is guarded and protected by god who has given both the command and the ability to love enemies in tribulations he feels it is a small thing not to be saddened rather he even rejoices knowing that tribulation worketh patience of true religion 273 and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit which is given unto us rom 5 3 5 who can hurt such a man who can subdue him in prosperity he makes moral progress and in adversity leams to know the progress he has made when he has abundance of mutable goods he does not put his trust in them and when they are withdrawn he gets to know whether or not they had taken him captive usually when we have them we imagine that we do not love them but when they begin to leave us we discover what manner of men we are we have a thing without loving it when we can let it go without grieving he who by excelling obtains what he will grieve to lose seems to be ictorious but is in reality vanquished and he who by giving way obtains w hat he cannot unwillingly lose is really victorious though he seem to be vanquished xlviii 93 he who delights in liberty seeks to be free from the love of mutable things he who delights to rule should sub missively cleave to god the sole ruler of all things loving god more than himself this is perfect justice to love the better things more and the lesser things less he should love a wise and perfect soul because it has the quality of justice and a foolish soul because it has the power to become wise and perfect he ought not to love even himself if he is foolish for he who loves himself when he is foolish will make no progress towards wis dom no one will become what he desires to be unless he hates himself as he is but until he reaches wisdom and perfection he bears with the folly of his neighbour as he would bear with his own supposing he were foolish and at the same time a lover of wisdom wherefore if even pride itself is the shadow of true liberty and true royalty by it also divine providence reminds us what we are worth when we are stained with vice and to what we must return when we have been corrected xlix 94 all curiosity with regard to spectacles aims at nothing else than the joy of knowing things what then is more wonderful and beautiful than truth every spectator admits that he wants to reach truth hence he takes great care not to be deceived and vaunts himself if he shows more acuteness and vivacity than others in watching and learning and judging men carefully and closely watch a juggler who professes nothing but deceit if his tricks elude discovery they are delighted vrith the cleverness of the man who hoodwinks them if he did not know how to mislead those who were looking on or was believed a.e.w 18 274 augustine earlier writings not to know no one would applaud but any of the people who catches him out thinks himself worthy of greater praise than the juggler for no other reason than that he could not be deceived or taken in if many see through the trick the juggler is not praised but the rest who cannot see it are laughed at so the palm is always awarded to knowledge to the comprehension of truth but no one can reach truth who looks for it outside the mind 95 when we are asked which is better truth or falsehood we answer with one voice that truth is better and yet we are so sunk in trifles and baseness that we are much more ready to cling to jests and games in which deception not truth delights us than to the precepts of the truth itself so by our own judg ment and out of our own mouth we are sentenced because we approve one thing by reason and pursue another in our vanity so long as a thing is a matter of fun and games we know that it arouses laughter when it counterfeits truth but when we love such things we fall away from truth and cannot discover what they imitate and so we pant for them as if they were the prime objects of beauty getting further away from these primal ob jects we embrace our phantasms when we return to seek truth phantasms meet us in the way and will not allow us to pass on attacking us like brigands not indeed with violence but with dangerous pitfalls because we do not know how widely applic able is the saying keep yourselves from images i john 5 21 96 so some go vaguely wandering in thought through in numerable worlds others have thought that god cannot exist except as corporeal fire others have thought of god as the brightness of an immense light radiating through infinite space in all directions except that on one side it is cloven as by a black wedge they are of opinion that there are two realms one over against the other and they set up two opposing principles as fabulous as their phantasms if i were to urge them to declare on oath whether they know that these things are true probably they would not dare to go so far but they might reply tou show us what truth is if i were to reply simply that they should look for the light that enables them to be certain that believing is one thing and knowing another they themselves would swear that that light cannot be seen with the eyes nor thought of as filling any space however vast and yet that it is every where present to those who seek and that nothing can be found more certain or more serene 97 all that i have said about the light of the mind is made of true religion 75 clear by that same light by it i know that what i have said is true and that i know that i know it i know that that light has extension neither in space nor in time i know that i cannot know unless i am alive and i know more certainly that by knowing i attain a richer life eternal life surpasses temporal life in vivacity and only by knowing do i get a glimpse of what eternity is by looking at eternity with the mind’s eye i remove from it all changeableness and in eternity i see no temporal duration for periods of time are constituted by the movements past or future of things in eternity there is neither past nor future what is past has ceased to be and what is future has not yet begun to be eternity is ever the same it never was in the sense that it is not now and it never will be in the sense that it is not yet wherefore eternity alone could have said to the human mind i am what i am and of eternity alone could it be truly said he who is hath sent me ex 3 14 1 98 if we cannot yet cleave to eternity at least let us drive away our phantasms and cast out of our mental vision trifling and deceptive games let us use the steps which divine provi dence has deigned to make for us when we delighted over much in silly figments and grew vain in our thoughts and turned our whole life into vain dreams the ineffable mercy of god did not disdain to use rational angelic creatures to teach us by means of sounds and letters by fire and smoke and cloudy pillar as by visible words so with parables and similitudes in a fashion he played with us when we were children and sought to heal our inward eyes by smearing them with clay 99 let us then make clear to ourselves what faith we ought to repose in history and what in intelligence what we ought to commit to memory not knowing that it is true but believing all the same where is the truth that neither comes nor passes away but abides ever the same what is the mode of interpreting allegory believed to have been spoken in wisdom through the holy spirit whether it is enough to allegorize things that have been seen in ancient days and in more recent times or is it to be applied to the affections and nature of the soul and to un changeable eternity do some stories signify visible deeds others movements of minds and others the law of eternity or are some found in which all these are to be discovered what is stable faith historical and temporal or spiritual and eternal according to which all interpretation of authoritative writings is to be directed what advantage is to be derived from believing temporal things for knowing and possessing eternal things 276 augustine earlier writings which is the end of all good actions what is the difference be tween allegorizing history and allegorizing facts or speeches or sacraments how is the diction of the divine scriptures to be received according to the idiom of various languages every language has its own special modes of expression which seem absurd when translated into another language what is the advantage of such a lowly form of speech for in the sacred books we find mention made of the anger of god his sadness his awaking from sleep his remembering and forgetting and other things which can happen to good men not only so there is also mention of his repentance his zeal his feasting and other such things are god’s eyes and hands and feet and other mem bers named in scripture to be held to refer to something like the visible form of the human body or do they signify intel ligible and spiritual powers as do such words in scripture as helmet shield sword girdle and the like above all we must ask how it profits the human race that the divine providence has spoken to us by human rational and corporeal creatures who have been the servants of god when we have come to know that one truth all puerile impudence is driven from our minds and holy religion comes into its own li 100 putting aside therefore all theatrical and poetic trifling let us by the diligent study of the divine scriptures find food and drink for our minds for they are weary and parched with the hunger and thirst of vain curiosity and desire in vain to be refreshed and satisfied with silly phantasms as unreal as painted banquets let us be wholesomely educated by this truly liberal and noble game if wonderful and beautiful spectacles afford us delight let us desire to see wisdom vhich teaches from one end to the other with might and pleasantly disposes of all things what is more wonderful than incorporeal might making and ruling the corporeal world what more beautiful than its ordering and adorning the material world hi loi all admit that these things are perceived by the body and that the mind is better than the body will not the mind by itself have some object that it can perceive which must be far more excellent and far nobler we are put in mind by the things of which we are judges to look to that standard by which we judge we turn from artistic works to the law of the arts and we shall behold with the mind the form by comparison with which all the things are tarnished which its very goodness has made beautiful for the invisible things of god from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the of true religion 277 things that are made even his eternal power and godhead rom 1 2o this is the return from temporal to eternal things and the transformation of the old man into the new what can fail to urge man to strive for virtue when his very vices urge him curiosity seeks nothing but knowledge which cannot be certain knowledge unless it be knowledge of eternal things which remain ever the same pride seeks nothing but power which has reference to facility in acting but power is attained only by the perfect soul which is submissive to god and w hich with great love turns towards his kingdom bodily pleasure seeks nothing but rest and there is no rest save where there is no poverty and no corruption we must beware of the creatures of the lower regions i.e of severer penalties after this life where there can be no reminder of truth because there is no reasoning and there is no reasoning because there is no shining of the light that lighteth every man coming into this world john 1 9 wherefore let us hasten and walk while it is day lest darkness come upon us let us hasten to be set free from the second death where no one is who is mindful of god and where no one will make confession to god liii 102 but unhappy men make light of what they have come to know and rejoice in novelties they take greater pleasure in learning than in knowing though knowledge is the end of learning they hold facility in acting to be a poor thing and prefer the battle to the victory though victory is the end of battle those who care little for bodily health prefer to eat too much rather than to eat just enough for satiety they prefer to enjoy sexual acts rather than to suffer no such agitation some even prefer to sleep rather than not to be drowsy and yet the end of all these desires is mt to be hungry or thirsty not to seek intercourse with a woman not to be weary 103 those who desire these true ends first put off curiosity for they know that certain knowledge which is within and they enjoy it as far as they can in this life then they put off obstinacy and receive facility in acting knowing that it is a greater and easier victory not to resist the animosity of any one and they remain of this opinion so far as they can in this life lastly they seek bodily tranquillity by abstaining from things that are not necessary for living this life so they taste how sweet is the lord they have no doubt as to what will be after this life and their perfection is nourished by faith hope and charity after this life knowledge will be made perfect for now we know in part but when that which is perfect is come knowledge will not 278 augustine earlier writings be in part there will be perfect peace for there will be no other law in my members fighting against the law of my mind but the grace of god through jesus christ our lord will set us free from the body of this death to a eat extent we agree with the adversary while we are with him in the way the body will be entirely whole without lack or weariness for this corruptible will put on incorruption in its due time and order when the resurrection of the flesh comes there is no marvel if this is given to those who in knowing love truth alone and in action love peace alone and in the body love wholeness and nothing besides what they most love in this life will be made perfect for them after this life liv 104 to those who make a bad use of so good a thing as the mind desiring visible things outside the mind which ought to remind them to behold and love intelligible things to them will be given outer darkness the beginning of this darkness is fleshly knowledge and the weakness of the bodily senses those who delight in strife will be aliens from peace and involved in frightful difficulties the beginning of the greatest difficulty is war and contention and this i suppose is signified by the fact that their hands and feet are bound i.e all facility of working is taken from them those who want to hunger and thirst to burn with lust and be weary so that they may have pleasure in eating and drinking in lying with a woman and in sleeping love indigence which is the beginning of the greatest woes what they love will be made perfect for them for they will be where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth 105 there are many who love all these vices together their whole life is a round of seeing spectacles striving eating drink ing sleeping having sexual intercourse they have nothing in their thoughts but to embrace the phantasms which arise out of a life like that and from their deceptions to set up rules of super stition or impiety to deceive themselves to these they adhere even when they try to abstain from the enticements of the flesh they do not make a good use of the talent committed to them i.e keenness of mind in which all seem to excel who are called learned polished or elegant but keep it bound up in a napkin or buried in the earth i.e wrapt up in voluptuous and super fluous things and crushed beneath earthly cupidities therefore their hands and feet will be bound and they will be sent into outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth not because they loved these woes for who could love them but because the things they loved were the beginnings of true religion 279 of these woes and necessarily bring those who love them to this evil plight those who love the journey rather than the return home or the journey’s end are to be sent into distant parts they are flesh and spirit continually on the move and never reaching home io6 but he who makes a good use even of his five bodily senses to believe and praise the works of god to cultivate love of god to seek tranquillity of thought and action and to know god he enters into the joy of his lord the talent is taken from him who made a bad use of it and is given to him who made a good use of his five talents not indeed that keenness of intellect can be transferred from one to another what is meant is that clever people who neglect their minds and are impious can lose their gift and that diligent and pious people who are of a slower understanding can nevertheless reach understanding the talent was not given to him who had received two talents for he who lives aright both in thought and action already has all he needs it was given to him who had received five for he has not yet sufficient mental strength to contemplate eternal things who puts his trust in visible and temporal things but he can acquire it who praises god the maker of all sensible things who trusts god by faith waits on god in hope and seeks him in love iv 107 this being so my dearly beloved friends and brethren i exhort you as i exhort myself to run with all possible speed after that to which god calls us by his wisdom let us not love the world since all that is in the world is lust of the flesh lust of the eye and the pride of the world do not let us love to corrupt or be corrupted by fleshly pleasure lest we come to a yet more miserable corruption of grief and torment do not let us love strife lest we be given over to the power of the angels who rejoice in strife to be humbled bound and beaten let us not love spectacles lest we wander from the truth and love shadows and are cast into darkness 108 let not our religion consist in phantasms of our own imagining any kind of truth is better than any fiction we may choose to produce and yet we must not worship the soul though the soul remains true even when we entertain false imaginations about it stubble which is nevertheless real is better than light fabricated at will by the vain thought of him who imagines it and yet it would be madness to hold stubble which we can perceive and touch to be worthy of our worship let not our religion be the worship of human works the work men are better than their vorks yet we must not worship them 28o augustine earlier writings let not otir religion be the worship of beasts the worst men are better than beasts but we must not worship them let not our religion be the worship of dead men if they lived pious lives it must not be supposed that they seek divine honours they want us to worship him in whose light they rejoice to have us as sharers in their merit they are to be honoured by imitation and not adored with religious rites if they lived evil lives wherever they now are they are not to be worshipped let not our religion be the worship of demons for all super stition is the punishment and the deadly disgrace of men but it is the glory and triumph of demons 109 let not our religion be the worship of lands and waters air is purer and clearer than these though it can also be foggy we must not worship air let not our religion be the worship of the purer and more serene upper air for it is dark when there is no light purer than air is the brightness of fire which however we ought not to worship since we can kindle and extinguish it at will let not our religion be the worship of ethereal and celestial bodies for although they are rightly preferred to all other bodies still any kind of life is better than they if they are animated by a soul any soul in itself is better than any ani mated body and yet no one has ever thought that a vicious soul was to be worshipped let not our religion be the worship of the life that trees live for it is not sentient life it is of the kind that goes on in the rhythm of our bodies the sort of life that our bones and hair have and our hair can be cut without our feeling anything sentient life is better than this and yet we must not worship such life as beasts have 1 10 let not our religion be the worship of the perfectly wise rational soul as it is found in angels who steadfastly carry on their ministry in the universe or in its parts or in the best of men who await the reformation of their lower selves all rational life obeys the voice of unchangeable truth speaking silently within the soul if it does not so obey it is vicious rational life there fore does not owe its excellence to itself but to the truth which it willingly obeys the lowest man must worship the same god as is worshipped by the highest angel in fact it is by refusing to worship him that human nature has been brought low the source of wisdom and of truth is the same for angel and man namely the one unchangeable wisdom and truth the very virtue and changeless wisdom of god consubstantial and co eternal with the father for our salvation deigned in the tem poral dispensation to take upon himself our nature in order to of true religion 281 teach us that man must worship what every rational intellectual creature must also worship let us believe that the highest angels and most excellent ministers of god want us to join them in the worship of the one god in contemplation of whom they find their happiness even we are not made happy by seeing an angel but by seeing the truth by which we love the angels too and rejoice with them we do not grudge that they should have readier access to the truth and enjoy it without obstacle rather we love them because we are bidden by our common lord to hope for the same condition hereafter so we honour them with love but not with divine worship we do not build temples for them they do not wish to be honoured by us in that way because they know that when we are good men we are ourselves the temples of the most high god accordingly it is written with complete propriety that an angel once forbade a man to worship him bidding him worship the one god under whom both angel and man were fellow servants rev 19 10 iii those who invite us to serve and worship themselves as gods are like proud men who if they could would like to be worshipped in that way it is less perilous to endure such men than to worship demons all lordship of men over men is brought to an end by the death of the lord or of the servant servitude under the pride of the evil angels is more to be feared on account of the time that is to follow death anyone can easily see that under a human lord we are allowed to have our thoughts free we fear the lordship of demons because it is exercised over the mind in which is found our only means of beholding and grasping the truth wherefore though we be en chained and subjected to all the powers given to men to rule the state provided we render unto caesar the things that are caesar’s and to god the things that are god’s matt 22 21 there is no need to fear lest anyone should exact such service after we are dead the servitude of the soul is one thing the servitude of the body quite another just men who have all their joy in god alone congratulate those who praise him for their good deeds but when they are praised themselves where possible they correct the erring where that is not possible they are so far from being grateful for the error that they are eager to have it corrected the good angels and all the holy ministers of god are like these only more holy and pure we need not fear lest we offend any of them if we avoid superstition and with their help tend towards god alone and bind religare our souls augustine earlier writings 282 to him alone without superstition hence it is believed religion derives its name 1 12 one god alone i worship the sole principle of all things and his wisdom who makes every wise soul wise and his gift munus whereby all the blessed are blessed i am certainly sure that every angel that loves this god loves me too whoever abides in him and can hear human prayers hears me in him whoever has god as his chief good helps me in him and can not grudge my sharing in him let those who adore or flatter the parts of the world tell me this what good friend will the man lack who worships the one god whom all the good love in knowing whom they rejoice and by having recourse to whom as their first principle they derive their goodness every angel that loves his own aberrations and will not be subject to the truth but desires to find joy in his own advantage has fallen away from the common good of all and from true beatitude to such all evil men are given to be subdued and oppressed but no good man is given over into his power except to be tried and proved none can doubt that such an angel is not to be wor shipped for our misery is his joy and our return to god is his loss 1 13 let our religion bind us to the one omnipotent god because no creature comes between our minds and him whom we know to be the father and the truth i.e the inward light whereby we know him in him and with him we venerate the truth who is in all respects like him and who is the form of all things that have been made by the one and that endeavour after unity to spiritual minds it is clear that all things were made by this form which alone achieves what all things seek after but all things would not have been made by the father through the son nor would they be preserved within their bounds in safety unless god were supremely good he grudges nothing to any for he has given to all the possibility to be good and has given to all the power to abide in the good as far as they would or could wherefore it befits us to keep and to worship the gift donum of god equally unchangeable with the father and the son in a trinity of one substance we worship one god from whom through whom and in whom we have our being from whom we fell away being made unlike him by whom we have not been allowed to perish the principle to which we have recourse the form we imitate the grace whereby we are recon ciled we worship one god by whom we were made and his likeness by whom we are formed for unity and his peace whereby of true religion 263 we cleave to unity god who spoke and it was done and the word by whom all was made that has substance and nature and the gift of his benignity by whom nothing that he made through the word should perish but should please and be re conciled to its creator one god by whose creative work we live by whom we are remade so that we may live in wisdom and by loving and enjoying whom we live in blessedness one god from whom through whom and in whom are all things to him be glory for ever and ever amen the usefulness of belief st augustine s review of the utilitate credendij retractations f xiv i after i had become a presbyter at hippo regius i wrote a book entitled on the utility of believing addressed to a friend of mine who i knew had been deceived by the manichees and was still a victim of that error and mocked the discipline of the catholic faith because it bade men believe and did not teach them the truth by means of indubitable reason in that book hi 9 i said in these precepts and commandments of the law which christians may not now lawfully obey such as the sabbath circumcision sacrifice and the like there are con tained such mysteries that every pious man may understand that there is nothing more pernicious than to take them literally and nothing more wholesome than to let the truth be revealed by the spirit hence the letter kiileth but the spirit quickeneth i have expounded these words of the apostle paul di rently and as it seems to me or rather as it is apparent from the facts much more suitably in my book entitled on the spirit and the letter but the meaning i have given to them here need not be rejected 2 again i said xi 25 in religion two kinds of people are praiseworthy those who have already found the truth whom we must judge to be entirely blessed and those who seek it rightly and earnestly of these the former are already in posses sion the latter are on the way that leads most certainly to possession these words of mine are not erroneous if it be understood that those who have found the truth and whom i have described as being in possession are not entirely blessed in this life but in the life for which we hope and towards which we tend by the way of faith those are to be judged to have attained the final goal who have arrived where we desire to arrive with all our believing and seeking that is with our hold 284 the usefulness of belief 285 ing on the way of faith but i do not think it is true that they are or ever have been entirely blessed in this life not because in this life no truth at all can be discovered that can be perceived by the mind and not simply believed by faith but because however much of truth is discovered it is not sufficient to make men entirely blessed i would not say that the apostle's statement now we see through a glass darkly now i know in part is not perceived by the mind clearly it is but it does not make men entirely blessed perfect blessedness is described in these words but then face to face then i shall know even as i am known those who have discovered this must be said to have obtained possession of beatitude to which the way of faith we are following conducts us and which we desire to reach by believing but who the blessed are who are in posses sion of the blessedness to which the way of faith leads is a great problem unquestionably the holy angels have it but it may rightly be questioned whether holy men who have died may be said to have possession of it they have indeed put off the cor ruptible body which burdens the soul but they too still await the redemption of their bodies and their flesh rests in hope but does not yet shine with the incorruption that will one day be theirs but whether for this reason they have less power to con template the truth with the mind’s eye or face to face as it is said this is not the place to inquire or discuss in regard to what i said a little later in the same chapter to know important honourable and even divine things is most blessed this must also be held to refer to future beatitude for in this life know ledge however great does not mean perfect blessedness for that which is still unknown is incomparably greater 3 again in the same chapter i said there is a difference between true knowledge i.e rational knowledge and belief in what has been usefully handed down to posterity either by report or in writing our knowledge we owe to reason our beliefs to authority in popular speech that would seem to mean that we shrink from saying that we know what we believe on the testimony of suitable vdtnesses it should not be taken in this sense when we speak strictly we mean by knowings cer tain rational comprehension but when we are using words as they are used in ordinary parlance as divine scripture uses them we do not hesitate to say that we know what we perceive with the bodily senses or believe on the testimony of witnesses worthy of trust and at the same time we understand the differ ence between the two uses of the word knowing 286 augustine earlier writings 4 again the words in chapter xii no one doubts that men universally are either foolish or wise may seem to contradict what is written in de libero arbitrioy book iii as if human nature had no condition intermediate between folly and wis dom i was then inquiring whether the first man was created wise or foolish or neither we could not say that he was foolish when he was created without a fault for folly is a great fault and it was not quite clear how we could call him wise seeing he could be seduced and so i offered as a brief suggestion a condi tion intermediate between folly and wisdom i was also thinking of little children we may admit that they bring original sin with them but we cannot properly call them either wise or foolish seeing they do not as yet use free will either well or ill now in this passage i have said that all men are either wise or foolish meaning all men who have the use of reason whereby they are distinguished as men from the animals as in the sen tence all men wish to be happy we need not fear that little children will be understood as included for they cannot as yet will to be happy and yet the sentence is quite true obviously 5 in chapter xvi after relating what the lord jesus did when he was in the flesh i added why you ask do not such things happen now and my reply was because they would not affect us unless they were marvellous and they would not be marvellous if they were familiar in saying that i meant that such great miracles do not happen now not that no miracles happen even today 6 in chapter xviii at the end of the book i say that i have not begun to refute the manichees and to attack their absurdities nor to say anything important about the catholic faith i wanted simply if possible to rid you of a false opinion about true christians maliciously or ignorantly distilled into us and to stimulate you to learn certain great divine truths let this book be as it is if your mind is somewhat placated perhaps i shall be more ready to deal with other questions i did not mean that i had hitherto written nothing against the mani chees and nothing about catholic teaching for the books pre viously mentioned published by me testify that i had not kept silent on either subject but in this book i had not begun to refute the manichees or to attack their absurdities or to ex pound anything important about the catholic faith i hoped that with this as a beginning i should later be writing to honoratus himself what i had not yet written in this book the book begins si mihiy honor ate mum atque idem videretur esse the usefulness of belief introduction n othing it seems is known of honoratus to whom this tractate is addressed beyond what may be gleaned from the tractate itself it is true a certain honoratus of carthage sent a number of exegetical queries to st augustine who in 412 replied in a lengthy epistle epist 140 a veritable treatise in itself on the theme of the grace of the new testament there is nothing in the epistle to suggest that the two men are identical though they well may be it would be pleasant to think that st augustine won his case the honoratus of de util cred was a student friend of st augustine in his carthaginian days and shared in his early enthusiasm for philosophy unlike his friend he had not come from a christian home and he had a strong aversion to the manichees which was with difficulty overcome but as the result of st augustine’s persuasion he consented to become a hearer in that sect he was acute enough to observe that the manichees were more clever at refuting and deriding the tenets of others than at giving convincing proof of the truth of their own he also suspected the weakness of a position which while professing to accept the new testament documents too fre quently attempted to get rid of inconvenient passages by alleging that they had been interpolated nevertheless honor atus had retained his connection with the sect long after st augustine had abandoned it possibly because he had despaired of finding a satisfactory system to take its place catholic christianity in particular offended him because of its demand for belief upon authority this treatise written shortly after st augustine had become a presbyter in hippo in 391 may be said to show him at his 287 288 augustine earlier writings best in controversy unbending no doubt but also amiable and reasonable in his eagerness to win honoratus for the catholic faith he treats him with the utmost courtesy and respect he reasons with him as an old friend pointing out the way he had himself travelled through painful doubt to faith hoping that honoratus will be induced to follow it the brief account of his personal history sect 20 most interestingly confirms so far as it goes the account in the confessions here too are to be found his most cogent pleas for the authority of the catholic tradition because it is founded on historical events the life of christ and the new testament miracles and has obtained world wide acceptance and inspired the ascetic life in many it may well be believed and trusted as a starting point at least for those who seek true religion which is the highest wisdom important there fore if recondite even those who think they can achieve know ledge of truth and of god by reason alone cannot neglect this authoritative tradition the main subject of the treatise is the relation of faith and reason it is perhaps surprising that it should be entitled the utility and not the reasonableness of believing but this corre sponds to a central element of st augustine’s early thought knowing the result of rational demonstration is the highest achievement of mind but it is difficult except for the few who are wise later he came to hold that it was impossible so far as religion is concerned for any man in this life belief is a means to an end which is knowledge a necessary means for nearly all men and not to be despised even by the wise if only that the many who are foolish may not be discouraged what is true of the intellectual life is even more obvious of the prac tical life of duty even sceptics who teach that in the practical life probability is the rule thereby implicitly recognize belief as the bond of human society moreover historical events e.g the life and teaching of christ cannot strictly speaking be known but can only be believed on the ground of credible testimony here the argument is developed which was to be expressed later in extreme and epigrammatic form t should not believe the gospel unless the authority of the catholic church moved me to do so against the fundamental epistle of manichaeus 6 the usefulness of belief 289 analysis i i ii 4 introductory address to honoratus

religion and wisdom are identical 15 where opinions differ we must go to the most widely renowned teachers that we may err with the human race itself 16 the best teachers of rhetoric e.g are usually surrounded by a mass of pupils few of whom excel so also with religious teachers the multitude of their disciples should not repel us 18 the catholic faith by its weight of authority its world wide acceptance and general support is at least the obvious starting point 20 augustine’s intellectual pilgrimage from doubt to faith since he left africa ix 21 xiii 29 faith and reason 22 difference between belief and credulity 23 the religi ous inquirer demands that his sincerity be believed 24 not everyone can use reason in religion those fitted to do so should not grudge the easier way of believing to those less able 25 knowing believing and holding an uninstructed opinion only rational truth can be known events in the past cannot strictly be known but can be believed in prac tical life probability is the only guide and this implies some kind of faith 26 the stability of human society depends on believing 27 the foolish must believe and obey the wise especially in religion but 28 it is impossible for the foolish to decide who is wise 29 there will be no earnest search for religious truth unless men first believe th god exists and gives aid to seeking minds a.e.w 19 ago augustine earlier writings xiv 0 xvii 35 belief in christ r r fai all heretics who hold the christian name demand belief in christ on the ground of scripture such belief cp grounded on catholic tradition 32 christ himself de manded belief and performed miracles in order to win the belief of men who could not be won by reason 34 the authority of the catholic tradition is based on the miracles of christ in the past by which he gathered a multitude of believers also on the successful expansion of chnstianity and its continuance 35 the ascetic lives of many simple christians also supports its authority 1 xviii 36 final appeal to honoratus to abandon manichaeism the usefulness of belief the text to honoratus i i if i thought honoratus that there was no difference be tween a heretic and one who follows heretics i should judge that my tongue and my pen alike should remain quiescent in this matter but there is a great difference a heretic as i suppose is one who for some temporal advantage and chiefly for his own glory and pre eminence begets or follows new and false opinions he who trusts such men is deluded by some illusory appearance of truth or piety that being so i thought i ought not to keep silent from you what i think about the discovery and the retaining of truth for which as you know i burned with a great flame of love since my early youth truth is far removed from the minds of vain men who have gone too far among worldly concerns and falling think there is nothing beyond what they perceive by the senses these five well known mes sengers of the body even when they endeavour to withdraw from the senses they carry with them the impressions and images received from the senses and think that by their death dealing and fallacious rule the ineffable sanctuary of truth is to be rightly measured nothing is easier my dear friend than to say or even to think that one has discovered the truth how diffi cult it really is you will i trust recognize from this letter of mine that it may be a help or at least not a hindrance to you and to all into whose hands it may chance to fall i have prayed to god and do pray and i hope it may be so if i am right in feeling that i have taken up my pen with a pious and dutiful mind and with no desire for vain reputation or empty ostentation 2 my purpose therefore is to prove to you if i can that the 291 202 augustine earlier writings manichees rashly and sacrilegiously inveigh against those who accepting the authority of the catholic faith before they can behold the truth which only the pure heart can behold are forearmed by believing and are prepared for being enlightened by god you know honoratus that i fell among these people for no other reason than that they declared that they would put aside all overawing authority and by pure and simple reason would bring to god those who were willing to listen to them and so deliver them from all error what else compelled me for nearly nine years to spurn the religion implanted in me as a boy by my parents to follow these men and listen diligently to them than that they said we were overawed by superstition and were bidden to believe rather than to reason while they pressed no one to believe until the truth had been dis cussed and elucidated who would not be enticed by these promises especially if he were an adolescent with a mind eager for truth but made proud and garrulous by the disputes of learned men in school such they found me then scorning what i took to be old wives tales and desirous of swallowing and holding the open and sincere truth which they promised but again what reason kept me from wholly cleaving to them for i remained in the grade they call hearers so that i might not give up worldly hopes and duties the reason was that i ob served that they were more clever and ready of wit in refuting others than firm and sure in proving their own doctrines why do i speak of myself who was then a catholic christian and who have now nearly exhausted and parched after my long thirst sought again with all avidity the breasts which nourished me and weeping and deeply groaning have pressed them that there might come forth sufficient to refresh me in my present state and bring back hope of life and salvation why do i speak of myself you were not yet a christian when you were by my exhortation with difficulty induced to hear and find out about these men whom you violently detested what else delighted you i pray you to recall save their great presumption and the promise of a reasoned doctrine well they harangued at great length and with great vigour against the errors of simple people which i have since learned is extremely easy for anyone to do who is moderately educated and if they taught us any of their own doctrines we thought we must maintain it because nothing else occurred to us to set our minds at rest they dealt with us as tricky fowlers are wont to do who fix their limed twigs near water to deceive thirsty birds other water they cover and con the usefulness of belief 293 ceal or set up terrifying devices to scare the birds from them so that they may fall into their trap not by their own choice but by lack of any other supply 3 1 might of course answer myself by saying that these neat and clever similes and such censures generally can be most politely and eloquently used by any adversary against all who teach any doctrine whatever but i thought it right to put that sort of thing into my letter to warn them to cease to use similar modes of controversy as cicero says tet us give up trifling commonplaces and let us meet fact with fact case with case reason with reason let them cease to use the expression which trips from their mouths as by some necessity when some one has left them after long attending their discourses light has passed completely through him i do not bother so much about them but you who are my chief concern will observe how easy and vain is this method of censuring anyone i leave this point to your prudence i have no fear that you will think i was the dwelling place of light when i was involved in the life of this world nursing shadowy hopes of a beautiful wife of the pomp of riches of empty honours and other pernicious and deadly pleasures all these things as you know i did not cease to desire and hope for when i was their zealous hearer i do not attribute this to their teaching for i confess that they carefully warned me to beware of these things only to say that i have been abandoned by light when i have turned away from all these shadowy things and have decided to be content with such a livelihood as is necessary for bodily health but that i was bright and illumined when i loved these things and was held their prisoner is the mark of a man who to put it mildly has no very clear insight into matters about which he loves too much to prate but let us come to the controversy itself ii 4 you know well that the manichees by their censures of the catholic faith and chiefly by their destructive criticism of the old testament affect the unlearned who do not quite know how these things are to be understood and how being usefully taken they may go down into the veins and the marrow of souls still unweaned so to speak because some of these things offend ignorant and uncareful minds the great majority they can be popularly attacked not many have the power to defend them in an equally popular way because of the mysteries they contain the few who know how to do this do not love public controversy with its consequent publicity hence they are un known except to those who seek them out therefore concerning 294 augustine earlier writings the rashness of the manichees in censuring the old testament and the catholic faith listen i pray you to the considera tions which influence me i hope and pray that you will accept them in the spirit in which they are written god to whom the secrets of my conscience are known knows that in this little book i am doing nothing in malice but in the hope that my words may be acceptable in proof of the truth for a long time now and with incredible solicitude i have deter mined to live for the truth alone i trust that while it was very easy for me to err in your company to keep with you the straight path may not be to avoid a harsher expression very diisficult indeed in the hope which i cherish that you will find with me the path of wisdom i am sure he will not leave me to whom i have dedicated myself whom day and night i seek to behold and to whom i often pray even weeping because i know myself incapable of beholding him since the eye of my soul has been damaged by my sins and by my being habituated to the plagues of lethargic opinions as eyes which are scarcely opened after a long period of darkness and blindness turn away and refuse the light which nevertheless they desire especially if one try to point them to the sun so in my case i do not deny that there is an ineffable and unique spiritual good visible to the mind but i confess with weeping and groaning that i am not yet fitted to contemplate it nevertheless he will not leave me if i make no pretence if i follow the path of duty if i love truth and friendship if i am filled with anxiety lest you be deceived iii 5 the whole old testament scripture to those who diligently desire to know it is handed down with a four fold sense historical aetiological analogical allegorical don’t think me clumsy in using greek terms because in the first place these were the terms i was taught and i do not venture to pass on to you anything else than what i have received you will notice also that amongst us latins there are no words in com mon use to express these ideas if i were to attempt a translation of them i might be even clumsier if i were to use circumlocu tions i should be less speedy in my exposition this only i ask you to believe that however i stray i write nothing merely in the interests of a proudly inflated style in scripture according to the historical sense we are told what has been written or done sometimes the historical fact is simply that such and such a thing was written according to the aetiological sense we are told for what cause something has been done or said according to the analogical sense we are shown that the old and new the usefulness of belief 205 testaments do not conflict according to the allegorical sense we are taught that everything in scripture is not to be taken literally but must be understood figuratively 6 in all these senses our lord jesus christ and his apostles used scripture when it was objected that his disciples plucked ears of corn on the sabbath day his answer was taken from history have ye not read what david did when he was hungry and those who were with him how he entered the house of god and ate the shew bread which it was not lawful for him to eat or for those who were with him but only for the priests matt i2 3 4 to aetiology belongs the answer christ gave to his questioners who when he forbade divorce except for fornication told them that moses had allowed divorce if a bill of divorcement were given moses did this on account of the hardness of your hearts matt 19 8 here a reason was given why moses properly gave permission owing to the circumstances of the time while christ gave his commandment under dif ferent circumstances it would take a long time to explain the changes of the times and the order of change which is fixed and settled by a wondrous disposition of divine providence 7 then there is the analogical sense which shows the agree ment of the two testaments i need not say that this is used by all whose authority is accepted by the manichees it is their own affair to resolve the problem created by their wonted sug gestion that many things have been interpolated into the divine scriptures by i know not what corrupters of the truth that assertion always seemed to me even when i was their hearer utterly invalid and not to me only but to you for i well remember and to all of us who tried to exercise a little more care in judging than did the mass of their followers but now when many of the passages which troubled me most have been explained and straightened out those ones especially in dealing with which their oratory reached its climax giving itself a freer rein in the absence of any adversary none of their teachings seems to be more shameless or to use a milder expression weaker or less cautious than their assertion that the divine scriptures have been corrupted for they can produce no ex emplars still extant to prove it if they said that these writings were not to be accepted because written by men who in their judgment did not write the truth their cavilling would be more upright or their error more worthy of cultivated people this they have done with the book called the acts of the apostles when i consider their method i can hardly marvel at it enough 296 augustine earlier writings in a matter like this i do not need man’s wisdom but simply an ordinary heart obviously there is so much in that book which resembles the things they accept that it seems to me the greatest stupidity not to accept it too and to say that what offends them in it is false and interpolated or if that would be impudent as it is why do they attribute some value to the epistles of paul or to the four books of the gospel in which i suppose there is a far higher proportion than in the acts of passages which they make out to have been interpolated by corrupters now that is just the point which i ask you to consider with me judg ing quietly and calmly you know that they endeavour to in clude manes their founder among the apostles and say that the holy spirit whom the lord promised to send to his dis ciples came to us through manes accordingly if they accepted the acts of the apostles in which the advent of the holy spirit is clearly set forth they would not find any way of explaining how that passage had been interpolated their alleged cor rupters of the divine scriptures must have lived before the time of manes and must have belonged to those who wished to mix the jewish law with the gospel but they cannot attribute the passage about the holy spirit to such people unless possibly they allege that they prophesied and put into their book some thing that might later be urged against manes who said that the holy spirit was sent through himself i shall speak more plainly about the holy spirit elsewhere let me now return to my theme 8 i think i have shown sufficiently that old testament his tory aetiology and analogy are found in the new testament it remains to show the existence of allegory our saviour him self used an allegory from the old testament when he said this generation seeketh a sign but none shall be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonah for as jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth matt 12 39 40 what shall i say of the apostle paul who in the first epistle to the corinthians explains that the history of the exodus was an allegory of the christian people that was to be i would not have you ignorant brethren how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and all were baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual food and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ but with many of the usefulness of belief 297 them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples that we should not lust after evil things as they lusted neither be ye idolaters as some of them were as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play neither let us com mit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand men neither let us tempt christ as some of them tempted and were destroyed by serpents neither let us murmur as some of them murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happened unto them in a figure but they were written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the age are come i cor io:i ii there is another allegory also in the apostle’s writings which is very pertinent to the present issue inasmuch as the manichees themselves are wont to produce it and point to it to the galatians paul says for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bond maid the other by a freewoman but he who was born of the bond maid was born after the flesh but he of the freewoman was by promise which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which is hagar for sinai is a mountain in arabia and answereth to jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children but the jeru salem which is above is free which is the mother of us all gal 4 22 26 9 here these wicked men while they try to make the law of none effect at the same time compel us to approve of these scriptures they pay attention where it is said that those are in servitude who are under the law and above other passages brandish this decisive one you who are justified by the law are banished from christ you have fallen from grace gal 5 4 now we admit that all this is true we do not say the law is necessary save for those for whom servitude is profitable it was profitably laid down because men who could not be won from their sins by reason had to be coerced by threats and terrors of penalties which even fools can understand when the grace of christ sets men free from such threats and penalties it does not condemn the law but invites us now to submit to his love and not to be slaves to fear grace is a benefaction conferred by god which those do not understand who desire to continue under the bondage of the law paul rightly calls them un believers reproachfully who do not believe that they are now set free by our lord jesus from a servitude to which they had sgs augustine earlier writings been subjected by the just judgment of god hence this other saying of the same apostle the law was our pedagogue in christ gal 3 24 god thus gave men a pedagogue whom they might fear and later gave them a master whom they might love but in these precepts and mandates of the law which christians may not now lawfully obey such as the sabbath circumcision sacrifice and the like there are contained such mysteries that every pious man may understand there is nothing more pernicious than to take whatever is there literally and nothing more wholesome than to let the truth be revealed by the spirit for this reason the letter killeth but the spirit quickeneth ii cor 3 6 and again the same vail remains in the reading of the old testament and there is no revelation for in christ the vail is done away ii cor 3 14 it is not the old testament that is done away in christ but the concealing vail so that it may be understood through christ that is as it were laid bare which without christ is obscure and hidden the same apostle adds immediately when thou shalt turn to christ the vail will be taken away ii cor 3 16 he does not say the law or the old testament will be taken away it is not the case therefore that by the grace of the lord that which was covered has been abolished as useless rather the covering has been removed which concealed useful truth this is what happens to those who earnestly and piously not proudly and wickedly seek the sense of the scriptures to them is care fully demonstrated the order of events the reasons for deeds and words and the agreement of the old testament with the new so that not a point remains where there is not complete har mony and such secret truths are conveyed in figures that when they are brought to light by interpretation they compel those who wished to condemn rather than to learn to confess their discomfiture iv 10 meantime leaving aside all deep science let me treat you as i think i should treat my familiar friend that is accord ing to my own ability and not as learned men whom i have admired might do there are three kinds of error to which men are liable when they read first they may accept as true what is false and what the writer knew to be false secondly though this is not so obvious but no less deadly they may accept as true a false opinion actually held by the writer thirdly they may understand some truth from another’s writing which the writer himself did not understand in this kind of error there is no little advantage indeed if you consider it carefully you will the usefulness of belief 299 see that herein lies the whole benefit of reading an example of the first kind of error is this suppose someone were to believe that rhadamanthus in the underworld hears and judges the cases of the dead because he read it in vergil’s aeneid here is a double error he believes an incredible thing and the author himself is not to be credited with believing it here is an ex ample of the second kind of error suppose someone were to take it as true that the soul is composed of atoms and after death is dissolved into the same atoms and perishes because lucretius wrote it he is no less unhappy if in so great a matter he is per suaded to accept as certain what is false though indeed lucretius whose book has deceived him did hold that opinion what advantage is it to be certain about a writer’s opinion when one has chosen a companion in error and not a deliverer from error the third kind of error is complementary suppose someone were to read a passage in a book of epicurus in which continence was praised and were to assert that epicurus taught that virtue was the supreme good and consequently was not to be blamed the error of epicurus in believing that bodily pleasure was man’s supreme good does no harm to such a reader for he has not accepted so base and deadly an opinion indeed epicurus pleases him for no other reason than that he supposes that he epicurus did not hold an opinion that ought not to be held an error of this kind is not only entirely proper but is often very worthy in a good man suppose it were reported to me of one whom i loved that having reached adult life he declared to many listeners that he liked boyhood and infancy so much that he wanted to continue in that condition of life suppose the proof that he said so was so strong that i could not decently deny it would i seem blameworthy if i judged that when he said it he meant that what pleased him was innocence and a mind free from the cupidities in which the human race is involved and therefore loved him more than i had done before yes even if as a boy he had foolishly loved ignoble ease and too great liberty to play and eat suppose he died soon after this was reported to me and i had no opportunity to question him and discover what his opinion really was would anyone be so unjust as to be angry with me because i praised his intent and purpose on the basis of the words i had heard probably no just judge of such matters would hesitate to praise my high opinion of innocence and my good will in thinking well of a man though there was some doubt and i might have thought ill of him v 1 1 such being the case as regards readers let me tell you 300 augustine earlier writings that conversely there are necessarily the same number of diffi culties from the point of view of writers either one may write usefully and be misunderstood or both the writing and the understanding may be at fault or the reader derives an advan tage while the writer meant something quite different of these three possibilities i make no adverse comment on the first and the third does not concern me i cannot blame a writer who is misunderstood through no fault of his own nor am i troubled when i see that a writer who has not grasped the truth does not harm his readers but the best and most admirable situation is found only when good things are written and are properly understood by the readers even in this case because we have to do with two minds the possibility of error is not completely excluded for it often happens that the writer’s views are sound and the reader’s also but the latter holds them in a different sense sometimes a better sense sometimes an inferior sense but always profitably but when we share the views of our author and they are suited to promote good conduct the cause of truth is served in a high degree and no place is left open to falsehood now when we have to do with very obscure matters this kind of relationship between author and reader is extremely rare and in my opinion it is not a case where clear knowledge is possible but only faith how can i find out the intention and meaning of an author who is absent or dead in such a way that i could give evidence as to them on oath even if he were pre sent and could be interrogated even if he were not a bad man he could still conceal many things from a sense of duty but i do not think that the character of an author has much to do with the task of sifting truth it is most honourable to believe that an author was a good man whose writings were intended to benefit the human race and posterity 12 now let the manichees tell me how they would classify what they are pleased to call the error of the catholic church if in the first class the charge is grave but a long defence is not necessary it is sufficient to say that we do not so understand the old testament as they seem to imagine when they attack us if in the second class the charge is no less grave but the same answer refutes it if in the third class there is no indictment at all just consider the scriptures themselves what exactly do they object to in the books of the old testament are they good books but badly understood by us but the manichees refuse to accept them are they bad l 3 ooks and badly understood by us the previous reply is sufficient here too will they say that the usefulness of belief 3oi they are bad books though well understood by us but that is simply to absolve living adversaries with whom the case is being argued and to accuse men long since dead with whom there can be no argument for my part i believe that the authors of the old testament were great and divine men who to our profit handed down their writings and that the law was promulgated and codified at the command and by the will of god and i can easily prove it though i know very few books of this kind if a calm and not too obstinate mind will give me its attention i shall do so when you give me a kindly hearing but when shall i have such an opportunity is it not enough for me at present that you should not be deceived as to how the matter stands vi 13 i call my conscience to witness honoratus i call god who dwells in pure souls to witness that i am convinced there is nothing more wise more chaste more religious than those scriptures which the catholic church accepts under the name of the old testament you are amazed i am sure for i cannot pretend that i was not formerly of a very different opinion but there is nothing more rash and of rashness as a boy i had plenty than to desert the professed expositors of books which they possess and hand on to their disciples and instead to go asking the opinion of others who for no reason i can think of have declared most bitter war against the authors of these books who ever thought of having the obscure and recondite works of aristotle expounded to him by an enemy of aristotle i am speaking of studies in which the student may slip without committing sacrilege who ever wished to read or learn the geometrical treatises of archimedes with epicurus as his master who understanding nothing of them so far as i can judge nevertheless pertinaciously attacked them in his dis courses are the scriptures of the law which the manichees attack vainly and foolishly so very plain and open to vulgar understanding these men seem to me to resemble the woman whom they are wont to deride in her religious simplicity irritated because a manichaean woman praised the sun and commended it as an object of worship she leapt up in her excite ment and stamped on the place on the floor illumined by the rays that came in through the window exclaiming lo i tread under foot the sun your god utterly foolish and so like a woman no one denies it but don’t you think the manichees are just like that who with floods of oratory and malevolent criticism tear to pieces books which they do not understand of 302 augustine earlier writings which they do not know the purpose or the nature books which look quite simple but to those who understand are subtle and divine and because the ignorant applaud think they have achieved something wonderful all that is in these scriptures believe me is profound and divine all truth is there and learn ing suited to refresh and restore souls but in such a form that there is no one who may not draw thence all he needs provided he comes to draw in a spirit of piety and devotion such as true religion demands to prove that to you would require many reasons and a long discourse i must get you first not to hate these authors and then to love them and how else can this be done except by expounding their writings and their teachings if we hated vergil indeed if we did not love him before we knew anything about him because our seniors praised him we should never derive any satisfaction from the innumerable ver gilian questions that are wont to excite and agitate teachers of literature we should not be willing to listen to anyone who discussed these questions and praised the poet we should be favourably impressed by any one who tried to show that he was wrong or mad but now many teachers try to explain these questions variously according to the capacity of each and those obtain the greatest applause by whose exposition the poet ap pears in the best light so that even those who do not understand him at least believe that he was guilty of no error and that his poems are admirable in all respects so if in any question the teacher fails to give an answer we are angry with him and do not attribute his dullness to the fault of vergil if he tried to defend himself by blaming so famous an author he would soon be without pupils and fees surely we should show a similar respect to those through whom the holy spirit spoke as age long tradition has affirmed but we intelligent youths forsooth marvellous explorers of reason without turning over these books without seeking teachers without the slightest suspicion of our own slowness of comprehension without the slightest heed paid to those whose care it has been that these books should be read guarded and studied throughout the world and for so long a time we had the temerity to suppose that nothing such men said was to be believed influenced as we were by their bitter enemies among whom because of their false promise of reason we were compelled to believe and cherish an unheard of number of fables vii 14 now i shall if i may go on with my task and i shall endeavour not meantime to explain the catholic faith but to the usefulness of belief 303 urge those who care for their souls to examine its great mys teries and i shall show them that there is hope of divine fruit and of finding truth no one doubts that he who seeks true religion either believes already that the soul which is to profit by religion is immortal or at least hopes to gain that belief from religion itself all religion is on account of the soul no man has any care or anxiety about the condition of his natural body at any rate after death if his soul possesses that which will make it blessed on account of the soul alone or chiefly therefore true religion if there is one is instituted but the soul i know not why and i confess the problem is obscure the soul errs and is foolish as we see until it obtains and compre hends wisdom wisdom is perchance true religion am i sending you to fables am i compelling you to believe anything rashly i say our soul is ensnared and plunged in folly and error but seeks the path of truth if there be any if this is not your experi ence pardon me and share with me i pray your wisdom but if you recognize in your own heart that it is as i say let us i beseech you seek the truth together 15 suppose we have never heard any teacher of such a religion we are undertaking an entirely new enterprise we must first i suppose seek for men who profess to teach it sup pose we have discovered that some hold one opinion some an other and in the diversity of opinions all desire to attract inquirers each to his own opinion but suppose that among them there are some of notable celebrity accepted by nearly all nations whether in fact they possess the truth remains a big question but surely we must first find out about them so that so long as we err being human we may seem to err with the human race itself 16 but you say truth is found among the few if you know where it is to be found you are assuming that you know what it is but my hypothesis is that we are starting our search from scratch nevertheless granted that you are compelled by the force of truth to conjecture that only a few can possess it you do not know who in fact these are now suppose the few who know the truth are able to hold the multitude by their authority and can therefore expound and elucidate their secrets widely what then we see that very few attain consummate eloquence though throughout the whole world the schools of rhetoric thunder in the ears of crowds of young men surely those who wish to become good orators will not take alarm at the multi tude of the unlearned and imagine that they must pay attention 304 augustine earlier writings to the orations of caecilius and erucius rather than to those of cicero everyone wants to study cicero’s works because they are established by the authority of our ancestors the crowds of the unlearned endeavour to learn what is prescribed for their learning by a few learned men but very few succeed still fewer put their learning into practice and only a fraction attain to fame perhaps true religion is something like that no doubt the churches are frequented by multitudes of unlearned persons but that does not prove that among them there is none who is perfectly equipped in these mysterious truths if no more studied eloquence than the few who become eloquent our parents would never have sent us to the rhetoricians but if we were drawn to these studies by the very multitude of students most of them unlearned and sought to obtain what only a few can obtain why should we refuse to see something similar in the case of religion which we despise to the great danger per haps of our souls granted that the truest and most sincere worship of god is likely to be found among a few suppose these few have the assent of a multitude of people involved though they may be in cupidities and far from true understanding which undoubtedly can happen what answer i ask could we give to any one who censured our temerity and folly in not seek ing diligently from its proper teachers that which we were most eager to find the multitude scared me away what about the liberal arts which offer hardly any advantage even for the pre sent life what about the effort to acquire money or to obtain honour what about finding and maintaining good health finally what about the desire for happiness all men are con cerned about these matters while only a few excel but cer tainly no one is deterred from seeking these things because of the multitude of seekers 17 but it appears you say that ridiculous things are taught in the church who asserts it enemies forsooth i do not at present inquire why they are enemies or with what reason but enemies they are when i read a book i take in the knowledge all by myself do i indeed without some training in the poetic art you would not venture to touch terentianus maurus without a teacher you need asper cornutus donatus and innumerable others if you are to understand any poet whose poems and plays apparently win applause will you boldly venture without a teacher to study books which whatever they may be otherwise are at least holy and full of divine teachings and are widely famed with the assent of almost the whole human race will the usefulness of belief 305 you dare to pass sentence on them without a teacher if any thing occurs in them which seems to you absurd would you not accuse the slowness and worldly corruption of your own mind which is common to all fools before you bring an accusation against books which maybe cannot be understood by fools you would seek for someone both pious and learned or who was widely reputed to be such by whose precepts you might be made better and more learned by his teaching but such a man you say is not easy to find you would make elaborate in quiries there is none in the land you live in what better cause could there be to send you on a journey there is none or at least no signs of one on the mainland you would take ship if none were found in the nearest country across the sea you would proceed to the lands where the history recorded in these books is said to have been enacted we did nothing of the kind honoratus instead by our own arbitrary judgment we un happy youths condemned a religion which might have proved to be most holy and at any rate was still an open question a religion which has taken possession of the whole world what if those things in the scriptures which seem to offend some un skilled persons were put there on purpose so that when we read anything abhorrent to the feelings of ordinary folk not to men tion prudent and saintly folk we should the more earnestly look for a hidden meaning don’t you see how men try to put some fine interpretation on the beloved alexis in vergil’s bucolics for whom the harsh shepherd sang his song eclogue 2 and how they affirm that the boy about whom plato is said to have written an amatory poem has some deep significance which escapes the understanding of the unskilled so a richly endowed poet it appears may without sacrilege publish lustful songs 18 were we then prevented from inquiry into the catholic faith by some legal penalty by the power of adversaries by the worthless character or ill repute of its sacred officers by its recent foundation by the fact that it must be professed in secret there is nothing of that kind no law divine or human prohibits inquiry as to the catholic faith certainly human law allows it to be professed and cherished about divine law we are assuming that we are still uncertain no enemy terrifies us if we are weak but of course truth and the soul’s salvation ought to be sought at whatever risk even if they cannot safely be sought and found dignities and pow ers of all ranks serve this divine cult with the greatest devotion the name of religion is most honour able and in the highest repute what tlien hinders thorough a.e.w 20 3o6 augustine earlier writings discussion and pious and careful investigation of the question whether the catholic faith be not the religion which a few may know intimately and guard while it rejoices in the goodwill and favour of all nations 19 such being the case suppose as i said before we are now for the first time inquiring to what religion we are to entrust our souls for purification and restoration without any doubt we must first consider the catholic church christians are more numerous than jews and idolaters combined among christians there are several heresies but all want to be regarded as catholics and call others beyond their own group heretics but there is one church all will admit numerically larger taking the whole world into consideration and sounder in the truth than all others as those affirm who know it the question of truth does not however concern us just now it is enough for our inquiry that there is one catholic church to which different heresies give different names while they are called by names proper to each one which they dare not deny hence those who judge without fear or favour can discern to whom properly belongs the catholic name to which all lay claim but lest any think there is need of lengthy or superfluous discourse on this point i simply assert that there is one church in which even human laws are in a manner christian not that i wish to create any prejudice in my own favour here only i judge that here is a most suitable starting point for our inquiry there is no need to fear that the true worship of god having no strength of its own to rely on may seem to need the support of those whom it ought itself to support but surely it is an entirely happy situa tion if the truth can be found where there is complete security to seek and to possess it otherwise it must be approached and searched for elsewhere whatever be the danger viii 20 having established these premises which in my opinion are so just that i ought to win my case with you against any adversary i shall to the best of my ability relate to you the path i followed when i began to look for the true religion in the spirit in which as i have shown it ought to be looked for when i departed from you across the sea i was already in a state of serious doubt what was i to hold what was i to give up in deed my hesitation grew greater day by day from the time that i heard the famous faustus you remember his coming to ex plain all our difficulties was held out to us as a gift from heaven well i recognized that he was no better than the others of the sect except for a certain eloquence he had when i got settled the usefulness of belief 307 in italy i reasoned with myself and deliberated long not as to whether i should remain in that sect for i was already sorry that i had fallen into it but as to how truth was to be found no one knows better than you do how i sighed for love of truth often it seemed to me that truth could not be found and my thoughts like a great flood tended to carry me over to the opinion of the academics but often again as i reflected to the best of my ability how lively was the human mind how wise how penetrating i could not believe that the truth must ever elude its grasp possibly the manner of seeking truth might be concealed and would have to be accepted from some divine authority it remained to inquire what that authority might be since among so many dissentient voices each one professed to be able to hand it on to me an inextricable thicket confronted me most tiresome to be involved in and here without any rest my mind was agitated by the desire to find the truth i gave up my customary intercourse with those whom i intended to abandon and in such perils nothing remained except to pray with tears and lamentations that divine providence might bring me aid that i did unremittingly at this point certain disputations of the bishop of milan gave me some hope that i might find the answer to many old testament difficulties which because they were badly explained to us used to offend us i made up my mind to continue a catechumen in the church in which i had been brought up by my parents until either i discovered the truth i was seeking or was persuaded that nothing was to be got by seeking if there had been anyone who could have been my teacher he would at that time have found me a most ready and docile pupil if therefore your experience has been of this kind and you have been similarly anxious about your soul if now at last you see you have been sufficiently tossed about and wish to bring your toils to an end follow the way of the catholic discipline which has been derived from christ himself and has come down to us through the apostles and by us will be passed on to posterity ix 21 but that is ridiculous you say because that is what all the sects profess to hold and to teach i cannot deny that all the heretics do make this profession the difference is that they promise to give to those whom they attract a reason even for their most obscure doctrines this is the chief charge they bring against the catholic church that it bids those who come to it to believe while they themselves impose no yoke of belief but glory in opening the fount of knowledge well you say what 3o8 axjgustine earlier writings could possibly be said in greater praise of them ah but the situation is not quite like that they say this without having any ability to fulfil their promise but only to win popularity by prating of reason the human soul naturally is pleased with such promises it does not consider its own powers and state of health and asks for the food of sound men which should only be given to the strong thus it sucks in the poison of deceivers true religion cannot by any means be approached without the weighty command of authority things must first be believed of which a man may later achieve understanding if he conduct himself well and prove himself worthy 22 but you will probably ask to be given a plausible reason why in being taught you must begin with faith and not rather with reason that is easy provided you remain calm that we may conveniently proceed please answer my questions tell me first why you think belief ought not to be required because you say credulity the characteristic of credulous people seems to me to be a fault otherwise we should not be accustomed to use the word credulous as a reproach if the mistrustful man is at fault because he suspects everything he does not know how much worse is the credulous man for they differ in this that the former doubts too much when he hears of things he does not know while the latter does not doubt at all i accept provision ally this opinion and distinction but you know that the epithet curious also usually implies a reproach whereas to call a man studious is to praise him now what pray is the difference be tween these two qualities you will certainly reply that though both have to do with keen desire to know the curious man is one who asks about things which do not concern him and the studious man on the contrary about things which do concern him now a man is deeply concerned about his wife and chil dren and their well being but if anyone who was away from home went on asking all comers how his wife and children were and what they were doing he is certainly prompted by a great desire to know and yet we do not call him studious although he very much wants to know about things which concern him very closely clearly our definition of the studious man breaks down for while every studious man wants to know about things which concern him not every man who does so is to be called studious but only he who has a strong desire to know such things as contribute to the liberal nurture and equipment of his soul we might of course rightly say that he studied this or that mentioning whatever it was that specially interested him the usefulness of belief 309 we can say that he studies his family if he loves them so much but we should not think him worthy of the name studious without qualification nor would i call a man who was desirous of hearing how his family was keeping studious of hearing unless taking special pleasure in a good report he wanted to hear one repeatedly but i might say he studies to hear if he was satisfied to hear once go back now to the curious man and tell me whether you think any one is to be called curious who gladly hears a fable which will bring him no advantage inas much as it is about things that do not concern him but is satis fied to hear it occasionally and without undue eagerness at a banquet for example or in some circle or meeting i don’t sup pose so and yet he clearly cares for the story he gladly hears therefore the definition of the curious man must be amended in the same way as that of the studious man now see whether the definitions with which we began this discussion must not also be amended why should we consider a man to deserve to be called suspicious who suspects something sometime or to be called credulous who believes something sometime accord ingly just as there is a great difference between one who studies something and a genuinely studious man and again between one who cares for a thing and one who is curious about it so there is a great difference between a believer and a credulous person x 23 but now you will say let us see whether we ought to believe in the matter of religion for even if we admit that to believe is different from being credulous it does not follow that there is nothing wrong in believing in religious matters possibly believing and being credulous are two differing degrees of vice like being drunk on one occasion and being drunken habitually i do not see how anyone who accepts that as true can ever have a friend for if to believe anything is base either it is base to believe a friend or without such belief i cannot see how anyone can go on speaking about friendship here perhaps you will say i agree one must believe something sometimes but ex plain to me now how in religion it is not base to believe before one knows i shall do so if i can and so i ask you this question which do you think is more blameworthy to hand on religion to one who is unworthy or to believe what is said by those who hand it on if you do not know whom i mean by one who is unworthy i mean one who comes with a deceitful heart i dare say you agree that it is more blameworthy to unfold holy secrets to such a man than to believe what religious men affirm 310 augustine earlier writings concerning religion you could not decently make any other reply now suppose you are in the presence of a man who is going to hand on religion to you how are you going to assure him that you come in a true frame of mind that there is no guile or dissimulation in you so far as concerns the matter in hand you will say your conscience is clear that you are void of deceit you will assert this with all the words you are master of which are however only words for you cannot lay bare the lurking places of your mind that you may be intimately known as man to man but if he said i indeed believe you but would it not be equitable that you also believe me seeing that if i possess any truth you are going to receive a benefit and i am going to confer one what would you reply surely yes i ought to believe you 24 but you say would it not have been better to have given me a reason so that i might follow where he led without any rashness perhaps it would but it is a difficult matter for you to know god by reason do you think that all men are fitted to grasp the reasons by which the human mind is drawn to the knowledge of god or are a good many so fitted or only a few i think only a few you say do you believe you are of their number that is not for me to say you reply do you think then that your religious teacher ought to believe this of you suppose he does so then remember that he has twice believed you when you said things he could not be certain of but you were unwilling to believe him even once when he was speaking about religion granted then that you approach religion with a true mind and that you belong to the small number of those who are able to grasp the reasons by which divine power leads to certain knowledge do you think that religion is to be denied to other men who are not endowed with so clear a mind are they not to be brought to the inmost sanctuary gradually step by step you see what is obviously the more religious thing to do for you cannot think that any man who desires so great a possession ought to be abandoned or rejected but don’t you think that he will not attain real truth otherwise than by first believing that he will reach his goal then by presenting his mind as a suppliant finally by purifying his life by action in obedience to certain great and necessary precepts of course you do but what of those who can easily grasp divine secrets with certain reason i dare say you belong to that class is it any disadvantage to them to come by the way by which those come who start with believing i trow not and yet you ask the usefulness of belief 3ii why must there be delay because even if they do themselves no harm by by passing faith they harm others by their example hardly anyone thinks of himself as he ought he who thinks too little of himself must be stimulated he who thinks too much must be repressed so that the former may not be broken by despair and the latter fall headlong through over boldness the easy way to effect this is to compel those who are able to fly and who might be a dangerous incitement to others to walk as is safe for those others true religion provides for this very thing this has been divinely commanded and handed down by our blessed predecessors and preserved to our own day to want to disturb or pervert this practice is nothing but to seek a sacri legious way to true religion those who do so even if they are allowed to cannot reach their goal however they may excel in genius unless god be with them they merely crawl along the ground but god is only with those who seeking him have also a care for human society no surer step towards heaven can be found how can i say that nothing is to be believed when know ledge is impossible i cannot resist the argument that there can not be friendship of any kind unless something is believed which cannot be rationally proved a master is not blamed for trusting the slaves who serve him but in religion what can be more un fair than that god’s ministers should believe us when we profess to be sincere but that we should be unwilling to believe them when they instruct us finally what way can be more sound than first to become fit to receive the truth by believing the things which god has appointed for the preparation and cultiva tion of the soul or if you are already fitted to follow a some what round about but entirely safe path rather than to thrust yourself into danger so as to be an example of rashness to others xi 25 it remains for us to consider why we should not follow men who promise to guide us by reason we have already ex plained why it is not blameworthy to follow those who bid us believe but some think that it is not only not blameworthy but in fact praiseworthy to go to these self styled sponsors of reason it is not so in religion two kinds of people are praiseworthy those who have already found the truth whom we must judge to be entirely blessed and those who seek it rightly and earnestly of these the former are already in possession the latter are on the way that leads most certainly to possession 1 cf retract i xiv 2 augustine corrects this and says that such blessed ness of possession is not possible in this life 312 augustine earlier writings there are three other classes of men who are certainly to be disapproved and detested there is the opinionated kind they think they know what they do not know the second class is composed of those who realize that they do not know but do not seek in such a way that they may find in the third class are those who do not think they know and are unwilling to seek at all there are also in men three mental activities closely related but needing to be distinguished viz knowing believing and holding an opinion if these are considered in themselves the first is always faultless the second is sometimes so the third never to know important honourable even divine things is perfect blessedness to know superfluous things does no harm but perhaps in learning them we waste time that should be used for more necessary purposes there is no harm even in knowing harmful things but doing or suffering them is bad if a man knows how to kill his enemy without danger to himself the knowledge does not make him guilty as the desire to act on it would if that desire is lacking nothing could be more innocent believing is blameworthy if one believes anything unworthy of god or if one believes too readily in man in other matters if anyone believes anything knowing that he does not know it there is no fault committed i believe that most wicked con spirators were once put to death by the virtuous cicero not only do i not know that but i am quite certain that i cannot possibly know it to hold an opinion is disgraceful for two reasons in the first place he who is persuaded that he already knows cannot learn even if the thing in question is something that may be learned and in the second place temerity in itself is the mark of an ill disposed mind suppose someone thinks he knows the fact i have just mentioned about cicero nothing prevents him from learning it though it cannot be a matter of knowledge strictly speaking but if he does not know the differ ence between true knowledge i.e rational knowledge and belief in what has been profitably handed down to posterity either by report or in writing he certainly errs and there is no error without disgrace our knowledge therefore we owe to reason our beliefs to authority and our opinions to error knowledge always implies belief and so does opinion but belief does not always imply knowledge and opinion never does if we now apply these three modes of mental activity to the five classes of men just mentioned the two approved classes which we put first and the three faulty ones which we put next we find that the first class the blessed believe the very truth the usefulness of belief 313 the second the studious lovers of truth believe upon authority the first of the faulty classes i.e those who are of opinion that they know what they do not know exhibit faulty credulity the other two classes believe nothing both those who seek truth but despair of finding it and those who do not seek at all all this applies to matters pertaining to some branch of learning for in practical life i just cannot see how anyone can refuse to believe altogether those who say that in action they follow probability prefer to say that they can know nothing rather than that they believe nothing who can approve what he does not believe and what is the probable if it is not approved where fore there can be two classes of opponents of truth those who re ject knowledge only not faith and those who condemn both but whether this latter class can be found in actual life i do not know i have said all this that we may know that in believing what we do not yet understand we escape the charge of being rashly opinionated let those who say we are to believe nothing but what we know beware of that charge which is a disgraceful and unhappy one but if one diligently considers the difference between thinking one knows and believing upon authority what one knows one does not know one will avoid the charge of error and of boorish pride xii 26 now i ask if nothing which is not known is to be believed how will children serve their parents and love them with mutual dutifulness if they do not believe that they are their parents that cannot be known by reason who the father is is believed on the authority of the mother and as to the mother midwives nurses slaves have to be believed for the mother can deceive being herself deceived by having her son stolen and another put in his place but we believe and that without any hesitation what we confess we do not know other wise who does not see that dutifulness the most sacred bond of the human race might be violated by the most overbearing wickedness who would be so mad as to think him blameworthy who performed the duties due to those whom he believed to be his parents even if they were not his parents in reality who on the other hand would not think him worthy of banishment who did not love those who were probably his true parents on the ground that he feared he might love those who were not his parents i could bring many instances to show that nothing would remain stable in human society if we determined to believe nothing that we could not scientifically establish 27 again let me put this to you which i trust will even more 314 augustine earlier writings readily have your assent in matters of religion that is in the knowing and worshipping of god those people are not to be listened to who tell us not to believe promising to give us from the start a reasoned account no one doubts that men univer sally are either foolish or wise by wise i mean not prudent and clever men but those who have as far as is possible clear and strongly established knowledge of god and man and live and conduct themselves in a way that answers to that knowledge all others however skilled or ignorant however excellent or depraved their manner of life i put in the number of the foolish if this is so who with but moderate intelligence can fail to see that for the foolish it is more useful and helpful to obey the pre cepts of the wise than to live by their own whims every deed wrongly done is sin nothing can be rightly done unless it pro ceeds from right reason and right reason is precisely virtue who then can be virtuous unless he is endowed with the mind of a sage the sage alone does not sin the fool sins in all that he does except when he obeys a sage for then his actions pro ceed from right reason but he is not to be considered master of his actions so to speak seeing he is the instrument and tool as it were of the sage therefore if it is better for all men not to sin than to sin all foolish people would live better lives if they could be servants of wise men no one doubts that this would be advantageous in less important matters like trading agricul ture marrying begetting and educating children in short managing one’s worldly affairs how much more in religion for human affairs are more easily grasped than divine a irs and in holier and more excellent things where we owe greater reverence and obedience all the more wicked and perilous is the sin of disobedience you see then that if our heart is set on the good religious life there is nothing for us so long as we are foolish but to seek out wise men and to obey them so that we may not suffer the domination of the folly which is in us and may in time escape from it altogether xiii 28 here again arises a most difficult question how can fools find a wise man hardly anyone ventures to claim the title openly yet many do so indirectly yet such is their disagree ment concerning the very things knowledge of which constitutes wisdom that either none of them or at best only one of them can be truly wise but which it is i cannot see at all how the foolish man is to decide with any certainty nothing can be recognized by signs unless one knows the thing of which these are the signs and the fool does not know wisdom gold and the usefulness of belief 315 silver and other such things may be recognized at sight even if one does not possess them but wisdom cannot be seen by the mental eye of anyone who lacks it things with which we make contact by a bodily sense are presented to us from without and with the eye we can see what belongs to another even if we do not ourselves possess it or anything like it things intellectually perceived are within the mind and possession and seeing are identical the fool lacks wisdom therefore he does not know wisdom he cannot see it with his eyes he cannot see it and at the same time lack it and he cannot possess it and be at the same time a fool he does not know it and so long as that is so he cannot recognize it anywhere so long as he remains a fool no one can with absolute certainty discover a wise man by obeying whom he may be delivered from the evil of his folly 29 when religion is the object of our quest god alone can provide a solution for this great difficulty we ought not to be seeking true religion unless we believe that god is and that he brings help to human minds for what are we trying so hard to investigate what do we hope to obtain what do we desire to reach something that we do not believe exists or can possibly be ours nothing could be more perverse in that spirit you would not dare to ask a favour of me or at least it would be im pertinent to do so yet you come expecting to find religion when you think that god does not exist or if he does cares nothing for us what if religion be such that it cannot be found unless it be sought with the utmost care and assiduity what if the ex treme difficulty of finding it exercises the mind of the seeker to fit it to grasp what it does find what is more pleasant and familiar to the eyes than the light yet after long habituation to darkness they cannot endure it what is more suitable for a body exhausted by disease than food and drink yet we see that convalescents are restrained and prevented from venturing to indulge in a satiety for which only strong men are fit lest food may itself bring back the disease which caused food to be refused convalescents i say don’t we urge the sick to take some food assuredly they would not try so hard to obey us against their inclination did they not believe that so they would recover from their sickness when will you give yourself to diligent and laborious search or dare to impose on yourself such thought and care as the thing is worthy of unless you be lieve the thing you seek actually exists rightly therefore and in full accord with the majesty of the catholic discipline it is 3i6 augustine earlier writings insisted that those who come to religion must be asked to have faith before everything else xiv 30 what reason then pray will your heretic give me for of course we are speaking of those who desire to be styled christians why does he ask me to refrain from believing as if from some rash act he bids me believe nothing very well then suppose i do not believe there is such a thing as true religion among men i do not believe it exists therefore i do not seek for it and yet i suppose he wants to demonstrate it to some inquirer for it is written he that seeks shall find unless i had some belief i should not come to him who forbids me to believe can there be any greater absurdity than that he should be displeased by my simple faith supported by no knowledge when it was my simple faith that brought me to him 31 but all heretics exhort us to believe in christ could they be more inconsistent two points are to be pressed home here first i must ask them where is the promised reason where is the rebuke of rashness where the assured knowledge if it is dis graceful to believe without a reason why do you expect me and urge me to believe anything without reason given so that i may be the more easily led by your reason will your reason build some strong edifice on a foundation of temerity i am speaking like those who take offence at our believing for my part i judge that believing before reasoning if you are not able to follow reasoning and cultivating the mind by faith in order to be ready to receive the seeds of truth is not only most wholesome but is indeed the only way by which health can return to sick minds but these men impudently try to get us to believe in christ though they think believing is to be derided as utterly rash again in the second place i confess i have come to be lieve in christ and to hold that what he said is true though supported by no reason are you my fine heretic going to lead me on from this starting point but let me consider for a moment i myself did not see christ as it was his will to be seen by men for it is declared that he was seen by common eyes like mine from whom did i derive my faith in him so that i may come to you duly prepared by faith i see that i owe my faith to opinion and report widely spread and firmly established among the peoples and nations of the earth and that these peoples every where observe the mysteries of the catholic church why then should i not rather ask most diligently of them what christ taught seeing that i was brought by their authority to believe that what he taught was profitable will 2 indeed give the usefulness of belief 3 7 me a better exposition of his teaching though i might not have believed if you had urged me to believe that he once existed or still exists this i have come to believe on the ground of a report confirmed by its ubiquity by its antiquity and by the general consent of mankind but you are so few in numbers so confused in thought so recent in time that no one could imagine that you could offer anything worthy of being received as authoritative what utter absurdity believe those you say who have taught you that christ is to be believed and then learn from us what he taught why on earth should i supposing they failed me and could teach me no more i could be much more easily persuaded not to believe in christ than to learn anything about him from others than those by whom i had been taught to believe in him what amazing audacity or rather absurdity you believe in christ and i undertake to teach you what he taught but if i did not believe you could teach me nothing about him could you but you ought to believe on your commendation oh no we instruct by reasoning those who already believe in him why then should i believe in him because of firmly rooted report does this report reach us through you or through others through others so i am to believe them in order that you may teach me possibly i might did not my friends give me special warn ing to have no dealings with you at all for they say you have pernicious doctrines they lie you will reply but how am i to believe them about christ whom they have not seen and not believe them about you whom they could see but don’t want to believe the scriptures but if any new or unheard of writ ing is produced or commended by a handful of people without reasonable confirmation we believe not it but those who pro duce it wherefore if you being so few and unknown produce scriptures we are unwilling to believe and at the same time you are acting contrary to your promise in demanding faith rather than giving a reason you will appeal again to tradition and general consent at long last restrain your obstinacy and your wild lust to propagate your own sect and advise me rather to consult the leaders of the great mass of believers this i shall do most diligently and with the greatest possible efforts so as to learn something about these scriptures from men apart from whom i should not know there was anything to learn but do you go back to your lurking place arid lay no more snares in the name of truth which you are trying to take away from those whose authority you yourself admit augustine earlier writings 318 32 of course if such men deny that we are to believe in christ unless some indubitable reason is given they are not christians that is what some pagans urge against us foolishly but not inconsistently who could allow people to profess to belong to christ who maintain that nothing is to be believed unless fools are offered an absolutely clear and rational doctrine of god we see how christ himself according to the story which they also accept demanded faith above everything else and before everything else because those with whom he was dealing were not yet able to penetrate to the divine secrets what was the purpose of so many great miracles he said himself that they were done for no other purpose than that men should be lieve in him he led the foolish by faith you do it by reason he cried aloud that men should believe you declaim against faith he praised those who believed you rebuke them would he have turned water into wine to mention only one instance if men would have followed him if he had merely taught them and done no miracle is that word not to be taken into account ye believe in god believe also in me john 14 1 is the man to be blamed for rashness who would not have the lord come to his house believing that by his bare command his boy’s sickness would be cured christ therefore bringing a medicine to heal corrupt morals by his miracles gained authority by his author ity deserved faith by faith drew together a multitude thereby secured permanence of the tradition which in time cor roborated religion that religion neither the foolish novelty of heretics working deceitfully nor the ancient error of the nations in violent opposition will avail to pluck up and destroy in any part 33 wherefore though i have no ability to teach i do not cease to utter this warning many want to appear wise and it is not easy to discern whether they are not in reality fools pray to god with all intensity of mind with all your vows with groans and it may be with tears that he may deliver you from the evil of error if your heart is set on the happy life you will obtain your desire more easily if you willingly obey his precepts which are confirmed by the authority of the catholic church the wise man is so closely united with god in his mind that nothing can come between to separate them god is truth and no one is wise if he have not truth in his mind we cannot deny that man’s wisdom is a kind of intermediary placed between the folly of man and the pure truth of god the wise man so far as it is given to him imitates god the foolish man has nothing the usefulness of belief 319 nearer to him for wholesome imitation than the wise man but as has been said it is not easy by the use of reason to know who is wise miracles must be presented to the eyes of which fools are much readier to make use than of the mind so that under the constraint of authority men’s lives and morals may first be puri fied and they may thus become able to follow reason since then there had to be a human example to imitate and yet hope was not to be stayed on man what could better show the mercy and generosity of god than that the pure eternal and un changeable wisdom of god to whom we must cleave saw fit to assume human nature not only did he do miracles in order to incite us to follow god but he also suffered those things which deter us from following god no man can obtain the supreme and most certain good unless he fully and perfectly loves it and that he cannot do so long as he fears bodily evils and fortuitous circumstances by being born miraculously and by doing miracles he procured our love and by dying and rising again he drove away our fears in everything else he did which it would take too long to recall he showed himself such that we could perceive how far the divine clemency would go and to what heights human infirmity could be raised xvi 34 here is believe me most wholesome authority here is the preliminary raising of our minds above their earthly habitation here is conversion from love of this world to the true god it is authority alone which urges fools to hasten to wisdom so long as we cannot know pure truth it is misery no doubt to be deceived by authority but it is certainly greater misery not to be moved by it if the providence of god does not preside over human affairs there is no need to worry about religion but if all the best minds are urged to seek and to serve god openly as it were by the outward appearance of the universe which assuredly must be believed to emanate from some fountain of truest beauty and privately t5y some inward consciousness there is no need to give up the hope that god himself has constituted some authority relying on which as on a sure ladder we may rise to him putting aside reason which as we have often said is difficult for fools to follow in its purity this authority has two ways of appealing to us partly by miracles and partly by the multitude of those who accept it neither of these is necessary for the wise man no one denies that but the problem now is how we can become wise that is how we can cleave to the truth that assuredly the unclean mind cannot do uncleanness of the mind let me briefly ex 320 augustine earlier writings plain is love of anything besides god and the soul the more pure a man is from such uncleanness the more easily does he behold the truth to wish to see the truth in order that you may purge your soul is a perverse and preposterous idea because it is precisely in order that you may see that it has to be purged for the man who is not able to behold the truth in order that he may become able and allow himself to be purified authority is available making its appeal as i have just said and as no one doubts partly by miracles and partly by the multitudes of its adherents by miracle i mean something strange and difficult which exceeds the expectation and capacity of him who marvels at it among events of this kind there is nothing more suited to the populace and to foolish men generally than what appeals to the senses but again there are two kinds of miracle some there are which merely cause wonder others produce great gratitude and good will if one sees a man flying one merely marvels for such a thing brings no advantage to the spectator beyond the spectacle itself but if one is affected by some grave and desperate disease and at a word of command immediately gets better love of one’s healer will surpass wonder at one’s healing such things were done when god appeared to men as true man as far as was necessary the sick were healed lepers were cleansed to the lame the power to walk was restored to the blind sight to the deaf hearing the men of that time saw water turned into wine five thousand satisfied with five loaves of bread waters walked upon the dead raised of these miracles some looked to the body conferring on it an obvious benefit others looked to the mind conveying to it a hidden sig nal but all of them had regard to men bearing testimony to them of the majesty of christ so at that time divine authority drew the erring minds of mortal men towards itself but why you say do such things not happen now because they would not affect us unless they were marvellous and they would not be marvellous if they were familiar take the alternation of day and night the unvarying order of the heavenly bodies the annual return of the four seasons the leaves falling and return ing to the trees the endless vitality of seeds the beauty of light colour sounds odours the varieties of flavours if we could speak to someone who saw and sensed these things for the first time we should find that he was overwhelmed and dizzy at such miracles but we make light of all these things not because they are easy to understand for what is more obscure than their causes but because we are continually aware of them the usefulness of belief 32i christ’s miracles therefore were done at the most opportune moment so that a multitude of believers might be drawn to gether and that authority might be turned to profitable account in the interests of good morals xvii 35 morals of course have a certain value in gaining the minds of men but we find it easier to disapprove and detest wickedness usually the result of the prevalence of lusts than to abandon it or change it for the better do you think that too little regard has been paid to the human condition in that no earthy or fiery object in short no object accessible to the bodily senses is to be worshipped as god not a few learned men have maintained that god is to be approached through the intellect alone but unlearned folk too male and female in many diverse nations both believe and declare this think of abstinence limiting itself to the slenderest ration of bread and water think of fasts continued not for one day only but for several days to gether think of chastity caring not at all for marriage and off spring think of endurance that makes light of crosses and flames of liberality that distributes its patrimony to the poor of contempt of this world not stopping short of a longing for death what does all this mean few do these things still fewer do them rightly and wisely but the populace hear and approve favour and in the end love such men they blame their own weakness in not being able to perform such deeds wherein they show that they are not without some advancement of mind god ward some sparks of virtue all this has divine providence accomplished through the predictions of the prophets through the incarnation and teaching of christ through the journeys of the apostles through the reproaches crosses blood and deaths of the martyrs through the laudable lives of the saints and in every case through miracles worthy of such achievements and virtues and suitable to the various times when therefore we see such fhiit progressively realized by god’s aid shall we hesitate to place ourselves in the bosom of his church for it has reached the highest pinnacle of authority having brought about the conversion of the human race by the instrumentality of the apostolic see and the successions of bishops meantime heretics have barked around it in vain and have been con demned partly by the judgment of the common people partly by the weighty judgment of councils partly also by the majesty of miracles to be unwilling to give it the first place is assuredly the mark of consummate impiety or of heady arrogance if there is for souls no certain way to wisdom and salvation unless a.e.w a i 322 augustine earlier writings faith prepares them for the use of reason how is it possible to be more ungrateful for the help of god than to want to resist an authority so strongly established every kind of scholastic dis cipline however humble or easy to acquire demands a teacher or a master if it is to be acquired what is more rashly proud than to be unwilling to learn to understand the books of the divine oracles from their own interpreters and to be ready to condemn them without understanding them xviii 36 wherefore if my reasoning and my pleading affect you and you have as i trust a true care for your own good i hope you will listen to me and commit yourself in pious faith keen hope and simple charity to good teachers of catholic christianity that you will not cease to pray to god by whose goodness alone we were created by whose justice we pay the penalty for our sins by whose clemency we are delivered thus you will never lack the precepts and discourses of learned men who are truly christian nor books nor quiet thoughts en abling you easily to find what you are seeking abandon utterly those verbose and unhappy manichees what gentler adjectives could i use who search too much for the source of evil and never find anything but evil they often stir up their hearers to inquire into that problem but when they are eager they teach them things they ought not to hear it would be better to be continually asleep than to be awake in that manner into the lethargic they instil frenzy both of these diseases are deadly but they differ in that the lethargic die without troubling others while a frenzied person is dangerous to many sane people especially to those who wish to help him god is not the author of evil he never repented of anything he had made his mind is disturbed by no emotional storms no particular part of the earth is his kingdom he neither approves nor commands any crimes or evil deeds he never lies the manichees used to influence us by aggressively brandishing these truths and in sinuating that the contrary was old testament doctrine which is utterly false i grant they were right in attacking state ments which attribute evil to god but what have i discovered in attacking such statements they were not attacking catholic doctrine so i hold fast the truth i learned from them and i reject the false opinion they taught me but many other things the catholic church has taught me which these men of blood less bodies and crass minds cannot aspire to teach that god is not corporeal that no part of him can be perceived by the bodily eyes that none of his substance and nature is in any way the usefulness of belief 323 violable or mutable compounded or moulded to a pattern if you grant me all this and in no other way may we think of god all the devices of the manichees are brought to naught how it comes to be that god neither begat nor created evil that there is no nature or substance or ever has been or will be which god did not either beget or create and that he nonethe less delivers us from evil all this can be proved by reasons so compelling that it is impossible to doubt it especially for you and people like you if at any rate piety and peace of mind are added to a good disposition for without these spiritual quali ties nothing at all can be understood of these deep matters this is no story worthless as smoke no mere persian fable to which it is enough to lend an ear and a mind not subtle but quite puerile not as the manichees have it in their folly is the truth it is far far different but since my discourse has gone to much greater length than i expected let me put an end to this book you remember my purpose i have not yet begun to refute the manichees or to attack their absurdities nor have i expounded much of the catholic faith i wanted only if i could to rid you of a false opinion about true christians maliciously and ignorantly distilled into us and to stimulate you to learn certain great divine truths let this book then be as it is if your mind is somewhat placated perhaps i shall be more ready to deal with the other questions the mature of the good st augustine s review of de natura bonv retractations ii ix the book of the nature of the good is against the manichees there it is shown that god is unchangeable by nature and is the supreme good that other natures whether spiritual or cor poreal derive their existence from him and that so far as they are natures they are good also it is shown what evil is and whence it springs what great evils the manichees attribute to the good nature and what good things they attribute to the evil nature for their error has conjured up two opposing natures the book begins the supreme good beyond all others is god 3 4 the nature of the good introduction t he de matura boni written in 404 is the last of the anti manichaean writings coming soon after the massive contra faustum no special occasion for writ ing is mentioned and it seems strange that st augustine did not rather continue his refutation of the fundamental epistle of manes for which he tells us he had made some preparation the fragment which survives is in some respects more interesting than this work but it is already accessible in translation and the de natura boni has interesting features of its own it falls into three sections a i xxiii a summary but reasoned account of the augus tinian metaphysic god the supreme being and the supreme good from whom all other beings derive existence and value all being good by nature each in its degree evil is nothing but the corruption of natural good sin is voluntary and is exactly compensated by its penalty in a perfect world b xxiv xxxix proof of the doctrine point by point is adduced from scripture so that the less intelligent may believe on authority c xl xlviii an attempt is made to show that i the manichees are inconsistent attributing many good qualities to their evil nature and many bad qualities to their good nature 2 manichaeism leads to certain abominable practices at least so it is rumoured passages from the thesaurus and the fundamental epistle of manes are quoted to show that the suspicion is not without foundation in their authoritative writings 325 the mature of the good against the manichees the text i the supreme good beyond all others is god it is thereby unchangeable good truly eternal truly immortal all other good things derive their origin from him but are not part of him that which is part of him is as he is but the things he has created are not as he is hence if he alone is unchangeable all things that he created are changeable because he made them of nothing being omnipotent he is able to make out of nothing i.e out of what has no existence at all good things both great and small celestial and terrestrial spiritual and corporeal because he is just he did not make the things he made out of nothing to be equal to him whom he begat of himself there fore all good things throughout all the ranks of being whether great or small can derive their being only from god every natural being so far as it is such is good there can be no being which does not derive its existence from the most high and true god all are not supremely good but they approximate to the supreme good and even the very lowest goods which are far distant from the supreme good can only derive their existence from the supreme good every mutable spirit and every cor poreal thing that is the whole of created nature was made by god for everything that exists is either spirit or body god is immutable spirit mutable spirit is a created thing but it is better than corporeal things body is not spirit though in a different sense we speak of the wind as spirit because it is invisible to us and yet we feel its not inconsiderable force ii there are those who cannot understand that every natural being that is every spiritual and corporeal existent is good by nature they are impressed by the wickedness of spirits and the mortality of bodies and so they endeavour to 326 the nature of the good 327 maintain that there is another nature besides that which god has made viz that of malignant spirit and mortal body on their account we think that what we say can be brought to bear on their understanding in this way they admit that there can be no good thing save from the most high and true god now this is true and is sufficient to correct them if they will but pay attention iii we catholic christians worship god from whom are all good things great or small all measure great or small all form great or small all order great or small all things are good better in proportion as they are better measured formed and ordered less good where there is less of measure form and order these three things measure form and order not to men tion innumerable other things which demonstrably belong to them are as it were generic good things to be found in all that god has created whether spirit or body god transcends all measure form and order in his creatures not in spatial locality but by his unique and ineffable power from which come all measure form and order where these three things are present in a high degree there are great goods where they are present in a low degree there are small goods and where they are absent there is no goodness moreover where these three things are present in a high degree there are things great by nature where they are present in a low degree there are things small by nature where they are absent there is no natural thing at all therefore every natural existent is good iv if we ask whence comes evil we should first ask what evil is it is nothing but the corruption of natural measure form or order what is called an evil nature is a corrupt nature if it were not corrupt it would be good but even when it is cor rupted so far as it remains a natural thing it is good it is bad only so far as it is corrupted v of course it is possible that one nature even when cor rupted may still be better than another nature which has re mained uncorrupted because the one has a superior the other an inferior measure form and order according to the estima tion of men judging by what they see before them as they look corrupted gold is better than uncorrupted silver and corrupted silver is better than uncorrupted lead among spiritual natures of greater potency a rational spirit even when corrupted by an evil will is better than an irrational spirit that is uncorrupted and any spirit even when corrupted is better than any body even when uncorrupted for the thing which when present 328 augustine earlier writings gives life to a body is better than the body to which it gives life however corrupt the created spirit of life may become it can still give life to its body hence even when corrupted it is better than its body though the latter be uncorrupted vi if corruption take away from corruptible things all measure form and order nothing at all will remain in existence similarly any nature which cannot be corrupted will be the supreme good as god is any nature which can be corrupted has some good in it for corruption could not harm it except by taking away or diminishing what is good in it vii to his most excellent creatures that is to rational spirits god has given the power not to be corrupted if they do not will to be but remain obedient under the lord their god and cleave to his incorruptible beauty but if they will not re main obedient and are willingly corrupted by sin they are un willingly corrupted by penalties god is the good so that it can be well with no one who deserts him and among his creatures the rational nature is so great a good that no other good save god can make it happy sinners are ordained to punishment this order is contrary to their nature and is therefore penalty but it suits their fault and is therefore just viii other things created out of nothing which are inferior to rational spirit can be neither happy nor miserable since they are themselves good because of the degree of measure and form they possess and since though the good in them be small or even minimal they could not have existed save by the act of the good god most high they are so ordered that the weaker yield to the stronger and the feebler to those that have greater might and the less powerful to the more powerful so terrestrial things have peace with celestial things being as it were submissive to things which are more excellent than they are when things pass away and others succeed them there is a specific beauty in the temporal order so that those things which die or cease to be what they were do not defile or disturb the measure form or order of the created universe a well prepared speech is beautiful even though all its syllables and sounds pass in succession as if they are born and die ix the nature and quantity of the penalty due to each fault is determined by the judgment of god not by that of man when it is remitted to the converted that is proof of the great goodness of god when it is paid as due there is no inequity with god it is a better order that a thing riaturd should suffer punishment justly than that it should rejoice in sin with im the nature of the good 329 punity so long as it retains some measure form and order there is still some good in it no matter into what extremity it may come if these were all together taken away and destroyed completely there would be no good because there would be nothing left x corruptible natures would not be natures at all unless they derived being from god nor would they be corruptible if they were part of him they would then be as he is the fact that they have some measure form and order is due to their having been created by god and they are not immutable because they were made out of nothing it is sacrilegious audacity to equate nothing and god as we do if we want to make that which he created out of nothing equal to that which is born of god xi no hurt whatever can be done to the divine nature nor can any other nature which is less than divine be hurt unjustly no doubt some people by sinning do harm unjusdy their will to harm unjustly is counted against them but the power by which they are permitted to do the harm comes only from god who knows though they do not what those ought to suffer whom he permits them to harm xii if those who want to introduce a nature other than that which god has made would only pay attention to these clear and certain facts they would not be filled with such blasphemies as to impute so much good to the supreme evil and to impute to god so many evils as i said above it is sufficient for their correction if they would only pay attention to what truth compels them to confess even against their will that all good things come from god alone good things whether they are great or small all come from one source that is from the supreme good which is god xiii let us therefore recall all the good things we can which are worthy to be attributed to god as their author and let us see whether when they are removed anything will remain in existence all life potency health memory virtue intelli gence tranquillity plenty sense light sweetness measure beauty peace all these things whether great or small and other sirnilar things which may occur to one and especially those things which ai e found universally in spiritual or cor poreal existence measure form and order come from the lord god whoever willingly makes a bad use of these good things will by the divine judgment pay the penalty but wherever none of them is present at all absolutely nothing will remain in existence 330 augustine earlier writings xiv of these good things if any of them is present in a small degree it is given a bad name to distinguish that condition from conditions in which it is present in a higher degree for example because there is greater beauty in the form of a man by comparison with it the beauty of an ape is called deformity and this misleads the unknowing they think that the one is good and the other bad they do not notice that the body of the ape has its own proper measure correspondence of limbs on both sides concord of all its parts readiness in self defence and other qualities which it would take a long time to pursue xv that what we are saying may be understood and satisfy those whose intelligence is rather slow or even compel the pertinacious who resist the most patent truth to confess the truth let us ask whether corruption can harm the body of an ape if it can and the ape can become more hideous what is diminished if not such beauty as it has which is a good thing so long as its body continues to exist some beauty will remain so if the destruction of good implies the destruction of existence nature is good we say that the slow is the opposite of the swift but if anyone does not move at all he cannot be said to be slow we say that a low voice is the opposite of a shrill one or a harsh voice of a musical one but if you take away completely every kind of sound there is silence with no sound at all we are accus tomed to contrast silence with sound as contraries for the very reason that silence means the absence of sound we speak of clear and obscure as contraries but obscurity may have some light if it has none at all the darkness that results from the complete absence of light is like the silence which is the result of the complete absence of sound xvi qualitative deprivations are so ordered throughout the universe of nature that for those who consider them wisely their vicissitudes are not without propriety by not causing light to shine on certain places and during certain times god made darkness quite as appropriately as day if by keeping silent we interpose a suitable pause in our speech how much more does he the perfect artificer of all things suitably and appropriately cause these deprivations hence in the hymn of the three youths light and darkness alike praise god that is cause his praise to arise from the hearts of those who give full and right con sideration to them xvii no nature is evil so far as it is naturally existent nothing is evil in anything save a diminishing of good if the good is so far diminished as to be utterly consumed just as there the nature of the good 331 is no good left so there is no existence left not merely no such existence as the manichees introduce in which there is so much good that their blindness is wonderfully great but no such existence as anyone can imagine xviii not even matter which the ancients called hyle is to be called evil i do not mean what manes in his stupid vanity ignorantly calls hyle that is to say the power that forms bodies he is rightly said to be introducing a second god none but god can form and create bodies nor are bodies created without measure form and order being created with them now i imagine that even the manichees admit that these things are good and can only come from god by hyle i mean matter completely without form and quality out of which are formed the qualities we perceive as the ancients said hence wood is called hyle in greek because it is suitable material for workmen not that it makes anything but that something may be made out of it that hyle is not to be called evil it has no form by which we can perceive it indeed it can hardly be con ceived because it is so utterly without form but it has the capacity to receive form if it could not receive the form im posed on it by the artificer it could not be called material either now if form is a good thing so that those who have a superior form are called beautiful formosi doubtless even capacity for form is a good thing wisdom is a good thing and no one doubts that capacity for wisdom is also a good thing and because every good thing comes from god no one should doubt that matter if there is such a thing derives its existence from god alone xix gloriously and divinely our god said to his servant am who i am say to the children of israel he who is hath sent me unto you ex 3 14 he truly is because he is un changeable every change causes that which was to cease to be therefore he truly is who is unchangeable all other things which he made received existence from him each in its own degree to him who supremely is there can be no contrary ex cept that which is not consequently just as all that is good comes from him so from him comes all that has natural exis tence since all that has natural existence is good every nature is good and every good thing is from god therefore all nature is from god xx some think that pain whether in mind or body is the chief evil but there cannot be pain except in things naturally good for pain means that something that has been is in a sense 332 augustine earlier writings striving against extinction because what has been was good when it is being compelled to become better the pain serves a useful purpose otherwise it is useless mental pain is caused by the will’s resisting a greater power bodily pain is caused by the senses resisting a more powerful body but evils that have no accompanying pain are worse it is worse to rejoice in iniquity than to suffer in corruption there cannot be no rejoicing except by acquiring inferior good things iniquity is the abandonment of the better things in the body a wound that gives pain is better than a painless festering which is specifically called cor ruption the mortal flesh of our lord did not see i.e suffer corruption as was foretold in the prophecy thou wilt not give thy holy one to see corruption ps i6 io who denies that he was wounded by the driving in of the nails and pierced with the spear take festering which men call specifically a corruption of the body now if there is still something deep in the wound which it can consume the corruption grows as good is diminished but if there is nothing left to consume there will be no festering since there is no good left there will be nothing for corruption to corrupt and there will be no festering for there will be nothing to fester xxi tiny little things are in the common usage of speech said to be moderate because some measure remains in them without that they would not even be moderate but would not exist at all things which have gone too far are called im moderate and are blamed for being over large but even these must be kept within bounds under god who has disposed all things by measure number and weight xxii we may not say that god has measure in case that is taken to mean that he has an end yet is he not without measure by whom measure is given to all things so that they may in some measure exist on the other hand we must not say that god has measure as if it were imposed upon him from else where if we call him the supreme measure we perhaps say something significant at any rate if we understand the supreme good by what we call the supreme measure all measure so far as it is measure is good and we cannot speak of things as moderate modest or modified without implied praise of them in another sense we speak of measure as implying end and we say measureless meaning endless sometimes that too im plies praise as in the words of his kingdom there shall be no end luke 1 33 the writer might have said there shall be no measure modmy provided modus was understood to mean the nature of the good 333 end finis for of course he who reigns in no measure nullo modo in no way simply does not reign at all xxiii measure form and order are said to be bad when there is less of them than there ought to be or it may be be cause they are not suited to things as they ought to be or they may be called bad because they are alien and incongruous for example someone may be said to have acted in a bad manner modus because he did less than he ought or more than he ought or because he acted unsuitably or in a wrong way in the particular situation the action which is blamed as having been done in a bad manner is justly blamed for no other reason than that it did not preserve modus we speak of a form or appearance as being bad because it is inferior not in size but in comeliness when it is compared with more comely and beautiful forms the reason is that it does not suit the things which wear it and appears alien and unsuitable as for example if a man were to walk naked in the market place an action which would give no offence if it took place in the baths likewise order is said to be bad when too little order is observed it is not order but dis order that is bad where there is less order than there ought to be or where such order as there is is not as it ought to be nevertheless wherever there is some measure form and order there is some good and something naturally existing where there is no measure form or order there is neither good nor existence xxiv these things which we hold according to our faith and which reason also demonstrates can be fortified by testi monies from the divine scriptures so that the less intelligent who cannot follow the argument may believe on divine author ity and so may deserve to reach understanding those who understand and are less instructed in ecclesiastical sacred books are not to think that we have produced them out of our heads and that they are not in the scriptures that god is immutable is written thus in the psalms thou shalt change them and they shall be changed but thou art the same ps 102 26 27 and in the book of wisdom it is written of wisdom itself abiding in herself she reneweth all things wisdom 7 27 the apostle paul says to the invisible incorruptible only wise god i tim 1 17 the apostle james writes every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning james 1 17 because the son was not made but all things were made through him it augustine earlier writings 334 is written in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god he was in the beginning with god all things were made through him and without him nothing was made john i xxv we are not to listen to the nonsense of men who think that in this passage nothing must mean something they think that they can force us to this absurd and vain conclusion because the word nihil is put at the end of the sentence you see say they nothing was made and seeing it was made it is therefore something they have lost all sense in their eagerness to contradict they do not understand that there is no differ ence between saying without him was made nothing and saying without him nothing was made in either case they could equally well say that nothing is something because it was made take something that really exists what difference is there between saying without him there was made a house and saying without him a house was made the point is that something was made without him in this case a house so when it is said without him was made nothing nothing does not mean something when words are truly and properly used no matter where nothing is placed in the sentence it makes nothing of a difference who would be willing to hold conversa tion with men who when they hear the expression nothing of a difference can say therefore there is some difference because nothing is something those who have sound brains see quite clearly that my meaning is exactly the same whether i say nothing of a difference or a difference of nothing and yet these contentious people might say to somebody what have you done and if he replied that he had done nothing they might slander him saying you have done something because you have done nothing for nothing is something there is the lord himself putting that word at the end of a sentence where he says in secret have i said nothing john 18 20 let them read and hold their peace xxvi all things which god did not beget of himself but made through his word he made not out of things which al ready existed but out of what did not exist at all i.e out of nothing thus the apostle says who calleth those things which be not as though they were rom 4 17 but it is writ ten more clearly in the book of the maccabees i beseech thee my child lift thine eyes to the heaven and the earth and all that are therein see and know that the things were not of which the lord god made us ii maccabees 7 28 there is also what is the nature of the good 335 written in the psalms he spake and they were made ps 148 5 clearly he did not beget these things of himself but made them by his word and command what he did not beget he made of nothing for there was nothing else out of which he might have made them of him the apostle says most openly since of him and through him and in him are all things rom 11 36 xxvii of him does not have the same meaning as out of him de ipso what is de ipso may also be said to be ex ipso but not everything that is ex ipso can be correctly said to be de ipso of him are the heaven and the earth for he made them but they are not out of him because they are not parts of his substance if a man beget a son and make a house both are of him but the son is of his substance the house is of earth and wood this is because he is a man who cannot make anything of nothing but god of whom and through whom and in whom are all things had no need of any material which he had not made himself to help his omnipotence xxviii by these words of him and through him and in him are all things we must understand all natures that naturally exist for sins are not of him they do not observe nature but vitiate it in many ways holy scripture testifies that sins come from the will of the sinners especially in that passage where the apostle writes and thinkest thou this o man that judgest them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long sufifering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god who will render to every man according to his deeds rom 2 3 6 xxix though all things which god has made are in him those who sin do not defile him of his wisdom it is written she pervadeth all things by reason of her pureness and nothing defiled can find entrance into her wisdom 7 24 we must therefore believe god to be incapable of defilement as he is incapable of corruption and change xxx that god made also the lesser good things that is earthly and mortal things may without hesitation be under stood from that passage of the apostle where he speaks of our carnal members whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all the 336 augustine earlier writings members rejoice with it again god hath set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and again god hath tempered the body together ha dng given more abundant honour to that part which lacked that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for the other i cor 12 18 26 this measure form and order which the apostle praises in our carnal members can be found in the flesh of all animals both great and small for flesh of all kinds is ranked among earthly goods that is to say among the lowest good things xxxi the kind and magnitude of the penalty due to any particular sin is a matter for the judgment of god not man therefore it is written o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out rom 1 1 33 that sins are forgiven to those who are converted by the goodness of god is sufficiently proved by the fact that christ was sent who died on our behalf not in his divine nature but in our nature which he assumed of a woman the apostle thus preaches the goodness and love of god towards us god commendeth his own love towards us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us much more then being now justified by his blood shall we be saved from wrath through him for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to god through the death of his son much more being reconciled shall we be saved by his life rom 5 8 10 because there is no iniquity with god when sinners pay the due penalty he writes thus what shall we say is god unrighteous who visiteth with wrath rom 3 5 in one passage he briefly indicates that there are both goodness and severity in god behold then the goodness and severity of god toward them that fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness rom 1 1 22 xxxii that the power of those who do harm comes from god alone is thus stated in scripture it is wisdom that speaks by me kings reign and tyrants by me rule the earth prov 8 15 the apostle says there is no power but of god rom 13 1 that this is rightly so it is written in the book of job he makes the hypocrite king on account of the perversity of the people job 34 30 lxx of the people of israel god says i have given them a king in my wtath hos 13 11 for it is not unjust that the wicked should receive power to harm so that the patience of the good should be proved and the ini quity of the bad should be punished by the power given to the the nature of the good 337 dt nl job was proved that his justice might be made apparent peter was tempted so that he might not think too highly of him self paul was buffeted that he might not be puffed up and judas was condemned to hang himself god himself therefore did all things justly by the power he gave to the devil not for performing these just actions but for the wicked will to do hurt which came from the devil himself will he in the end be awarded punishment when it will be said to the impious accomplices who have persevered in his iniquity depart into the eternal fire which my father hath prepared for the devil and his angels matt 25 41 xxxiii because the bad angels were not made bad by god but became bad by sinning peter says this in his epistle god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down and com mitted them to pits of infernal darkness to be reserved for punishment in the judgment ii pet 2 4 peter thus shows that there is still due to them the penalty of the last judgment of which the lord says depart into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels of course they have even now received as a prison by way of penalty this infernal lower murky air in which we live it is indeed called heaven but it is not the heaven in which the stars exist but this lower region whose murk piles up in clouds and where birds fly it is also called the cloudy heaven and we speak of the birds of the heaven for this reason the apostle paul calls these same wicked angels against whose envy we fight when we live pious lives spiritual powers of wickedness in celestial places eph 6 12 and that this should not be understood to refer to the superior heavens he says clearly in another passage according to the prince of the power of the air who now worketh in the sons of disobedience eph 2 2 xxxiv because sin or iniquity is not a seeking of things evil by nature but an abandonment of the better things this is found written in scripture every creature of god is good i tim 4 4 every tree that god planted in paradise was good man therefore did not desire anything evil by nature when he touched the forbidden tree but by departing from what was better he himself committed an act that was evil the creator is better than any of his creatures and his command should not have been disobeyed by touching what was forbidden even though it was good the better was abandoned and a creaturely good sought which it was contrary to the command of the creator to touch god had not planted a bad tree in paradise a.e.w 22 338 augustine earlier writings but he who had forbidden that tree to be touched was better than the tree xxxv the reason for the prohibition was to show that the rational soul is not in its own power but ought to be subject to god and must guard the order of its salvation by obedience or by disobedience be corrupted hence god called the tree which he had forbidden to be touched the tree of the knowledge of good and evil because anyone who had touched it contrary to the prohibition would discover the penalty of sin and so would be able to distinguish between the good of obedience and the evil of disobedience xxxvi who could be so mad as to think that a creature of god especially one planted in paradise can be found fault with even the thorns and thistles which the earth produced according to the will of god in judgment in order to afflict the sinner by making him labour are not rightly to be found fault with even such herbs have measure form and order and any one who soberly considers them will find them worthy of praise but they are evil to the being who had to be disciplined in this way because of the fault of his sin as i said therefore sin is not a seeking of something evil by nature but an abandonment of what is better so the deed is the evil thing not the thing of which the sinner makes an evil use evil is making a bad use of a good thing hence the apostle reproaches some whom the divine judgment has condemned who worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator he does not find fault with the creature for whoever does that does injustice to the creator but he reproaches those who have abandoned the better thing and made a bad use of a good thing xxxvii if all natural things would preserve their proper measure form and order there would be no evil but if anyone willingly makes a bad use of these good things he cannot over come the will of god who knows how to subject even the unjust to a just order if they by the wickedness of their wills have made a bad use of his good things he by the justice of his power makes a good use of their evil deeds rightly ordaining them to punish ment who have perversely ordained themselves to sin xxxviii even the eternal fire which is to torment the im pious is not an evil thing it has its own measure form and order debased by no iniquity but torment is evil to the damned for whose sins it is the due reward nor is light an evil thing because it hurts the weak eyed xxxix the eternal fire is not eternal as god is for though the nature of the good 339 it is without end it is not without beginning god has no begin ning again though it is applied perpetually to the punishment of sinners it is nonetheless mutable by nature god alone has true eternity true immortality and absolute immutability for he cannot be changed at all it is one thing not to be changed when there is a possibility of change quite another when there is no such possibility a man is said to be good but not as god is of whom it is said none is good but god alone mark io:i8 the soul is said to be immortal but not as god is of whom it is said he alone hath immortality i tim 6 i6 a man is said to be wise but not as god is of whom it is said to the only wise god rom 1 6 27 so he fire is said to be eternal but not as god is whose immortality alone is true eternity xl since these things are so according to the catholic faith and sound doctrine and also according to truth as it is clear to those who have understanding none can harm the divine nature the divine nature can inflict harm on no one unjustly nor suffer anyone to do harm and to go unpunished he who doeth hurt says the apostle shall receive again for the hurt he hath done and there is no respect of persons with god col 3 25 xli if the manichees would think of these things in the fear of god and without the pernicious desire to defend their error they would not blaspheme most wickedly by introducing two natures one good which they call god and the other evil which god did not make so great is their error silliness and indeed madness that they cannot see what they are doing in effect they attribute to what they call the supreme evil by nature all these great good things life potency safety memory intelli gence moderation virtue plenty sensation light sweetness dimension numbers peace measure form and order and to the supreme good they attribute these great evils death sick ness forgetfulness madness perturbation impotence needi ness stupidity blindness pain iniquity dishonour war lack of moderation deformity perversity they tell us that the princes of darkness lived in their natural element and were safe in their kingdom and had both memory and intelligence at any rate they tell us that the prince of darkness made a speech such as he could not have made and such as his hearers could not have listened to unless they had memory and intelligence these powers of darkness we are told had suitably tempered minds and bodies and reigned in mighty potency they were plentifully supplied with all their elements and could perceive 340 augustine earlier writings themselves and the light which was their neighbour they had eyes wherewith to see it afar off now eyes without some light in them could not have seen light that is why eyes are rightly called luminaries they enjoyed their pleasures sweetly their limbs were well proportioned and their dwellings well planned at any rate unless there was some kind of beauty they would not have loved their marriages nor would their bodies have con sisted of parts that harmonized and without that the events recorded in the silly tale could not have taken place if they had no peace of any kind they would not have obeyed their prince if they had no measure they would do nothing but eat and drink and play the savage and act in other unsocial ways even so they would not have been determined by their particular forms unless they had some kind of measure as it is we are told that they performed such actions that there is no denying them fitting measure if there were no form there would be no natural quality if there were no order there would not be some ruling and others ruled they would not live harmoniously with their elements in short their limbs would not be arranged in their fitting places as is assumed by the vain manichee fable on the other hand on their vain showing the divine nature is dead and christ resuscitates it it is sick and he heals it it is forgetful and he brings it to remembrance it is foolish and he teaches it it is disturbed and he makes it whole again it is conquered and captive and he sets it free it is in poverty and need and he aids it it has lost feeling and he quickens it it is blinded and he illumines it it is in pain and he restores it it is iniquitous and by his precepts he corrects it it is dishonoured and he cleanses it it is at war and he promises it peace it is unbridled and he imposes the restraint of law it is deformed and he reforms it it is perverse and he puts it right all these things they tell us are done by christ not for something that was made by god and became distorted by sinning by its own free will but for the very nature and substance of god for something that is as god is xlii what can be compared to blasphemies such as these nothing at all if you consider the errors of other perverse sects nay if you compare the error we have been describing with another manichee error which we have not yet mentioned that sect will be proved to allege still worse and more execrable blasphemies against the divine nature they tell us that certain souls parts of the substance of god and sharers in the divine nature as they will have it went down not of their own accord but at the command of their father to fight against the race of the nature of the goob 34 darkness which the manichees call the evil nature that they were defeated and taken captive and were imprisoned for ever in a horrible sphere of darkness these souls of course did not sin voluntarily in this way according to their vain profane babbling god freed part of himself from a great evil but con demned anodier part of himself which he could not liberate from the enemy and yet celebrated a triumph as if the enemy had been defeated what wicked and incredible audacity to say or believe or proclaim such things about god when they try to defend this they fall with closed eyes into worse error for they say that mixing with the evil nature causes the good divine nature to undergo such evils by itself it cannot and could not have suffered the like as if an incorruptible nature is to be praised because it does itself no harm and not because nothing else can harm it now if natural darkness harmed the divine nature and the divine nature harmed natural darkness the fact that they did each other harm mutually means that there are two evils but the race of darkness was of a better mind for if it did harm it did it unwillingly it did not wish to harm the divine good but to enjoy it god wanted to blot out his enemy as manes vapours most openly in his deadly fundamental epistle forgetting what he had written a little earlier his glorious realms are founded upon a bright and blessed earth so that they can never be either moved or shaken by anyone he goes on to say the father of most blessed light knew that a great destruction and devastation arising from the realm of darkness was threatening his holy realms unless some excellent brilliant and mighty divine power should intervene to overcome and at the same time destroy the stock of darkness if that were blotted out perpetual rest would be achieved for the inhabitants of the realm of light you see he feared destruction and de vastation threatening his realms and yet they were founded upon a bright and blessed earth so that none could ever move or shake them because of this fear he determined to harm a neighbouring race and tried to destroy it and blot it out so that perpetual rest might be achieved for the inhabitants of the realm of light why did he not add and a petpetual prison were not those souls whom he imprisoned for ever in a sphere of darkness also inhabitants of the realm of light of them he openly says they endured exile from their former bright nature there he is forced against his will to say that they sinned by their free will though he will not allow sin to be ex plained except as due to necessity imposed by the contrary evil 342 augustine earlier writings nature he does not know what he is talking about and is as if he were himself shut up in his imaginary sphere of darkness seeking for a way out and not finding one i.et him say what he likes to the miserable followers whom he has seduced by whom he is much more highly honoured than christ is so that in return for this honour he sells them his long and profane fables let him say what he likes let him shut up the race of darkness in a sphere as in a prison and hem it in with light to which he promised perpetual rest when the enemy was blotted out the penalty suffered by light is worse than that suffered by darkness the penalty suffered by the divine nature is worse than that suffered by the hostile race no doubt the latter is all darkness within but then it was natural for it to inhabit darkness but the souls which are of the same nature as god will not be able he says to be taken back into the peaceful realms they will be exiled from the life and liberty of holy light and will be im prisoned in the aforesaid horrible sphere and so he says hhese souls will cleave to the things they have loved abandoned in the sphere of darkness procuring for themselves this fate by their deserts is not that freedom of the will with a vengeance you see how the raving man does not know what he is talking about by contradicting himself he wages a worse war against himself than against the god of the race of darkness itself moreover if souls that belong to light are condemned because they loved darkness the race of darkness is unjustly condemned for it loved the light the race of darkness loved the light from the begin ning it did not want to blot it out but to take possession of it albeit by violence the race of light determined to blot out the darkness by war but when defeated came to love darkness choose which you will either it was compelled by necessity to love darkness or it was voluntarily seduced if it was by neces sity why is it condemned if voluntarily why is the divine nature caught in such iniquity if the divine nature is compelled by necessity to love darkness it is vanquished not victorious if it loves darkness voluntarily why do these miserable people hesitate to attribute the will to sin to a being which god made out of nothing rather than to attribute it to the light which he begat xliii if moreover we show that even before its fabulous admixture with evil which they have imagined and foolishly believe there were great evils in the very nature of light as they call it how will it seem possible to add to their blasphemies before the battle against darkness took place there was for the the nature of the good 343 light the grim and inevitable necessity of fighting there is a great evil that existed before evil was mixed with good where did that come from seeing there was as yet no admixture if there was no necessity to fight but the will was there whence came that great evil that god was willing to harm liis own nature which could not have been harmed by the enemy by sending it to be cruelly embroiled shamefully tempted and un justly condemned how vast an evil is a will at once pernicious deadly and cruel before there was any admixture of evil from the hostile race did he perhaps not know that this would happen to his members that they would come to love darkness and be come enemies of the holy light as manes says that is enemies not only of their god but also of the father from whom they sprang whence came this great evil in god that he should be thus ignorant before there was any admixture of evil from the hostile race if he knew it would happen either there was eternal cruelty in him if he had no grief for the coming defile ment and damnation of his nature or eternal misery if he did grieve whence came this great evil in your supreme good before there was any admixture of your supreme evil if the particle of the divine nature which is held fast in the eternal prison of the afore mentioned sphere did not know that this fate was threatening it even so there was eternal ignorance in the divine nature if it did know there was eternal misery whence came that great evil before there was any admixture of evil from the hostile race perchance it was filled with such charity that it rejoiced because through its punishment perpetual rest was achieved for the other inhabitants of light let him anathema tize this suggestion who sees how impious it is to make it if the particle of the divine nature did indeed behave in this way and did not become hostile to the light perhaps it could be praised not as divine but as a man might be praised who was willing to suffer some evil for his country but that evil could only be for a time not for eternity but they say that the imprisonment in the sphere of darkness was eternal and that it was the divine nature that was so imprisoned nothing less it would surely be a most iniquitous execrable and unspeakably sacrilegious joy if the divine nature should rejoice in loving darkness and becoming the enemy of the holy light whence came this gross and wicked evil before there was any admixture of evil from the hostile race who could endure such perverse and impious folly as to attribute so much good to the supreme evil and so much evil to the supreme good which is god augustine earlier writings 344 xliv they say that this part of the divine nature permeates all things in heaven and earth and under the earth that it is found in all bodies dry and moist in all kinds of flesh and in all seeds of trees herbs men and animals but they do not say of it as we say of god that it is present untrammelled un polluted inviolate incorruptible administering and governing all things on the contrary they say that it is bound oppressed polluted but that it can be released and set free and cleansed not only by the courses of the sun and moon and powers of light but also by their elect to what sacrilegious and incredible shame this kind of nefarious error urges if it does not persuade them it is horrible to relate they say that the powers of light are transformed into beautiful males who are set before women of the race of darkness while others are transformed into beau tiful women who are set before males of the race of darkness by their beauty they inflame the unclean lust of the princes of darkness thus the vital substance i.e the divine nature which they say is held bound in their bodies escapes from their mem bers when they are relaxed in concupiscence and is thus re leased purged and set free this is what these unhappy folk read and say and hear and believe this is set down in the seventh book of their thesaurus the name they give to a certain writing of manes where these blasphemies are written then the blessed father who has shining ships as dwellings or lodging places in his clemency brings aid to set his vital substance free from the impious bonds and straits and torments in which it is held by his invisible nod he transforms his powers which he has in his shining ship and causes them to show themselves to the adverse powers which are set in the different parts of the heavens these are of both sexes male and female hence he makes the aforesaid powers appear partly in the shape of beard less boys to women of the adverse race partly in e shape of fair virgins to males of the opposite race he knows that all these hostile powers are easily taken in because of the deadly unclean lust that is congenital to them and will yield to the beautiful forms they see and will so be dissolved know that our blessed father is identical with these powen of his which for a necessary purpose he transforms into the undefiled likeness of boys and virgins he uses these as his proper instruments and by them accomplishes his will the shining ships are full of these divine powers which are set over against members of the infernal race as in a kind of marriage quickly aind easily in a moment they achieve their purpose when reason demands that they the nature of the good 345 should appear to males they show themselves in the form of beautiful virgins again when they have to come to women they put off the appearance of virgins and take on that of beardless boys at the comely sight ardour and concupiscence grow and the prison of evil thoughts is broken and the living soul which was held bound in their members is released and escapes and mingles with the purest air which is its native element souls that are completely purified board the shining ships which are prepared to carry them away and to transport them to their fatherland anyone who still shows the taint of the adverse race goes down step by step through fiery heat gets mixed up with trees and plants and the like and is stained with divers colours out of that great shining ship the figures of boys and virgins appear to the hostile powers whose home is in the heavens and whose nature is fiery at the fair sight the part of life which is held bound in their members is released and brought down by heat to earth in the same way the highest power that inhabits the ship of vital waters appears by means of his messengers in the shape of boys and holy virgins to the powers whose nature is cold and moist which also are set in the heavens to those which are female it appears in the form of boys and to males in the form of virgins by this diversity of divine and beautiful forms the princes of cold and moist stock whether male or female are brought to naught and the vital element in them escapes what remains is brought down to earth by cold and is mingled with all the species of earth who could bear stuff of this kind who could believe i do not say that it is true but that it could even be spoken fancy anyone afraid to anathe matize the teaching of manes and not afraid to believe that god could do or suffer anything like that xlv they tell us that the part of the divine nature that is mixed with evil is purged by their elect by eating and drinking forsooth for they say it is held bound in all foods and when these are consumed by the holy elect who eat and drink them for the refreshment of their bodies the divine nature is released sealed and set free the miserable people do not notice that it is vain for them to deny what is not surprisingly believed about them if they will not anathematize these books and cease to be manichees for if as they say there is a part of god bound in all seeds which is purged by the elect by eating them who would not in all good faith believe that they do what is done by the celestial powers arid the princes of darkness according to their thesaurus and especially as they say that their flesh belongs to 346 augustine earlier writings the race of darkness and do not hesitate to believe and affirm that the vital substance a part of god is held bound there too if it is to be released and purged by eating as their deadly error forces them to admit who does not see and abominate the awful and nefarious baseness that must ensue xlvi they say that adam the first man was created by certain of the princes of darkness so that the light might not escape from them in the epistle which they call fundamental manes has described how the prince of darkness whom they introduce as the father of the first man addressed the other princes of darkness his associates and how he acted with wicked fabrications he addressed those who were present saying what do you think about this great light that arises you see how it moves the heavens and shakes the greatest powers it is better therefore for you to give up to me the portion of light which you have in your power thus i shall make an image of the great one who has appeared gloriously so that we shall be able to reign free at last from our dark way of life hearing this they had long deliberation and thought it right to give what was demanded they did not think that otherwise they would be able to keep the light under their yoke so they thought it better to offer it to their prince in good hope that in this way they would continue to reign we must consider how they gave up the light they had the truth is scattered over all the divine scriptures and the celestial secret documents but it is not diffi cult to learn how it is given to the wise to know it it is known openly and face to face by whosoever will behold it truly and faithfully the multitude of those who had assembled was mixed including both males and females so he drove them to have intercourse their offspring resembled their parents obtaining all their great powers their prince rejoiced in these as an outstanding gift and consumed them as we see it hap pening even now the evil nature that forms bodies draws its power to make forms from this source so the aforesaid prince accepted the offspring of his companions with all the sense and prudence they derived from their parents together with the light that had been transmitted to them at birth and ate them up from that food he acquired many powers among which was not only fortitude but much more astuteness and bad feeling derived from the savage race of their parents then he called to himself his own wife who came of the same stock as he did and as the others had done he sowed the multitude of evils which he had devoured and added something of his own the nature of the good 347 thought and power so that his sense formed and marked out all that he poured forth his wife received this as well tilled earth is wont to receive seed for in her were constructed and knit together the images of all the celestial and terrestrial powers that what was formed should have the hkeness of the whole world xlvii o monstrous crime o execrable destruction and rottenness of souls deceived i will not say how horrible it is to say that the divine nature is thus bound let those who are grievously deceived and poisoned with this deadly error notice this they profess that part of god can be released and purged by eating but if it is bound by the intercourse of male and female by necessity this horrible error compels them to release it not only from bread vegetables and apples which are the only things they appear in public to accept but they must also release and purge the part of god by sexual intercourse if it has been conceived in the womb and can be bound there some are said to have confessed in a public tribunal that they have done this not only in paphlagonia but even in gaul as i heard from a catholic christian at rome when they are asked by what written authority they do these things i hear they produce the passage from the thesaurus which i quoted a moment ago when this charge is made against them they are accustomed to reply that one of their number that is one of the elect broke away and made a schism and founded this foul heresy so it is quite clear that though some of them may not behave in that way those who do get the idea from their books let them then throw away these books if they abhor the crime which they are urged to commit if they retain the books if they do not commit it they try to live cleanly contrary to the teaching of the books what do they do when we say to them either purge out the light from as many seeds as you can and don’t refuse to do what you assert you do not do or anathematize manes who says that in all seeds there is a part of god and that it is bound in sexual intercourse and that the portion of light i.e a part of god which comes as food for the elect is purged when they eat it you see what he is persuading you to do and yet you still hesitate to anathematize him what do they do i say when we say this to them to what subterfuges they resort either they must anathematize such nefarious doctrine or they must behave in such a wickedly shameful way that by comparison all the evils they attribute to the divine nature which i have just said were intolerable must seem tolerable i mean that it was 348 augustine earlier writings compelled to wage war that it was secure in eternal ignorance or troubled by eternal grief and fear when the corruption of ad mixture with evil came upon it and the prison of eternal damna tion that when the war had been waged it was taken captive oppressed and polluted and that after a false victory had been gained it was to live for ever fixed in a horrible sphere separated from its original felicity by comparison with the moral obli quities taught or practised by the manichees these doctrinal errors must seem tolerable even though considered in them selves they are not to be endured xlviii how great is thy patience o merciful and com passionate lord long suffering very pitiful and true who causest thy sun to rise upon the good and the evil and causest the rain to fall on the just and the unjust who desirest not the death of the sinner but rather that he be converted and live who chidest little by little and givest place for penitence so that men may give up their evil and believe in thee lord who by thy patience dost bring men to penitence though many according to their hard and impenitent heart heap up for them selves wrath in the day of wrath and of the revelation of thy just judgment when thou renderest to every man according to his works who forgettest all the iniquities of man in the day when he is converted from his wickedness to thy mercy and truth grant us the gift that by our ministry whereby thou hast willed that this execrable and utterly horrible error should be refuted others may be set free as many have already been may they deserve to receive remission of the sins and blasphemies wherewith in ignorance they have offended thee whether through the sacrament of thy baptism or through the sacrifice of a broken spirit and a contrite humbled heart in penitential sorrow such power has thy almighty mercy thy authority the truth of thy baptism and the keys of the kingdom of heaven given to thy holy church that there is no need to despair even of such men so long as by thy patience they dwell upon the earth especially those who know how evil it is to think or speak such things of thee and yet are kept in that malignant profession because of some temporal and earthly advantage which they are accustomed to enjoy or hope to obtain if only they will accept thy correction and fly for refuge to thy ineffable goodness and to all the enticements of the carnal life will prefer life celestial and eternal faith and the creed st augustine s review of faith and the creed retractations i xvii about the same time while still a presbyter i discoursed con cerning faith and the creed in the presence and at the bidding of the bishops who were holding a plenary council of the whole african church at hippo regius at the earnest request of several of them who were on specially friendly terms with me i wrote down my discourse in a book i spoke of the articles of the faith but not in the exact terms in which they are delivered to competents to be retained in the memory when i was dealing with the resurrection of the flesh in that book i said according to the christian faith which is infallible the body will rise again whoever thinks that incredible is paying attention to the flesh as it now is and does not consider it as it will be for in the time of angelic change there will be no more flesh and blood but body only that and all that i said about the transforma tion of terrestrial into celestial bodies i based on the apostle’s words flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of god but if anyone concludes from that that the earthly body we now have is changed into a celestial body by the resurrection in such a way that it will not have its members as at present and that there will be no fleshly substance without doubt he is to be corrected by the example of the lord’s body for not only was he visible with the same members after the resurrection but he could be touched and he verbally confirmed the fact that he had flesh saying handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye behold me having clearly the apostle did not mean to deny that there would be the substance of flesh in the kingdom of god but meant by the terms flesh and blood either men who live after the flesh or corrupt flesh of which of course there will be none then when he said that 349 350 augustine earlier writings flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of god he can perfectly well be understood as explaining what he immediately added neither shall corruption possess incorruption it is difficult to persuade unbelievers as to this but whoever will read the last book of the de civitate dei will find that i have dealt with it as carefully as i could faith and the creed introduction t he plenary council of the african church mentioned above was held at hippo in october 393 doubtless summoned and presided over by aurelius who in 390 had become bishop of carthage in 391 the new primate had written to st augustine then recently ordained and the latter’s reply is extant epist 22 from this we gather that the two men were already on the most friendly terms and were of one mind as to reforms necessary in the african church indeed it might appear that it was the presbyter who suggested to the primate the desirability of holding a reforming council if he did not specifically offer hippo as its venue he at least gave aurelius to understand that the bishop of hippo would willingly support him this correspondence shows that already st augustine’s importance was widely recognized and this would account for the remarkable fact that he a presbyter and a recent one at that was invited to address the bishops on so im portant a theme indeed the christians of hippo were already in fear lest some vacant church might call him away to be its bishop the discourse is a plain straightforward exposition of the creed article by article with a defence of its doctrine when called for against the philosophers the heretics sabellians arians apollinarians and manichees and the schismatics novatianists and donatists the tenets of these sects are briefly described and repelled but their names are not men tioned some of the articles of the creed are very briefly handled but some are dealt with at length and very interest ingly for example the omnipotence of god the father almighty 2 the divinity of the word 3 7 the temporal 352 augustine earlier writings dispensation for man's salvationj the incarnation and the virgin birth 8 12 the holy spirit and the trinity 16 20 the resurrection of the flesh 23 24 the opening chapter briefly explains the use of the creed and its relation to theology faith and the creed the text i i it is written and confirmed by the strong authority of apostolic teaching that the just shall live by faith and faith imposes on us a duty to be fulfilled both by the heart and by the tongue with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation rom io:io we must therefore be mindful both of righteousness and of salvation though we are to reign hereafter in eternal righteousness we cannot be saved from the present evil age un less earnestly seeking the salvation of our neighbours we profess with the mouth the faith which we hold in our heart we must see to it with careful and pious vigilance that that faith shall not be violated in any way for us by the fraudulent craft of the heretics but the catholic faith is made known to the faithful in the creed and is committed to memory in as short a form as so great a matter permits in this way for beginners and suck lings who have been reborn in christ but have not yet been strengthened by diligent and spiritual study and understanding of the divine scriptures there has been drawn up in few words a formula they must accept in faith setting forth what would have to be expounded in many words to those who are making progress and are raising themselves up to attain the divine doc trine in the assured strength of humility and charity under colour of the few words drawn up in the creed many heretics have endeavoured to conceal their poison but the divine mercy withstands and resists them by the instrumentality of spiritual men whose merit has permitted them not only to receive and believe the catholic faith as expressed in these words but also to know and understand it by revelation from god it is written except ye believe ye shall not understand isa 7 9 lxx a e.w 23 353 354 augustine earlier writings but the exposition of the faith serves to fortify the greed not that it is given to be committed to memory or repeated instead of the creed by those who obtain the grace of god but it guards the things contained in the creed against the wiles of heretics with full catholic authority and with a stronger defence ii 2 some have endeavoured to argue that god the father is not omnipotent not indeed that they have ventured to put it in that way but their teaching proves that this is their opinion and belief when they say that there is something which god omnipotent did not create but of which he made the world beautifully ordered as they admit they so far deny that god is omnipotent in that they believe he could not have made the world unless in making it he had used a material which already existed and which he had not made they base their argument on the ordinary carnal observation that smiths and builders and other workmen cannot put their art into effect without the aid of material already to hand so they understand that the maker of the world is not omnipotent if he could not have made the world without the aid of some kind of material which he had not himself made if they admit that the world was made by an omnipotent god they must admit that he made what he has made out of nothing if he were omnipotent there could be nothing of which he was not the creator even if he did make something out of something else as he made man out of clay he did not make it out of something which he had not himself made for he made the earth out of nothing and clay comes from the earth if he made the heaven and the earth i.e the world and all it contains out of some matter as it is written thou didst create the world out of invisible or even as some copies read formless matter wisdom 11 17 we must by no means believe that the matter out of which the world was made however formless or invisible could have existed as it was by itself as if it were co eternal and coeval with god only from god omnipotent did it receive whatever mode of being it had and whatever potentiality it had to receive other different forms for it is by his gift that any formed thing not only has its being but even is capable of receiving form there is this difference between what is formed and what is capable of receiving form that which is formed has already received form that which is tormable is capable of receiving form he who gives form to things also gives capacity for form for from him and in him is the unchangeable form which is the highest faith and the greed 355 form of all he is one who has given to everything not only its beauty but also its power to be beautiful most correctly there fore do we believe that god has made all things of nothing for if the world was made out of matter matter itself was made of nothing to be by god’s gift and appointment the primal tormable substance from which all that has form should be formed we have said this in order that no one should suppose that scripture contradicts itself when it says in one place that god made all things of nothing and in another that the world was made of formless matter 3 accordingly believing in god the father almighty we ought to believe that there is no creature which has not been created by his omnipotence moreover because he created all things through his word which is also called the power and wisdom of god and is hinted at by many other titles which commend the lord jesus christ to our faith as the son of god our saviour and ruler and because none could generate the word by whom all things are made save he who made all things through him hi we also believe in jesus christ our lord the only son of god only begotten of the father we must not think that the word is like our words which proceed from our mouths and are passed on by vibrations in the air and abide no longer than the sound of them remains that word abides unchangeable for of him scripture says speaking of wisdom remaining in herself she reneweth all things wisdom 7 27 he is called the word also because through him the father is made known for as by our words when we speak truly our mind lets him who hears them know something and by signs of that kind brings to the know ledge of another what we hold secretly in our heart so wisdom whom god the father begat is most appropriately called his word because through him the father who dwells in utmost secrecy becomes known to worthy minds 4 but there is a vast difference between our minds and the words with which we try to show what is in our minds we do not beget verbal sounds but make them and in making them we make use of the body as material now there is a great dif ference between mind and body when god begat the word the begetter was he who is he did not make the word out of nothing nor out of any ready made material but from his eternal nature this is what we too try to do when we speak the truth though not when we lie if we closely consider the purpose we have in mind in speaking what else are we trying to do but to bring our mind as far as it can be done into contact 356 augustine earlier writings with the mind of him who listens to us so that he may know and understand it we remain in ourselves and take no step outside ourselves but we produce a token whereby there may be knowledge of us in another so that if opportunity is afforded one mind as it were produces another mind to indi cate its meaning we do this with words and sounds and looks and bodily gestures so many devices that serve our purpose to make known what is within our minds but we cannot produce anything exactly like our minds and so the mind of the speaker cannot make itself known with complete inwardness hence also there is room for lying but god the father had the will and the power to make himself most truly known to those who were destined to know him and to make himself known he begat one who is like himself and who is called the power and wisdom of god because god operated through him and arranged all things wherefore it is written of wisdom that she heacheth from one end of the world to the other with full strength and ordereth all things graciously wisdom 8 1 iv 5 wherefore the only begotten son of god was not made by the father because as the evangelist says all things were made through him john 1 13 nor was he born of time for the eternally wise god has his wisdom with him eternally nor is he unlike the father i.e less in any way for the apostle says who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god phil 2 6 hence the catholic faith excludes those who say that the son is the same as the father i.e sabellians because the word could not be with god unless it were with god the father and he who is alone is equal to none likewise those are excluded who say that the son is a creature though not as the other creatures i.e the arians any creature however great if it be a creature is fashioned and made to fashion is the same as to create although in the usage of the latin language to create is sometimes used as a synonym for to beget the greeks however observe the distinction what we call a creature they call a kriayua or a krim if we wish to speak without ambiguity we must say not mare but condere therefore if the son is a creature however great he may be he is made we believe in him by whom all things were made not in him by whom other things were made and we cannot accept any other sense of the word all except as including whatever has been made 6 the word became flesh and dwelt among us john 1 14 the wisdom who was begotten of god deigned to be faith and the greed 357 created among men creari here it is pertinent to quote prov erbs 8 22 after lxx the lord created me in the beginning of his ways the beginning of his ways is the head of the church which is christ incarnate through whom there was to be given us an example of living i.e a certain way by which we might reach god we had fallen through pride for it was said to the first creature of our race taste and ye shall be as gods gen 3 5 we cannot return except through humility now our restorer deigned to show in his own person an example of this humility i.e of the way by which we must return for he thought it not robbery to be equal with god but emptied himself taking the form of a servant phil 2 6 so the word by which all things were made was created man in the beginning of his ways according to his nature as the only begotten he has no brothers but according to his nature as first born he has deigned to call brethren all who after him and by means of his headship are born again into the grace of god by adoption as sons as the apostolic teaching proclaims being son by nature he was born uniquely of the substance of the father being what the father is god of god light of light we are not light by nature but we are illumined by that light according as we are able to shine in wisdom he was the true light that lighteth every man coming into this world john 1 9 to the faith we profess with regard to eternal things we add the temporal dispensation of our lord which he deigned to carry through for us and to overrule for our salvation according to his nature as only begotten son of god it cannot be said of him that he was or that he will be but only that he is what was is not now and what will be is not yet but he is unchangeable without variation or temporal condition i think there is no other reason for the name by which he proclaimed himself to his servant moses for when he asked by whom he should say he had been sent if the people to whom he was sent should scorn him he received the answer i am who i am and it was added say to the children of israel hewho is hath sent me unto you ex 3 i4 7 from this i am sure it is manifest to spiritual minds that there can be no thing which is the opposite of god for if god is and this word sc i am can properly be said of god alone god has nothing opposite to him what is true abides unchange ably what changes once was and is not now or will be and is not yet if we were asked what is the opposite of white we should answer black if we were asked what is the opposite of hot we should reply cold if we were asked what is the opposite 358 augustine earlier writings of swift we should reply slow and so on but if the question is asked what is the opposite of that which is the correct answer is that which is not 8 but since by what i have called a temporal dispensation our mutable nature was assumed by the unchangeable wisdom of god for our salvation and restoration by the act of god’s loving kindness we also put faith in temporal things done on our behalf for our salvation for we believe in the son of god who was born by the holy spirit of the virgin mary by the gift of god that is by the holy spirit there was shown towards us such humility on the part of god most high that he deigned to take upon him the whole of human nature in the womb of a virgin inhabiting the body of his mother and being born of it while leaving it pure and entire the heretics have many insidious ways of attacking this temporal dispensation but anyone who holds the catholic faith and believes that the word assumed the whole of human nature body soul and spirit is sufficiently armed against them the incarnation took place for our salvation so we must take care not to suppose that any part of our nature was unassumed otherwise it will have no part in salvation apart from the shape of the limbs which differs in the different classes of living creatures man is not different from the cattle except in having a rational spirit which is also called a mind how could it be sane to believe that the divine wisdom assumed that part of our nature which we have in common with the cattle but did not assume the part which is illumined by the light of wisdom and is man’s characteristic part 9 those likewise are to be detested who deny that our lord jesus christ had mary as his mother on earth that dispensa tion did honour to both sexes male and female and showed that both had a part in god’s care not only that which he assumed but that also through which he assumed it being a man born of a woman we are not obliged to deny the mother of christ because he said woman what have i to do with thee mine hour is not yet come john 2 4 rather he lets us know that he had no mother so far as his divine nature is concerned and he was preparing to manifest his majestic character by turning water into wine when he was crucified he was crucified in his human character that was the hour which had not yet come when he spoke as he did meaning the hour when he would recognize her for in the hour when he was crucified he recog nized his mother’s human nature and commended her most i this refers to the heresy of apollinarius faith and the greed 359 considerately to his beloved disciple nor should we be moved by the other passage where when it was announced to him that his mother and brethren were present he replied who is my mother and who are my brethren matt 12 48 rather he would teach us that if our parents hinder the ministry which is ours to minister the word of god to the brethren we ought not to recognize them anyone who thinks that he had no mother on earth because he said who is my mother must also neces sarily think that the apostles had no fathers on earth because he bade them call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven matt 23 9 10 nor should our faith be lessened by any reference to a woman’s internal organs as if it might appear that we must reject any such generation of our lord because sordid people think that sordid the foolishness of god is wiser than men i cor 1 25 and to the pure all things are pure tit i i5 as the apostle truly says those who think in this way ought to observe that the rays of the sun which indeed they do not praise as a creature of god but adore as actually god are poured over evil smelling drains and other horrible things and do their natural work there without being made foul by any contamina tion though visible light is by nature more closely related to visible filth how much less could the word of god who is neither visible nor corporeal have been polluted by the body of a woman when he assumed human flesh along with a human soul and spirit within which the majesty of the word was hid den away from the weakness of the human body it is manifest that the word of god could never have been contaminated by the human body which does not even contaminate the human soul the soul is not soiled by contact with the body when it rules and animates the body but only when it lusts after the perishable goods of the body if these manichees would only avoid stains upon their souls they would rather fear such lies and sacrilegious doctrines v ii but our lord’s humility in being born on our behalf was only a small part in addition he deigned to die for mortals he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the gross phil 2 8 lest any of us even if he could shake off the fear of death should dread a kind of death which men think most shameful accordingly we believe in him who was crucified under pontius pilate and buried the name of the judge had to be added to mark the date and when we confess faith in his burial we remember the new tomb which 360 augustine earlier writings bears testimony to his resurrection to newness of life as the womb of the virgin did to his real birth for just as no other dead body was buried in that tomb before or after so no other mortal w as conceived in that womb before or after 12 also we believe that he rose again from the dead on the third day the first born of his brethren who were to follow him whom he called into the adoption of the sons of god and deigned to make his co heirs and co partners vi 13 we believe that he ascended into heaven the place of beatitude which he promised even to us saying they will be as the angels in heaven matt 22 30 in that city which is the mother of us all jerusalem eternal in the heavens it is wont to offend certain impious gentiles or heretics that we believe an earthly body was taken up into heaven the gentiles mostly ply us eagerly with the arguments of the philosophers who say that an earthly object cannot exist in heaven they do not know our scriptures or how it is written it is sown an animal body it is raised a spiritual body this does not mean that body is changed into spirit and becomes spirit the spiritual body is understood as a body so subject to spirit that it may be suited to its celestial habitation all earthly weakness and corruption being changed and converted into celestial purity and stability this is the change of which the apostle speaks when he says we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed i cor 15 51 that the change is not for the worse but for the better he teaches saying in the next verse we shall be changed it is the merest vain curiosity to ask where and in what manner the lord's body is in heaven it does not become our weakness to discuss the secrets of heaven but it is befitting our faith to think highly and honourably of the dignity of the lord's body vii 14 we likewise believe that he sitteth at the right hand of the father of course we are not to think that god the father is limited as it were by a human form in such a way that in think ing about him we should imagine a right side and a left side when it is said that the father sits we are not to think of him as doing so by bending his legs lest we fall into the sacrilege which the apostle execrates in those who have changed the glory of the incorruptible god into the likeness of corruptible man it is sinful to set up an image of god in a christian temple much more nefarious is it to do so in the heart which is truly the temple of god if it be cleansed from earthly cupidity and error we are to understand at the right hand of god to mean in supreme blessedness where righteousness is and peace and joy faith and the creed 361 just as the goats are placed on the left hand matt 25 35 5 i.e in misery on account of their iniquities toils and torments to say that god sits signifies not the position of his members but his judicial power which his divine majesty never lacks but which ever metes out to men their deserts but at the last judg ment the brightness of the only begotten son of god judge of the living and of the dead will be much more manifest among men so that none shall doubt it for ever viii 15 we also believe that at the right time thence he will come to judge the quick and the dead possibly these names signify the righteous and the sinners or it may be that those are called quick whom he will then find alive upon the earth while the dead are those who will be raised at his coming in any case the temporal dispensation is not like his divine generation for it has both a past and a future our lord was on the earth is now in heaven and will come in shining raiment to judge the quick and the dead he will come as he ascended according to the authority of scripture in the acts of the apostles and of this temporal dispensation it is written in the apocalypse thus saith he who is and who was and who is to come rev 1 8 ix 16 having considered and commended to faith the divine generation of our lord and the dispensation with regard to his manhood in order to complete what we believe about god we add and in the holy spirit the holy spirit is not by nature less than the father or the son but is if i may say so consubstantial and co eternal with them that trinity is one god not that father son and holy spirit are identically the same but the father is father the son is son and the holy spirit is holy spirit and this trinity is one god as it is written hear o israel the lord thy god is one god deut 6 4 and yet if we are asked about the several persons e.g is the father god we shall reply he is god if the same question is asked about the son we shall give the same answer nor if the same question were asked about the holy spirit ought we to say anything else than that he is god but we have to be very careful to avoid the sense in which it is said of men ye are gods ps 82 6 these are not gods by nature who are made and fashioned by the father through the son by the gift of the holy spirit the trinity is signified when the apostle says for of him and through him and to him are all things rom 1 1 36 therefore although when we are asked about the several persons and answer that each is god whether it be the father or theson or the holy spirit no one is to think that we worship three gods augustine earlier writings 362 17 it is not surprising that we speak like this about an in effable nature for something similar is met with even in things which we see with our bodily eyes and judge with our bodily senses when we are asked about a fountain we cannot call it a river and when we are asked about a river we cannot call it a fountain and if we take a drink from a fountain or a river we cannot call it either a fountain or a river but we describe all these three things together or severally as water if i ask whether what is in the fountain or in the river or in the tumbler is water in each case the reply must be that it is and yet we do not say that there are three waters but only one certainly we must take care that no one imagines that the ineffable substance of the divine majesty is like a visible corporeal fountain or river or tumbler of water for the water which is now in the fountain does not remain there but flows out into the river and when a drink is taken from a fountain or a river it does not remain in the place from which it is taken accordingly it can happen that the same water can belong successively to the fountain the river and the drinking vessel but in the divine trinity the father cannot be now the son and again the holy spirit in a tree the root is simply the root the trunk the trunk and the branches are nothing but branches we do not use the word hoot of the trunk or the branches nor does the wood which belongs to the root pass in any way into the trunk or the branches but remains only in the root and yet the rule remains that the root is wood and the trunk and the branches are wood but we cannot say there are three woods but one only possibly because of a differ ence in strength these portions of a tree may be so unlike that it would not be absurd to speak of three kinds of wood at least all admit that if three goblets are filled from one fountain we may speak of three goblets but not of three waters but of water in the singular only if you were asked about the goblets severally you would reply that there is water in each of them although there is no passage from one to the other as we observed there was from the fountain into the river these corporeal examples have been given not because they bear any real resemblance to the divine nature but because they show the unity of visible things and to let you understand that it is possible for three things not only severally but also together to be designated by a singular noun so that no one may be surprised and think it absurd that we call the father and the son and the holy spirit god but hold that in that trinity there are not three gods but one only one substance faith and the creed 363 18 many learned and spiritual men have discoursed in many books about the father and the son trying to explain as far as men can explain to men how the father and the son are not one person but one substance and what the father is in himself and what the son is in himself how the father begets and the son is begotten how the father is not of the son but the son is of the father how the father is the principle of the son whence he is called the head of christ i cor 11 3 though christ also is principle but not of the father he is the image of the father though in no way dissimilar but altogether and indistinguishably equal these things are dealt with at greater length by those whose purpose it is to expound more fully than we are doing the profession of the whole christian faith the son as son has received existence from the father while the father has not received existence from the son so far as according to the temporal dispensation the son in ineffable compassion assumed human nature a mutable creature in order to change it for the better many things are found written in scripture which mislead the impious minds of heretics who wish to teach rather than to learn and give them an excuse for thinking that the son is not equal to the father nor of the same substance such are the father is greater than f john 14 28 the head of the woman is the man and the head of the man is christ and the head of christ is god i cor 11 3 then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him i cor 15 28 i go to my father and your father to my god and your god john 20 17 and some other similar passages these things are not written to signify any inequality of nature or substance otherwise these other passages would be false i and the father are one john 10 30 he who hath seen me hath seen the father john 14 9 the word was god john 1 1 for he was not made since all things were made through him he thought it not robbery to be equal with god phil 2 6 and there are other such passages the former passages are written partly on account of the economy of the incarnation for it is said that he emptied himself not that wisdom was changed for he is com pletely unchangeable but that he wished to make himself known to men in this humble manner partly then on account of this economy these passages were written which the heretics falsely interpret but partly also for this reason that the son owes the father his existence but owes him also his equality with the father the father on the other hand owes his existence to none 364 augustine earlier writings 19 but great and learned commentators of the divine scrip tures have not as yet discussed the doctrine of the holy spirit with the same fullness and care so that we may easily under stand his peculiar character as holy spirit by which he is to be distinguished from the father and the son but they declare that he is the gift of god so that we may believe that god gives no gift inferior to himself they take care however to declare that the holy spirit is not begotten of the father like the son for christ is unique nor was he begotten of the son as if he were the grandson of the father most high moreover he owes his existence to the father from whom are all things he does not exist in himself that would be to set up two independent principles instead of one which is utterly false and absurd and is the mark not of the catholic faith but of the error of some heretics some have even dared to believe that the holy spirit is the communion or deity so to speak of the father and the son their deorrjg as the greeks call it so as the father is god and the son is god the very deity which embraces both the father who begets the son and the son who cleaves to the father is equated with god by whom the son is begotten this meity by which they would have understood the mutual love and charity of both father and son they say is called the holy spirit and they adduce many proofs from scripture for their opinion for example the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit which is given unto us rom 5 5 there are many other similar testimonies and because we are reconciled to god through the holy spirit whence also he is called the gift of god they would have it clearly indicated that the holy spirit is the love of god for we are not reconciled to him save through love whereby we are also called sons for we are not under fear as slaves but perfect love casteth out fear and we have received the spirit of liberty whereby we cry abba father rom 8 15 because by love we are recon ciled and brought back to friendship and can know all the secret things of god it is of the holy spirit that it is written he will bring you into all truth john 16 13 hence the con fidence in preaching the truth which filled the apostles when the spirit came is rightly attributed to love for diffidence comes from fear which is excluded by perfect love likewise he is called the gift of god because no one enjoys what he knows unless he loves it to enjoy the wisdom of god is nothing else but to cleave to him in love and no one has an abiding grasp of anything unless he loves it moreover he is called holj faith and the creed 365 spirit since whatever is made holy is made holy in order to abide for ever and there is no doubt that the word sanctity is derived from sancire to make holy above all the asserters of this opinion make use of this testimony from scripture that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit for god is a spirit john 3 6 john 4 24 here he speaks of our regeneration which is not after the flesh accord ing to adam but after the holy spirit according to christ if they say it is the holy spirit that is spoken of in the words god is a spirit it ought to be observed that what is said is that god is a spirit not that the spirit is god hence the deity of the father and the son is here called god that is the holy spirit besides there is this other testimony where the apostle john says that god is love he does not say love is god but god is love so that deity may be understood to be love there is of course no mention of the holy spirit in that passage where many things are linked together all things are yours and ye are christ’s and christ is god’s i cor 3 21 23 and in the other passage the head of the woman is the man and the head of the man is christ and the head of christ is god i cor 1 1 3 but they say that this is due to the fact that where things are linked together the link that holds them together is not usually included among them hence those who read with close attention seem to recognize the trinity in the passage where it is written of him and through him and in him are all things of him points to him who owes existence to none through him points to the mediator and in him points to him who contains all things and binds them together 20 this view is contradicted by those who think that that communion whether we call it deity or love or charity is not a substance they want to have the holy spirit explained according to his substance and do not understand that god could not be said to be love unless love were a substance they are influenced by ordinary corporeal experience if two bodies are joined together so as to be set side by side the junction is not a body for if the two things which had been joined together are separated nothing else remains the junction cannot be understood to have moved away as the bodies parted company let such people make for themselves a clean heart so that they may be able to see that there cannot be in the substance of god both substance and accidents all that can be understood to be there is substance it is easy to speak about such things and even to believe them but they cannot be seen as they are save by the 366 augustine earlier writings pure heart whatever the true view may be in this matter we must hold with unshaken faith that the father is god and the son is god and the holy spirit is god that there are not three gods but that the trinity is one god that the persons are not diverse in nature but are of the same substance that the father is not now the son and now the holy spirit but that the father is always the father and the son always the son and the holy spirit always the holy spirit we must not rashly affirm any thing about invisible things as if we knew but only as those who believe these things can only be seen by the pure heart he who in this life sees them in part and in an enigma as it is written cannot by speaking about them let another see them who is hindered by uncleanness of heart blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god matt 5 8 this is our faith concerning god our maker and renewer x 21 we are commanded to love not only god but also our neighbour as it is written thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself unless the christian faith gather men together into a society in which brotherly love can operate it remains less fruitful hence we believe in the holy church that is to say the catholic church heretics and schismatics also call their congregations churches but heretics do violence to the faith by holding false opinions about god and schis matics although they believe as we believe have broken away from brotherly love by wicked separations wherefore heretics do not belong to the catholic church which loves god nor do schismatics for the church loves its neighbour and easily for gives his sins because it prays to be forgiven by him who has reconciled us to himself blotting out all past transgressions and calling us to new life until we attain perfect life we cannot be without sins but it makes all the difference what kind of sins we commit 22 there is no need now to deal with the differences between sins but we must by all means believe that our sins will not be forgiven if we are inexorable in refusing to forgive we accord ingly believe in the forgiveness of sins 23 man consists of three parts spirit soul and body some times there are said to be only two for soul and spirit are spoken of often as one thing whereof the rational part which beasts lack is called spirit then the life force by which we are united to our bodies is called the soul finally there is the body which because it is visible is called our lowest part this whole faith and the creed 367 creature groaneth and travaileth until now rom 8 22 but has put forth the first fruits of the spirit because it has believed god and has already a good will the spirit is also called mind of which the apostle says t serve the law of god with my mind rom 7 25 in another place he says god is my wit ness whom i serve in my spirit rom 1 9 but the soul is called flesh so long as it desires carnal goods for part of it resists the spirit not by nature but by sinful custom and habit hence it is written with my mind i serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin this custom has been changed into a veritable natural state in his mortal descendants by the sin of the first man therefore it is written we too were at one time by nature the children of wrath that is of the punishment by which we were made to serve the law of sin eph 2 3 the soul is by nature perfect when it is subject to its own spirit and follows the spirit as the spirit follows god the natural animalis soulish man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god the soul is not so speedily subjected to the spirit in order to perform good works as the spirit is subjected 4 o god to pro duce true faith and a good will sometimes its impulse to seek carnal and temporal things is with difficulty restrained but sometimes it is cleansed and recovers the stability of its nature under the mastery of the spirit for the spirit is the head of the soul as christ is the head of the spirit hence there is no need to despair of the body too being restored to its proper nature but not so speedily as the soul still less speedily than the spirit but at the opportune time at the last trump when the dead shall arise incorruptible and we shall be changed i cor 15 52 therefore we believe in the resurrection of the flesh that is to say not merely is the soul restored which is now called flesh in scripture on account of its carnal affections but also this visible flesh which is naturally flesh and which gives its name to the soul on account of the latter’s carnal affections in spite of its higher nature this visible flesh properly so called we must believe without hesitation rises again from the dead the apostle paul seems to have directly pointed his finger at the flesh when he wrote taw corruptible must put on in corruption when he says this he as good as points with his finger that which is visible can be pointed at in this way the soul cannot be pointed at though it can be called corruptible because it is corrupted by moral vices therefore paul is here speaking of flesh in its natural acceptation when we read this mortal must put on immortality again the visible flesh is 368 augustine earlier writings signified for again we have the same demonstrative pronoun for the soul can be said to be mortal as well as corruptible on account of its moral vices the death of the soul is to depart from god cp ecclesiasticus 10 12 this first sin committed in paradise is related in the sacred books 24 the body will rise again according to the christian faith which is infallible he who finds this incredible is fixing his attention on what the flesh is like now and is not considering what it will be like hereafter when it has been changed into an angelic thing there will be no longer flesh and blood but simply body speaking of flesh the apostle says there is one flesh of beasts another of birds another of fishes and serpents there are also bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial notice he does not say celestial flesh but celestial and terrestrial bodies i cor 15 40 all flesh is corporeal but every body is not flesh among terrestrial things wood is a corporeal thing but is not flesh while the body of man and beast is also flesh among celestial things there is no flesh but simple and shining bodies which the apostle calls spiritual but some call them ethereal so he does not deny the resurrection of the flesh when he says flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of god but declares what flesh and blood are to become if any man does not believe that common flesh can be changed into a nature of this sort he is to be led on to faith by gradual steps if you ask him whether earth can be changed into water that will not seem to him in credible because there is no great distance between these two elements again if you ask whether water can be changed into air he will agree that that is not absurd because these two ele ments are close neighbours let him next be asked about air whether it can be transformed into an ethereal body and again the close relation of the two elements will make it plausible now when he has admitted the possibility that earth can be transmuted by these stages into ethereal body why should it not be possible directly when god so wills it who once made it possible for a human body to walk upon the waters why should he not believe that it can happen without these intermediate steps in the twinkling of an eye as it is written i cor 15 52 just as smoke is often turned into flame with marvellous speed our flesh is no doubt derived from the earth philosophical arguments in proof of the assertion that no earthly object can be in heaven are often urged against faith in the resurrection of the flesh and yet the philosophers admit that any body can be changed and transformed into any other faith and the creed 369 when the resurrection of the body has taken place we shall be freed from our temporal condition and shall enjoy eternal life in ineffable charity and with a constancy that knows no cor ruption then shall it be as it is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is thy sting o death where is thy contention i cor 15 54 24 this is the faith which is handed over to young christians expressed in a few words which they are to hold faithfully these few words are made known to believers that believing they may subject themselves to god being so subject may live righteous lives living righteously they may cleanse their hearts and with a pure heart may know what they believe a.e.w 24 to simplician on various questions book i su augustine review of de quaestionibus ad simplicianum retractations y i i of the books which i wrote after i became a bishop the first two are answers to divers questions addressed to simplician who suc ceeded the blessed ambrose as bishop of milan in the first book i have set forth my answer to two questions concerning passages from the epistle of paul the apostle to the romans the first concerns romans 7 7 25 whereas the apostle says the law is spiritual but i am carnal etc showing that the flesh wars against the spirit i have expounded his words as if he were describing the man who is still under the law and not yet under grace long afterwards i learned that these words could also describe the spiritual man and indeed in all probability do so the second question concerns romans 9 10 29 in answering this question i have tried hard to maintain the free choice of the human will but the grace of god prevailed not otherwise could i reach the understanding that the apostle spoke with absolute truth when he said who made thee to diffisr what hast thou that thou didst not receive but if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou didst not receive it this truth cyprian the martyr too wanted to make clear and he ex pressed it completely in a phrase in nothing must we glory since nothing is ours 2 in the second book other questions are treated and solved according to our poor capacity they all come from the so called books of kings the first concerns the words the spirit of the lord came upon saul whereas in another place it is written an evil spirit from the lord came upon saul in expounding this i said though to will is in the power of any man ability to perform is not in his power the reason for saying this is precisely that we do not say a thing is in our power 370 to simpligian on various questions 371 unless what we will is done then willing is the first and chief consideration the will is there immediately when we will but we receive from above the power to live aright when the will is prepared by the lord the second question is what is the meaning of the words i repent that i have made saul king the third is whether the unclean spirit that was in the priestess of delphi could have brought it to pass that samuel appeared to saul and spoke with him the fourth explains king david entered and sat before the lord the fifth deals with the words of elijah o lord thou hast brought evil upon this widow with whom i sojourn in slaying her son to simplician on various questions book i introduction i n the eighth book of the confessions augustine tells us how in his growing spiritual distress he went to con sult simplician an aged presbyter of milan and a trusted friend and counsellor of ambrose to him he unfolded the tale of his wanderings in the maze of error and from him he re ceived encouragement to persevere in the study of the platonists because in their works god and his word are everywhere im plied simplician also told him about victorinus the trans lator of plotinus in whose conversion he had had a part victorinus an african by birth had acquired wide spread fame as an orator in rome and had so gained the friendship of many senators one day he announced to simplician that in his reading of the bible and the christian writers he had become convinced of the truth of christianity but he hesitated long before at last he openly confessed his faith by accepting bap tism publicly in the church in rome subsequently he suffered for his faith under the law of julian which excluded christians from the teaching profession the story naturally set augustine on fire to imitate him simplician’s spiritual help at this junc ture put augustine deeply in his debt and between the two men there was forged a bond of regard and affection in 397 simplician succeeded ambrose as bishop of milan some eighteen months after augustine had become coadjutor bishop of hippo the latter’s first literary work as bishop was to reply in two books to certain questions of biblical interpretation sent to him by simplician he says they were written at the very beginning of my episcopate and there is nothing to sug gest that the elevation of simplician had already taken place of these two books the fint contains the answers to simplician’s 372 to simpligian on various q uestions 373 first two questions a detailed exegesis of two difficult passages from the epistle to the romans and it is here translated not only as a good example of augustine’s exegetical work but also because it is generally held to mark an important stage in his understanding of st paul augustine himself recognized this and pointed it out in two of his latest works de praedestinatione sanctorum iv 8 and de dono perseverantiae xx 52 even before his conversion and doubtless owing to the in fluence of ambrose augustine had been reading the epistles of st paul and had found in them something that spoke to his condition perhaps even more directly than did the platonist books confessions vii xxi his copy was lying on his table when pontician called ibid viii vi whose story of st antony moved him profoundly and introduced the final scene in the drama of his conversion when the voice heard in the garden bade him take up and read it was to this book he turned opening it at random and chancing to light on romans 13 13 he saw there a divine call to abandon the world and his conversion was complete he took the book with him to cassiciacum and there read it through carefully from beginning to end contra acad.y ii ii 5 clear evidence that his whole activity during that period is not reflected in the dialogues most likely a pauline influence modifies and colours his platonism from the beginning and in time it becomes very marked not ably in de vera religione it is not surprising therefore that during his presbyterate he should have devoted much of his attention to the pauline epistles he wrote a commentary on galatians and planned another on romans but on such a gigantic scale that he abandoned it when he had dealt only with the first five verses of the address somewhat earlier a group of clergy in carthage which included augustine were studying the epistle to the romans and he made some comments which at the request of the brethren he committed to writing under the title of exposition of certain propositions from the epistle to the romans simplician’s questions concerned two of the passages which had there been briefly dealt with the first question concerns the crucial passage which has been and still is much disputed by theologians romans augustine’s new treatment of it is long and more elaborate but the interpretation remains as in the earlier exposition his main concern is to defend the old testament law as a good thing against its detractors it brings sin to consciousness and makes it more sinful through imparting to it the character of deliberate augustine earlier writings 374 and conscious transgression of the divine commandment it can not give the power to perform that which is right nevertheless it points out the way of righteousness and produces anxiety with regard to guilt so that the soul may be prepared to receive grace to be under the law is a higher state than to have no law augustine still accepts the view that in this passage the apostle is speaking in the character of a man set under the law and not yet under grace controversy with the pelagians forced him later to abandon this view contra duas epistolas pelagianorum i viii he came to see that baptized christians and even apostles could not in this life attain a state of perfect peace and righteousness even under grace the impulses of concupiscence have always to be resisted here he discovers the principle so important to luther and the reformers simul justus et peccator the second question has to do with the interpretation of romans 9 10 29 here the much harder problem of the rela tion of grace and free will is faced 2 the clue to its solution is to be sought in the purpose of the epistle as a whole which is to show that no man may glory in his own good works 3 this is strikingly illustrated in the extreme case of jacob’s being chosen and esau’s being rejected before either was born or had done aught of good or evil there could have been no question of selection or election on the strength of good works performed or even of faith in either case 5 the suggestion must be ruled out that the selection was made on the ground of the presence or absence of faith or good works which god foresaw would be forthcoming 7 faith is due to the calling of god and must be numbered among the gifts of grace it is therefore not meritori ous 8 if we say that god graciously calls a man bestows faith upon him and the power to do good works no difficulty arises but 10 why does he not do so in all cases is it because some are willing to hear and believe and others are unwilling for we cannot believe unwillingly 1 2 f ormally we have the power to will but the good will is the gift of god so that even willing is not wholly ours 13 what then of those who reject god’s call can they frustrate his gracious purpose rather we must say that some are effectually called others not so to some the call is made in such a way that they will hear and obey others are hardeined 16 two truths are sure fa there is no un righteousness with god b he treats men differently as he wills there is a higher hidden justice which is however re flected in human affairs a creditor may exact or remit a debt and in neither case is he chargeable with injustice certainly the to simpligian on various q uestions 375 debtors have no cause for complaint man may not question the ways of god 17 like the potter with the clay god makes vessels some to honour some to dishonour 19 all men are made of one lump a massa peccati and some are to be saved others are to be lost 21 to those whom he wills to save god provides a motive adequate to win them to faith and obedience 22 election therefore precedes justification god elects of his mere good pleasure those who are to be justified so that they may attain eternal life without election there can be neither faith nor obedience but god's judgments are inscrutable and his ways past finding out for all that he does he is to be praised augustine here has taken a step beyond his earlier exposition due as he tells us repeatedly to a better understanding of cer tain pauline expressions notably the election of grace there he was endeavouring to hold a balance between grace and free will it is ours to believe and to will it is god’s to give to those who believe and are willing the power to do good works through the holy spirit by whom love is spread abroad in our hearts now he teaches that god must himself graciously prepare the heart for faith so that faith too is to be numbered among the gifts of grace no less than the power to do good and man’s salvation is therefore wholly the work of god the moral difficulty involved in the assertion that god arbitrarily selects some and not others for his gracious aid is met with an appeal to his omnipotence and inscrutable justice man may not ques tion his maker’s judgments give what thou commandest and command what thou wilt the position is now reached in all its essential features which provoked the protest of pelagius and which had to be defended against the pelagians from 41 1 onwards to the end of augustine’s life to simplician on various questions book i the text preface very pleasing and agreeable is the honour you have done me father simplician in sending me your questions if i did not try to answer them i should be not only contumacious but also ungrateful the problems which you have propounded for me to solve from the apostle paul i had already discussed in writing but not content with my former inquiry and exposition in case i might have overlooked anything through negligence i have investigated with greater care and attention these same apostolic words and the tenor of his sentences for you would not have judged that they should be treated again if the understanding of them were easy and ready to hand first question romans 7 7 25 i your first question asks me to interpret the passage begin ning what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid down to i consent unto the law that it is good and so on down to o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death thanks be unto god through jesus christ our lord rom 7 7 25 in this passage the apostle seems to me to represent himself as a man set under the law and to speak in that character and because just before he had said we have been discharged from the law of death wherein we were holden so that we serve in newness of the spirit and not in the oldness of the letter and might by these words seem to have found fault with the law he added forthwith what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid howbeit i had not known sin but by the law for i had not known concupiscence except the law had said thou shalt not covet 376 to simpligian on various q uestions 377 2 but again if the law is not sin but introduces sin even so it is found fault with in these words therefore we must under stand that the law was given not to introduce sin nor to extir pate it but simply to make it known by the demonstration of sin to give the human soul a sense of its guilt in place of a secure sense of its innocence sin cannot be overcome without the grace of god so the law was given to convert the soul by anxiety about its guilt so that it might be ready to receive grace accord ingly he does not say without the law i had not committed sin but i had not known sin except through the law and again he does not say i had no concupiscence except the law had said thou shalt not covet but i had not known con cupiscence except the law had said thou shalt not covet hence it appears that concupiscence was not implanted in him by the law but was made known to him 3 the consequence was that concupiscence was even in creased since it could not be resisted when grace was not yet received for concupiscence acquires greater strength when in addition there is violation of a law it is aggravated when it is done against the law and becomes a worse sin than if there had been no law prohibiting it accordingly he adds sin finding occasion through the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence sin then existed before the law but did not reach its full sinfulness because there was so far no violation of a law so in another passage he says where there is no law there is no breaking of the law 4 he goes on without the law sin is dead that is as if he said sin is latent in other words is thought to be dead he is going to say that more clearly a little later i lived wdthout the law once he says i.e no fear of death because of sin ter rified me because sin was not made manifest when there was no law but when the commandment came sin revived i.e became manifest and i died i.e i knew that i was dead because the guilt of breaking the law was threatened by the cer tain punishment of death indeed when he says that sin revived when the commandment came he makes it perfectly clear that sin had lived before and had been known i suppose in the sin of the first man since he had received and violated a command ment in another place he says the woman being beguiled fell into transgression i tim 2 14 and again after the likeness of adam’s transgression who is a figure of him who was to come rom 5 14 in any case nothing can be said to re vive which did not live at some previous time but sin was dead 378 augustine earlier writings that is hidden all the time that men were born mortal and lived without the commandment of the law following the desires of the flesh in ignorance because there was no prohibi tion therefore he says i lived without the law once thereby he shows that he is not speaking in his own person but generally in the person of the old man but when the commandment came sin revived and i died the commandment which was unto life i found to be unto death but if the commandment is obeyed it surely gives life but it was found to be unto death because it was disobeyed now what is done contrary to the commandment is sin just as it was sinful even before the com mandment was given but now it is more abundantly and perniciously sinful because it is done knowingly and in trans gression of the commandment 5 for sin he says finding occasion through the com mandment deceived me and thereby slew me sin became sweeter wrongly using the law to increase desire which it was intended to forbid thereby it deceived him sweetness is deceptive because it is followed by much bitterness in the shape of punishment men who have not yet received spiritual grace find greater pleasure in doing what is forbidden and so sin deceives them with its false sweetness when there is added the sense of the guilt of transgression sin slays 6 accordingly the law is holy and the commandment holy just and good it commands what ought to be commanded and prohibits what ought to be prohibited was that which is good then made death to me god forbid the fault lies in making a bad use of the commandment which in itself is good the law is good if one use it lawfully i tim 1 8 but he makes a bad use of the law who does not subject himself to god in humble piety so that with the aid of grace he may become able to fulfil the law he who does not use the law lawfully receives it to no other end than that his sin which was latent before the prohibition should be made apparent by his trans gression and this above measure for it is not only sin but it is also contrary to direct commandment so he goes on sin that it might be shown to be sin worked death in me through that which is good that through the commandment sin might be come exceeding sinful here he makes clear in what sense he wrote the words without the law sin was dead not that it did not exist but that it was not made apparent and also what he meant by saying that sin revived not simply that that should exist which already existed before the law but that it to simpligian on various q uestions 379 should be made apparent by being committed against the law that is what he is saying here sin that it might be shown to be sin worked death in me through that which is good he does not say that there should be sin but that it should be shown to be sin 7 then he gives the cause why it should be so we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal thus he clearly shows that the law cannot be fulfilled except by spiritual persons and there cannot be such save by grace the more one is assimilated to the spiritual law the more one attains to a spiritual disposi tion the more one fulfils the law the more one delights in it the less one is afflicted by its burdensomeness and the more one is quickened by its light for the commandment of the lord is pure enlightening the eyes and the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul ps 19 8 when grace forgives sins and infuses a spirit of charity righteousness ceases to be hard and becomes even pleasant when he said i am carnal he raised the question of what carnal means people are called carnal in some degree who are already under grace redeemed by the blood of the lord and regenerated by faith to such the apostle writes i could not speak to you brethren as to spiritual but as carnal as babes in christ i have given you milk to drink not meat in so saying he shows that they had been regenerated by grace for they were babes in christ and had to be given milk to drink and he still calls them carnal he who is not yet under grace but is under the law is carnal in the sense that he is not yet regenerate from sin but is still sold under sin the price of deadly pleasure includes the sweetness which deceives and gives delight in doing contrary to the law which is all the more pleasant the less it is lawful no one can enjoy that sweetness as the price of his condition without being com pelled to serve lust as a chattel slave he who knows that an act is prohibited and rightly prohibited and yet does it knows that he is the slave of an overmastering desire 8 that which i do i know not this does not mean that he does not know that he is sinning for that would contradict what he said above sin that it might be shown to be sin worked death in me through that which is good i had not known sin save by the law obviously when he can use expressions like these he cannot mean that he is ignorant of having sinned he uses the word as the lord is going to use it when he will say to the impious i know you not nothing escapes the notice of god for the face of the lord is against them that do evil to 380 augustine earlier writings destroy the memory of them from the earth sometimes we say we do not know meaning that we do not approve so when he says that which i do i know not he means i approve not and he makes this clear in what follows not what i would that do i practise but what i hate that i do here he says he hates what he had just said he did not know now of those to whom the lord will say i know you not it is also said thou o lord dost hate all the workers of iniquity ps 5 5 9 if what i would not that i do i consent unto the law that it is good what he would not is what is also forbidden by the law therefore he consents unto the law not of course in so far as he does what the law prohibits but in so far as he does not will to do what he in fact does he is overcome because he is not yet free by grace but he already knows through the law that he is doing wrong and he does not really want to do that and he continues so now it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me he does not mean that he did not consent to do the wrong but that he consented to the law’s disapproba tion of the wrong he is still speaking in the person of a man under the law and not yet under grace who is brought to do wrong by some dominant desire and by some deceptive sweet ness associated with prohibited sin but he disapproves of this because of his knowledge of the law it is no more i that do it he says because he is overcome when he does it it is a desire that does it when we yield to an overmastering one grace brings it about that we do not yield and that the human mind is strengthened to resist desire of grace he will be speaking later 10 for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing so far as knowledge goes he consents unto the law but so far as action is concerned he yields to sin if it is asked how he knows that in his flesh dwelleth no good thing which means that sin dwells there how but from his inherited mortality and from his addiction to pleasure the former is the penalty of original sin the latter of repeated sinning we are born into this life with the former and add to the latter as we live these two things nature and custom conjoined render cupidity strong and unconquerable this is what he calls sin which he says dwells in his flesh obtaining a certain domination and king dom so to speak there hence the psalmist says i would rather be a slave in the house of the lord than dwell in the tents of sinners ps 84 10 as if a slave does not dwell in the place where he is a slave he no doubt means that to dwell must to simpligian on various q uestions 381 be understood as implying a certain rank if by grace we acbieve the condition described in another passage in these words that sin may not reign in our mortal body that we should obey the lusts thereof then sin cannot be said properly to dwell there 11 to will is present with me but to do that which is good i find not to those who do not rightly understand these words he seems by them to take away free will yet how does he do that when he says to will is present with me if that is so actual willing is certainly within our power that it is not in our power to do that which is good is part of the deserts of original sin this is not the original nature of man but the penalty of his guilt whereby mortality was brought in as a second nature from which the grace of our creator sets us free if we submit ourselves to him by faith these are the words of a man set under the law and not yet under grace he who is not yet under grace does not do the good he wills but the evil which he does not will being overcome by concupiscence which derives its strength from the fact not simply that he is mortal but also that he is burdened by the weight of custom but if he does what he wills not it is no longer he that does it but the sin that dwells in him as has been said and explained above 12 i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me that is i find the law is good for me when i wish to do what the law commands though it is easier to do evil which is present with me when he said above to will is present with me he was referring to its facility there is nothing easier for a man under the law than to will to do good and yet to do evil he has no difficulty in willing but it is not so easy to do what he wills it is easy to do what he hates even against his will just as a man thrown headlong has no difficulty in reaching the bottom though he does not want to and indeed hates it so i interpret the word is present so the man set under the law and not yet liberated by grace gives testimony to the law that it is good he does so by the very fact that he blames him self for acting contrary to the law he finds it a good thing for him because he wants to do what it commands but cannot because he is overcome by concupiscence thus he sees himself involved in the guilt of transgression so that he may implore the grace of the liberator 13 i delight in the law of god after the inward man that is the law which says thou shalt not covet but i see an other law in my members warring against the law of my mind 382 augustine earlier writings and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members a law in his members is the name he gives to the burden of mortality under which we groan being heavy laden a body which is corrupted burdens the soul so it often happens that what is not right gives pleasure and cannot be resisted this sorely pressing burden he calls a law because it has been imposed as a punishment by the divine judgment by god who gave man previous warning saying tn the day ye eat thereof ye shall surely die gen 2 17 this law warreth against the law of the mind which says thou shalt not covet in this law man rejoices after the inner man but before he is under grace the other law so wars against his mind that it brings him into captivity under the law of sin that is under itself in repeating which is in my members he shows that this is the same law as that referred to earlier as another law in my members 14 all this is said to show that a man who is thus taken cap tive ought not to presume on his own strength paul rebuked the jews for proudly glorying in the works of the law though con cupiscence attracted them to what was unlawful since the law in which they gloried said thou shalt not covet the man who is conquered damned and taken captive who is not vic torious even though he has received the law but is rather made a transgressor such a man must humbly cry o wretched man that i am who will deliver me from the body of this death thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord in this mortal life one thing remains for free will not that a man may fulfil righteousness when he wishes but that he may turn with suppliant piety to him who can give the power to fulfil it 15 in this whole closely argued passage of the apostle which we have expounded possibly some may think that the apostle feels that the law is an evil thing there are also these other pas sages the law came in that sin might abound rom 5 20 the ministration of death engraved in letters of stone 11 cor 3 7 the power of sin is the law i cor 15 56 ye are dead to the law by the body of christ that ye may become the property of another even of him who rose from the dead sinful passions which were through the law wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we have been discharged from the law of death wherein we were holden so that we may serve in newness of the spirit and not in oldness of the letter rom 7 4 6 and we can find other passages in the apostle of similar import but notice he does not mean to con to simplician on various q uestions 383 denm the law he says these things because the law increases concupiscence by prohibiting it and makes a man guilty as a transgressor of the law the law commands what men in their infirmity are not able to fulfil unless they turn piously to the grace of god those are said to be under the law over whom it exercises dominion that is those whom it punishes and it punishes all transgressors those who have received the law break it unless through grace they obtain power to do what it commands so it is that the law does not exercise dominion over those who are under grace and fulfil it by love though they were condemned when they were under the fear of the law 16 if the apostle’s words induce us to think that he is finding fault with the law what are we to make of these i delight in the law of god after the inward man he actually praises the law when he says that but it may be replied that here the apostle is speaking of another law the law of christ and not the law which was given to the jews so i ask which law is he speaking of when he says the law came that sin might abound they reply no doubt that which the jews received is he then speaking of the same law when he says sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought all manner of con cupiscence in me what is the difference between wrought all manner of concupiscence in me and that sin might abound observe also that that other statement is in complete agreement that sin by the commandment might become ex ceeding sinful that is the same thing as that sin might abound if we show that the commandment is a good thing from which sin took occasion to work all manner of concupiscence and to become exceeding sinful we have shown at the same time that the law is good which came that sin might abound i.e might work all manner of concupiscence and become ex ceeding sinful let them hear the apostle’s own words what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid this they say is said of the law of christ that is of the law of grace then what do they understand of what follows i had not known sin but by the law i had not known concupiscence did not the law say thou shalt not covet but sin took occasion through the commandment to work all manner of concupiscence in me the context of the words indicates sufficiently of what law he is speaking when he says is the law sin god forbid ob viously the law by whose commandment occasion was given to sin to work all manner of concupiscence the law therefore which came in afterwards that sin might abound the law which 384 augustine earlier writings they suppose to be evil what could be more clear than what he says soon after the law is holy and the commandment holy just and good again they say this does not refer to the law given to the jews but is spoken of the gospel that is the un speakably blind perv ersity of the manichees they pay no attention to the completely frank and clear sequel was that which is good made deatli to me god forbid but sin that it might be shown to be sin by working death to me through that which is good that through the commandment sin might be come exceeding sinful that is by a commandment that was holy just and good which nevertheless came that sin might abound i.e become exceeding sinful 17 why then if the law is good is it called a ministration of death because sin that it might be shown to be sin worked death for me through that which is good do not mar vel when it is said of the preaching of the gospel we are a sweet savour of christ unto god in them that are being saved and in them who perish to the one a savour of life to life to the other a savour of death to death ii cor 2 15 16 now the law is called a ministration of death to the jews for whom it was written on stone to symbolize their hardness of heart but this does not apply to those who fulfil the law in charity for charity is the fulfilment of the law rom 13 10 the law which was graven with letters of stone says thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not covet etc that law the apostle says is fulfilled by charity he that loveth his neighbour hath fulfilled the law for thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not covet and if there be any other command ment all are summed up in this word thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself rom 13 8 9 for of course this too is written in the same law why if the law is good is it the power of sin i cor 15 56 because sin wrought death by that which is good that it might become exceeding sinful i.e might ac quire greater powers by becoming also transgression why if the law is good are we dead to the law by the body of christ because we are dead to the law’s condemnation being set free from the disposition which the law condemns and punishes the more usual practice is to speak of law as sometihing that threatens terrifies and punishes so the same precept which is law to those who fear it is grace to those who love it hence the saying in the gospel the law was given through moses grace and truth came by jesus christ john 1 17 the same law to simpligian on various q uestions 385 that is that was given through moses to be feared was made grace and truth by jesus christ so that it might be fulfilled so the words ye are dead to the law should be taken to mean ye are dead to the punishment threatened by the law through the body of christ through which are remitted the sins which bound us to the law’s punishments if the law is good why did sinful passions which were through the law work in our mem bers to bring forth fruit unto death rom 7 5 here he wants us to understood the sinful passions of which i have already often spoken as an increase of concupiscence due to the pro hibition and as guiltily deserving punishment because of trans gression death is wrought through that which is good that sin might become exceeding sinful by the commandment if the law is good why are we set free from the law of death wherein we were holden so that we may serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of the letter rom 7 6 the law is letter to those vvho do not fulfil it in the spirit of charity to which the new testament belongs so those who are dead to sin are freed from the letter which holds guilty those who do not fully obey what is written the law is nothing else than a letter to those who can read it but cannot fulfil it it is not unknown to those for whom it was written but because it is known merely in so far as it is written and not as something loved and performed to such people it is nothing but letter a letter which brings no aid to those who read it but bears witness to their sins those who are renewed by the spirit are freed from its condemnation so that tliey are no longer bound to the letter for punishment but are joined to understanding through righteousness hence the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life ii cor 3 6 the law when merely read and not understood or fulfilled lalleth in that case it is called the letter but the spirit giveth life because the fulfilment of the law is charity shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit which is given to us rom 5 5 the second question romans 9 10 29 i now i think it is time to turn to the second question you have propounded which concerns the interpretation of romans 9 10 29 from not only so but rebecca also conceived down to we had been made like unto gomorrah you ask that the whole passage be discussed and indeed it is rather obscure but to be sure i know your regard for me and am certain that yon would not bid me expound that passage unless you had prayed a.e.w 23 386 augustine earlier writings the lord to give me the ability to do so with confidence in his help i approach the task 2 first i shall try to grasp the apostle’s purpose which runs through the whole epistle and i shall seek guidance from it it is that no man should glory in meritorious works in which the israelites dared to glory alleging that they had served the law that had been given to them and that for that reason they had received evangelical grace as due to their merits so they were unwilling that the same grace should be given to the gentiles as if they were unworthy of it unless they undertook to observe the jewish sacred rites this problem arose and is settled in the acts of the apostles the jews did not understand that evan gelical grace just because of its very nature is not given as a due reward for good works otherwise grace is not grace in many passages the apostle frequently bears witness to this put ting the grace of faith before works not indeed that he wants to put an end to good works but to show that works do not precede grace but follow from it no man is to think that he has received grace because he has done good works rather he could not have done good works unless he had received grace through faith a man begins to receive grace from the moment when he begins to believe in god being moved to faith by some internal or external admonition but the fullness and evidentness of the infusion of grace depends on temporal junctures and on sacra mental rites catechumens are not unbelievers otherwise cornelius did not believe in god although by hds prayers and alms he showed himself worthy to have an angel sent to him but these good deeds would have had no effect had he not already believed and he would not have believed had he not been called by some secret admonition coming through visions of the mind or spirit or by more open admonitions reaching him through the bodily senses in some there is the grace of faith but not enough to obtain the kingdom of heaven as in cate chumens or in cornelius himself before he was incorporated into the church by participation in the sacraments in others there is so much grace that they are already reputed to belong to the body of christ and the holy temple of god the temple of god is holy says the apostle which temple ye are i cor 3 17 and the lord himself says except a man be born again of water and the holy spirit he shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven john 3 5 there are therefore inchoate beginnings of faith which resemble conception it is not enough to be conceived a man must also be bom if he is to attain to to simpligian on various q uestions 387 eternal life none of these beginnings is without the grace of god’s mercy and good works if there are any follow and do not precede that grace as has been said 3 this is the truth the apostle wanted to urge just as in an other passage he says by the grace of god we are saved and that not of ourselves it is the gift of god it is not of works lest any man should boast eph 2 8 9 and so he gave a proof from the case of those who had not yet been born no one could say that jacob had conciliated god by meritorious works before he was born so that god should say of him the elder shall serve the younger so not only so he says was isaac promised in the words at this time i will come and sarah shall have a son rom 9 9 now isaac had not conciliated god by any previous meritorious works so that his birth should have been promised and that in isaac abraham’s seed should be called gen 21 12 that means that those are to belong to the lot of the saints in christ who know that they are the sons of promise who do not wax proud of their merits but account themselves co heirs with christ by the grace of their calling when the promise was made that they should be this they did not as yet exist and so could have merited nothing rebecca also having conceived by one even by our father isaac he is most careful to note that it was by one act of coition that twins were conceived so that nothing could be attributed to the merits of the father as if someone might say the son was born such as he was because his father had such or such a disposition when he lay with his wife or that his mother was disposed in such a way when she conceived a son both were begotten and conceived at one and the same time and for another reason he stresses this fact so as to give no opportunity to astrologers or to those who are called calculators of nativities who conjecture the char acters and destinies of those who are born from their natal hours they can find absolutely no explantion why there was so great a diversity in these twins when they were conceived at one moment of time and under the same position of the stars and the heavens so that it was quite impossible to discover any thing wherein the one differed from the other they can easily learn if they will that the replies they sell to poor deluded folk have no basis in any kind of scientific knowledge but only in chance guess work but to return to the matter in hand these things are related to break and cast down the pride of men who are not grateful for the grace of god but dare to glory in their own merits for the children being not yet born and having done 388 augustine earlier writings nothing either good or e dl not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger grace is therefore of him who calls and the consequent good works are of him who receives grace good works do not produce grace but are produced by grace fire is not hot in order that it may burn but because it burns a wheel does not run nicely in order that it may be round but because it is round so no one does good works in order that he may receive grace but because he has received grace how can a man live justly who has not been justified how can he live holily who has not been sanctified or indeed how can a man live at all who has not been vivified grace justifies so that he w ho is justified may live justly grace therefore comes first then good works as he says in another place to him that worketh the reward is not reckoned as of grace but as of debt rom 4 4 there is of course the pas sage where he speaks of immortality after good works as if he really demands it as his due for he says i have fought the good fight i have finished the course i have kept the faith hence forth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall render to me at that day ii tim 4 7 8 do you think perhaps that because he said shall render he meant that it was his due but when he ascended on high and took captivity captive he did not render but gave gifts to men how could the apostle speak presump tuously as of a debt being paid back to him unless he had first received grace which was not due to him being justified by which he fought the good fight for he was a blasphemer a persecutor and injurious but he obtained mercy as he testifies himself believing in him who justifies not the pious but the ungodly in order that by justifying him he may make him godly 4 not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger the point of this is made clear by the preceding words when they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or evil clearly it was not of works but of him that calleth but here we must inquire why he says that the purpose of god according to election might stand how can election be just indeed how can there be any kind of election where there is no difference if jacob was elected before he was born and before he had done anything at all for no merit of his own he could not have been elected at all there being nothing to distinguish him for election if esau was rejected for no fault of his own because he too was not born to simpligian on various q uestions 389 and had done nothing when it was said the elder shall serve the younger how can his rejection be said to be just how are we to understand what follows if we judge according to the stan dards of equity jacob have i loved but esau have i hated now that is written in the prophet malachi 1 2 3 prophesied long after they were born and dead yet the sentence seems to be referred to which was spoken before they were born or had done anything the elder shall serve the younger but how could there be election or what kind of election could there be if there was no distinction of merits because they were not yet bom and had done nothing possibly there was some distinction in their natures who could support such a conclusion seeing that they sprang from one father one mother one act of intercourse one creator from the same land the same creator can produce different kinds of living creatures gan it be that the creator produced from one human marriage and embrace twin offspring so diverse that he loved the one and hated the other there would then be no election before that which was chosen existed if jacob was created good so that he might be loved how could he be loved before he existed in order that he might become good accord ingly he was not elected that he might become good but having been made good he could be elected 5 could it be according to election because god has fore knowledge of all things and foresaw tht faith that was to be in jacob even before he was born no one merits justification by his good works since unless he is justified he cannot do good works nevertheless god justifies the gentiles by faith and no one believes except of his own free will so god foreseeing that jacob would believe of his own free will by his foreknowledge elected to justify one not yet born if election is by foreknow ledge and god foreknew jacob’s faith how do you prove that he did not elect him for his works neither jacob nor esau had yet believed because they were not yet born and had as yet done neither good nor evil but god foresaw that jacob would believe he could equally well have foreseen that he would do good works so just as one says he was elected because god fore knew that he was going to believe another might say that it was rather because of the good works he was to perform since god foreknew them equally well how then does the apostle show that it was not of works that it was said the elder shall serve the younger if the reason for its not being of works was that they were not yet born that applies also to faith for before they 390 augustine earlier writings were born they had neither faith nor works the apostle there fore did not want ns to understand that it was because of god’s foreknowledge that the younger was elected to be served by the elder he wanted to show that it was not of works and he stressed that by saying when they were not yet born and had done neither good nor evil he could have said if he wished to that god already knew what each was going to do we have still to inquire why that election was made it was not of works because being not yet born they had done no works but neither was it of faith because they had not faith either what then was the reason for it 6 are we to say that there could have been no election unless there had been even when they were in their mother’s womb some difference of faith or works or merit of some kind but the apostle says that the purpose of god according to election might stand that is why we have to ask the question possibly we are to make a distinction here perhaps we should connect the words that the purpose of god according to election might stand with what precedes rather than with what fol lows it may mean not that the elder shall serve the younger in order that the purpose of god according to election may stand but rather that children who are not yet born and have done nothing are given as an example that no election is here to be understood if we read when they were not yet born and had done neither good nor evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand it would mean that they had done neither good nor evil so that there could be no election on account of his good deeds of the one who had done good there could be no election on account of good works according to which the purpose of god might stand so not of works but of him that calleth that is of god who justifies the ungodly by grace calling him to faith it was said to her the elder shall serve the younger so that the purpose of god does not stand according to election but election is the result of the purpose of god that is to say it is not because god finds good works in men so that he may elect them that his justifying purpose stands but because his purpose to justify them that believe stands he consequently finds good works which he can elect for the kingdom of heaven if there was no election there could be no elect and it would have been wrong to say who shall lay any charge against god’s elect rom 8 33 election does not precede justification but follows it no one is elected unless he is different from him who is rejected it is written that god to simplician on various q uestions 39i elected us before the foundation of the world eph 1 4 i do not see how that could be except by the way of foreknowledge but here when he says not of works but of him that calleth he wants us to understand that it is not by election through merits but by the free gift of god so that no man may exult in his good works by the grace of god are we saved and that not of ourselves for it is the gift of god not of works that no man should glory eph 2 8 7 but the question is whether faith merits a man’s justifica tion whether the merits of faith do not precede the mercy of god or whether in fact faith itself is to be numbered among the gifts of grace notice that in this passage when he said not of works he did not say but of faith it was said to her the elder shall serve the younger no he said but of him that calleth no one believes who is not called god calls in his mercy and not as rewarding the merits of faith the merits of faith follow his calling rather than precede it how shall they believe whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher rom 10 14 unless therefore the mercy of god in calling precedes no one can even believe and so begin to be justified and to receive power to do good works so grace comes before all merits christ died for the ungodly the younger received the promise that the elder should serve him from him that calleth and not from any meritorious works of his own so the scripture jacob have i loved is true but it was of god who called and not of jacob’s righteous works 8 what then of esau of whom it is written that he shall serve the younger and esau have i hated how could he have merited this by evil deeds of his own doing since these things were spoken before he was born and before he had done aught of good or evil possibly just as jacob received the promise without any meritorious acts of his own so esau was hated though he had done no evil to merit hatred if god pre destined esau to serve his younger brother because he foreknew the evil works that he was to do he must also have predestined jacob to be served by his elder brother because he foreknew his future good works in that case it would be false to say that it was not of works if it is true that it was not of works and that is proved by the fact that it was said before they were born and before they had done any works at all or of faith for again similarly there could be no faith in children not yet born how did esau deserve to be hated before he was born that god made one he was to love is unquestionably true but it is augustine earlier writings 392 absurd to say that he made some one he was going to hate for another scripture says thou abhorrest none of the things which thou didst make for never wouldest thou have formed anything if thou didst hate it wisdom 11 24 by what merit did the sun deserve to be made as it is how did the moon offend so as to be made so much inferior how did the moon earn the right to be made so much brighter than the other stars all these were created good each in its own kind god would not say the sun have i loved but the moon i have hated or the moon have i loved but the stars have i hated as he said jacob have i loved but esau have i hated he loved them all though he ordained them in different degrees of excel lence for god saw that they were good when they were created at his word that he hated esau is unjust unless the hatred was merited by injustice on esau’s part if we admit this then jacob must be loved because he had merited to be loved by his justice and if that is true it is false to say that it was not of works could it possibly be from the righteousness of faith but what support for that view can you get from the words when they were not yet born not even the righteousness of faith can exist in one who is not yet born 9 the apostle saw the questions that might ari e in the mind of the hearer or reader of these words and so he immedi ately added what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god god forbid and as if to teach us how there is no unrighteousness he goes on for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will show compassion to him on whom i will have compassion does he solve the question in these words or at least narrow it down if god will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and show compassion to whom he will show compassion our chief difficulty remains which is why did his mercy fail in esau’s case why was not esau too made good by god’s mercy as jacob was made good perhaps the real import of the words is this if god will have mercy on a man so as to call him he will also have mercy on him so that he may believe and on him on whom he in mercy bestows faith he will show compassion i.e will make him compassionate so that he may also perform good works so we are admonished that no one ought to glory or exult in his works of mercy as if he had propitiated god by meritorious works of his own god gave him the power to be merciful when he showed compassion on whom he would show compassion if anyone boasts that he has merited compassion by his faith let him know to simpligian on various q uestions 393 that god gave him faith god shows compassion by inspiring faith in one on whom he had compassion in giving to one who was still an unbeliever a share in his calling for already the believer is distinguished from the ungodly what hast thou that thou didst not receive but if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it i cor 4 7 10 this is all right but why was this mercy withheld from esau so that he was not called and had not faith inspired in him when called and was not by faith made compassionate so that he might do good works was it because he was unwilling if jacob had faith because he willed it then god did not give him faith as a free gift but jacob gave it to himself and so had some thing which he did not receive or can no one believe unless he wills or will unless he is called and can no one be called unless god by calling him also gives him faith for no one can believe unless he is called although none can believe against his will how shall they believe whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher no one therefore be lieves who has not been called but not all believe who have been called for many are called but few are chosen matt 22 14 the chosen are those who have not despised him who calls but have believed and followed him there is no doubt that they believed willingly what then of what follows so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that hath mercy does it mean that we cannot even will unless we are called and that our willing is of no avail unless god give us aid to perform it we must both will and run it would not be said in vain on earth peace to men of good will luke 2 14 and even so run that ye may attain i cor 9 24 but it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that hath mercy that we obtain what we wish and reach what we desire esau then was imwiiling and did not run had he been willing and had he run he would have obtained the help of god who by calling him would have given him the power both to will and to run had he not been reprobate by despising the calling there are two different things that god gives us the power to will and the thing that we actually will the power to will he has willed should be both his and ours his because he calls us ours because we follow when called but what we actually will he alone gives le the power to do right and to live happily for ever but esau was not yet born and con sequently could be neither willing nor unwilling in all these matters why was he rejected when he was still in the womb 394 augustine earlier writings we come back to that difficulty troubled not only by the ob scurity of the question but also by our own abundant repetition 11 why was esau rejected when he was not yet born and could neither believe him who called nor despise his calling nor do aught either good or evil if it was because god fore knew that his will was to be evil in the future why was not jacob approved because god foreknew that his will was to be good if you admit that anyone could have been approved or rejected for some quality he did not yet possess but because god foreknew that he would possess it in the future it follows that he could also have been approved for the works which god fore knew that he would perform some day though he had as yet performed none of them you will get no support at all for that view from the fact that they were not born when it was said the elder shall serve the younger you will not be able to show from that that because neither of them had done any works it could be said that the call was not of works 12 if you pay close attention to these words therefore it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that hath mercy you will see that the apostle said that not only because we attain what we wish by the help of god but also with the meaning which he expresses in another passage work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure phil 2 12 13 there he clearly shows that the good will itself is wrought in us by the working of god if he said it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that hath mercy simply because a man’s will is not sufficient for us to live justly and righteously unless we are aided by the mercy of god he could have put it the other way round and said it is not of god that hath mercy but of the man that willeth because it is equally true that the mercy of god is not sufficient of itself unless there be in addition the consent of our will clearly it is vain for us to will unless god have mercy but i do not know how it could be said that it is vain for god to have mercy unless we willingly consent if god has mercy we also will for the power to will is given with the mercy itself it is god that worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure if we ask whether a good will is a gift of god i should be sur prised if anyone would venture to deny that but because the good will does not precede calling but calling precedes the good will the fact that we have a good will is rightly attributed to god who calls us and the fact that we are called cannot be to simpligian on various q uestions 395 attributed to ourselves so the sentence it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that hath mercy cannot be taken to mean simply that we cannot attain what we wish without the aid of god but rather that without his calling we cannot even will 13 but if that calling is the effectual cause of the good will so that every one who is called follows it how will it be true that many are called but few are chosen if this is true and con sequently not everyone who is called obeys the call but has it in the power of his will not to obey it could be said correctly that it is not of god who hath mercy but of the man who wil leth and runneth for the mercy of him that calleth is not sufficient unless the obedience of him who is called follows pos sibly those who are called in this way and do not consent might be able to direct their wills towards faith if they were called in another way so that it would be true that many are called but few are chosen many that is to say are called in one way but all are not affected in the same way and those only follow the calling who are found fit to receive it it would be no less true that it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that hath mercy for god calls in the way that is suited to those who follow his calling the call comes also to others but because it is such that they cannot be moved by it and are not fitted to receive it they can be said to be called but not chosen and again it would not be true that it is not of god who hath mercy but of man who willeth and runneth for the effectiveness of god’s mercy cannot be in the power of man to frustrate if he will have none of it if god wills to have mercy on men he can call them in a way that is suited to them so that they will be moved to understand and to follow it is true therefore that many are called but few chosen those are chosen who are effectually congruenter called those who are not effectually called and do not obey their calling are not chosen for although they were called they did not follow again it is true that it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that hath mercy for although he calls many he has mercy on those whom he calls in a way suited to them so that they may follow but it is false to say that it is not of god who hath mercy but of man who ydlleth and runneth because god has mercy on no man in vain he calls the man on whom he has mercy in the way he knows will suit him so that he will not refuse the call 14 here someone will say why was not esau called in such 396 augustine earlier writings a way that he would be willing to obey we see that people are variously moved to believe when the same facts are shown or explained to them for example simeon believed in our lord jesus christ when he was still a little child for the spirit re vealed the truth to him nathanael heard but one sentence from him before philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee john i 48 and he replied rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel long after peter made the same confession and for that merit heard himself pronounced blessed and that the keys of the kingdom of heaven were to be given to him his disciples believed on him when by a miracle in cana of galilee water was turned into wine which the evangelist john records as the beginning of the signs of jesus he stirred many to believe by his words but many did not believe though the dead were raised even his disciples were terrified and shattered by his cross and death but the thief be lieved at the very moment when he saw him not highly exalted but his own equal in sharing in crucifixion one of his disciples after his resurrection believed not so much because his body was alive again as because of his recent wounds many of those who crucified him who had despised him while he was working his miracles believed when his disciples preached him and did similar miracles in his name since then people are brought to faith in such different ways and the same thing spoken in one way has power to move and has no such power when spoken in another way or may move one man and not another who would dare to affirm that god has no method of calling whereby even esau might have applied his mind and yoked his will to the faith in which jacob was justified but if the obstinacy of the will can be such that the mind’s aversion from all modes of calling becomes hardened the question is whether that very hardening does not come from some divine penalty as if god abandons a man by not calling him in the way in which he might be moved to faith who would dare to affirm that the omnipotent lacked a method of persuading even esau to believe 15 but why do we ask such a question the apostle himself goes on the scripture saith unto pharaoh for this very pur pose did i raise thee up that i might show in thee my power and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth the apostle adds this as an example to prove what he had said above that it is not of him that willeth nor of him that run neth but of god that hath mercy as if some one had said to to simplician on various q uestions 397 hlnij what is the source of this doctrine of yours his reply is the scripture saith unto pharaoh etc thus he shows that it is not of him that willeth but of god that hath mercy and he concludes with these words so then he hatli mercy on whom he will and whom he will he hardeneth earlier he had not stated both of these truths he said it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that hath mercy but he did not say it is not of him that is unwilling nor of him that contemneth but of god who causeth the hardening of the heart so by putting both sides he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth we are given to understand that the new statement agrees with the former one viz the hardening which god causes is an unwillingness to be merciful we must not think that anything is imposed by god whereby a man is made worse but only that he provides nothing whereby a man is made better but if there be no dis tinction of merits who would not break out into the objection which the apostle brings against himself thou wilt say then unto me why doth he still find fault for who withstandeth his will god often finds fault with men because they will not believe and live righteously as is apparent from many passages of scripture hence faithful people who do the will of god are said to walk blamelessly because scripture finds no fault with them but he says why does he find fault who withstandeth his will though he hath mercy on whom he will and whom he will he hardeneth let us look at what was said above and let it direct our interpretation as the lord himself gives us aid 16 the apostle said a little before what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god god forbid let this truth then be fixed and unmovable in a mind soberly pious and stable in faith that there is no unrighteousness with god let us also believe most firmly and tenaciously that god has mercy on whom he will and that whom he will he hardeneth that is he has or has not mercy on whom he will let us believe that this belongs to a certain hidden equity that cannot be searched out by any human standard of measurement though its effects are to be observed in human affairs and earthly arrangements unless we had stamped upon these human affairs certain traces of supernal justice our weak minds would never look up to or long for the holy and pure ground and source of spiritual precepts blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled in the drought of our mortal condition in this life it would be a case of being burnt up rather than of 398 augustine earlier writings merely thirsting did not some gentle breath of justice from on high scatter showers upon us human society is knit together by transactions of giving and receiving and things are given and received sometimes as debts sometimes not no one can be charged with unrighteousness who exacts what is owing to him nor certainly can he be charged with unrighteousness who is prepared to give up what is owing to him this decision does not lie with those who are debtors but with the creditor this image or as i said trace of equity is stamped on the business transac tions of men by the supreme equity now all men are a mass of sin since as the apostle says tn adam all die i cor 15 22 and to adam the entire human race traces the origin of its sin against god sinful humanity must pay a debt of punishment to the supreme divine justice whether that debt is exacted or re mitted there is no unrighteousness it would be a mark of pride if the debtors claimed to decide to whom the debt should be remitted and from whom it should be exacted just as those who were hired to work in the vineyard were unjustly indignant when as much was given to the others as was duly paid to them selves matt 20 11 ff so the apostle represses the impudent questioner o man who art thou that repliest against god a man so speaks back to god when he is displeased that god finds fault with sinners as if god compelled any man to sin when he simply does not bestow his justifying mercy on some sinners and for that reason is said to harden some sinners not because he drives them to sin but because he does not have mercy upon them he decides who are not to be offered mercy by a standard of equity which is most secret and far removed from human powers of understanding tnscrutable are his judgments and his ways past finding out rom 11 33 he justly finds fault with sinners because he does not compel them to sin justly also he has mercy on some that they may have this calling to be heartily penitent when god finds fault with sinners and to turn to his grace he finds fault therefore both justly and mercifully 17 to be sure no one resists his will he aids whom he will and he leaves whom he will both he who is aided and he who is left belong to the same mass of sin both deserve the punishment which is exacted from the one and remitted to the other if you are troubled by this o man who art thou that repliest against god i think man has the same meaning here as in that other passage are ye not men and walk according to man there the word denotes carnal and animal people to whom it is said i could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto to simpligian on various q uestions 399 carnal for ye were not yet able to bear it nay not even now are ye able for ye are yet carnal i cor 3 1 3 and again the animal natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god i cor 2 14 so the apostle continues in our pre sent passage o man who art thou that repliest against god does the thing formed say to him that formed it why didst thou make me thus hath not the potter power over the clay from the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and an other unto dishonour possibly he shows clearly enough that he is speaking to the carnal man because he refers to the clay from which the first man was formed and because as i have recalled according to the same apostle all die in adam he speaks as if all formed one mass though one vessel is made unto honour and another unto dishonour nevertheless that which is made unto honour must begin as carnal and rise to the spiritual state though they were made unto honour and were already born in christ yet because he was addressing them still as children he even calls them carnal saying t could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal as babes in christ i gave you milk to drink not meat for ye were not able to bear it nay not even now are ye able for ye are yet carnal he says they are carnal though they have been born in christ and are babes in christ and must be fed with milk in adding nor are ye yet able he shows that those who make progress will one day be able because seeing that they have already been spiritually re born grace has begun its work in them these people were therefore already vessels made unto honour to whom it could nevertheless be rightly said o man who art thou that repliest against god if that can be rightly said to such people much more can it be said to those who either are not yet so regenerated or even have been made unto dishonour only let us hold fast with unshakable faith the fact that there is no unrighteousness with god so that whether he remits or exacts the debt he cannot rightly be charged with unrighteousness by him from whom he exacts it and he who receives remission ought not to glory in his own merits the former pays back nothing but what he owes and the latter has nothing that he has not received 18 at this point we must try if the lord will help us to see how both of these scripture passages can be true thou hatest nothing that thou hast made and jacob i have loved but esau have i hated the potter remember made one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour now if he hated 400 augustine earlier writings esau because he was a vessel made unto dishonour how could it be true that thou hatest nothing which thou hast made for in that case god hated esau though he had himself made him a vessel unto dishonour this knotty problem is solved if we understand god to be the artificer of all creatures every creature of god is good every man is a creature as man but not as sinner god is the creator both of the body and of the soul of man neither of these is evil and god hates neither he hates nothing which he has made but the soul is more excellent than the body and god is more excellent than both soul and body being the maker and fashioner of both in man he hates nothing but sin sin in man is perversity and lack of order that is a turning away from the creator who is more excellent and a turning to the creatures which are inferior to him god does not hate esau the man but hates esau the sinner as it is said of the lord he came unto his own and his own received him not john i:ii to them also he said himself for this cause ye hear not because ye are not of god john 8 47 how can they be his own and yet be not of god the first statement must be taken as regarding them as men whom the lord himself had made the second as regarding them as sinners whom the lord rebuked they are both men and sinners men as fashioned by god sinners by their own wills was not jacob a sinner then seeing that god loved him but god loved in him not the sin which he had blotted out but the grace which he had freely given him christ died for the ungodly not that they should re main ungodly but that they should be justified and converted from their impiety believing in him who justifies the ungodly for god hates impiety in some he punishes it with damnation in others he removes it by justification doing what he judges right in his inscrutable judgments those of the number of the godless whom he does not justify he makes vessels unto dis honour but he does not hate that in them which he has made though of course they are hateful in so far as they are godless in so far as he has made them vessels he made them for some use that vessels made unto honour may learn from the penalties duly ordained for the evil accordingly god does not hate them as men or as vessels that is not in so far as he created them and ordained their punishment he hates nothing which he has made in making them vessels of perdition he makes them for the correction of others he hates their impiety which he did not make a judge hates theft but he does not hate send ing the thief to the mines the thief is responsible for the crime to simplician on various q uestions 4oi the judge for the sentence so god in making vessels of perdi tion from the lump of the impious does not hate what he does i.e his work of ordaining due penalty for those who perish for thereby those on whom he has mercy may find an opportunity of salvation so it was said to pharaoh for this very purpose did i raise thee up that i might show in thee my power and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth this demonstration of the power of god and proclamation of his name in all the earth is of advantage to those to whom it is a calling perfectly suited to their condition so that they may learn from it to fear and to correct their ways so the apostle goes on what if god willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long suffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction through all this you can hear as an undertone who art thou that repliest against god that must be understood as a recurring refrain if god willing to show his wrath endured vessels of wrath who art thou that repliest against god but not only is it to be understood with the words just quoted but also with the words that follow that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy there is no advantage for vessels fitted unto destruction that god patiently endures them to destroy them in due order and to use them as a means of salvation for those on whorn he has mercy but there is advantage for those for whose salvation god uses this means as it is written the just shall wash his hands in the blood of the wicked ps 58 10 i.e he shall be cleansed from evil works by the fear of god when he sees the punishment of sinners that god shows his wrath in bearing with vessels of wrath avails to set a useful example to others but also to make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy which he prepared unto glory the hardening of the ungodly demon strates two things that a man should fear and turn to god in piety and that thanks should be given for his mercy to god who shows by the penalty inflicted on some the greatness of his gift to others if the penalty he exacts from the former is not just he makes no gift to those from whom he does not exact it but because it is just and there is no unrighteousness with god who punishes who is sufficient to give thanks to him for he remits a debt which if god wanted to exact it no man could deny was justly the jews only but also from the gentiles that is to say we also are vessels of mercy which he has prepared unto glory he did not call all the jews but 402 augustine earlier writings some of them nor did he call all the gentiles but some of them from adam has sprung one mass of sinners and godless men in which both jews and gentiles belong to one lump apart from the grace of god if the potter out of one lump of clay makes one vessel unto honour and another unto dis honour it is manifest that god has made of the jews some vessels unto honour and others unto dishonour and similarly of the gentiles it follows that all must be understood to belong to one lump then the apostle begins to bring forward prophetic attestation to both of these classes but he reverses the order for he had spoken first of the jews and then of the gentiles but he first brings forward testimony concerning the gentiles and then concerning the jews as hosea says i will call that my people which was not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and it shall be that in the place where it was said ye are not my people there they shall be called sons of the living god this must be understood as spoken of the gentiles because they had no one fixed place of sacrifices as the jews had at jerusalem the apostles were sent to the gentiles that all who believed wherever they believed might in that place offer a sacrifice of praise because god had given them the power to become sons of god and isaiah crieth concerning israel lest it should be believed that all israelites had gone to perdi tion he teaches that from among them too some were made vessels unto honour others unto dishonour if he says the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be saved the multitude of the others are vessels fitted for destruction the lord will consummate his word upon earth and cut it short that is he will save by grace those who believe using the short way of faith and not the innumer able observances which like a servile yoke pressed hard upon the jewish multitude by grace he consummated his word to us and cut it short upon earth saying my yoke is easy and my burden is light matt 11 30 a little later the apostle writes the word is nigh thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach because if thou shaft confess with thy mouth that jesus is lord and shaft believe in thy heart that god raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation rom 10 8 ff this is the finished and short word that god has done upon earth by its perfection and brevity the thief was justified who when all his limbs were nailed to the cross had these two free with the to simplician on various q uestions 403 heart he believed unto righteousness and with the mouth he made confession unto salvation for this merit he was told im mediately to day thou shalt be with me in paradise good works would have followed if after receiving grace he had con tinued to live for a time among men they certainly did not precede so that he might have merited that grace for he had been crucified as a robber and from the cross was translated to paradise and as isaiah had prophesied except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed we had become as sodom and had been made like unto gomorrah had left us a seed in this passage is equivalent to a remnant shall be saved in the other for the rest perished as a due punishment being vessels of perdition that all did not perish as in sodom and gomorrah is due not to any merit of their own but to the grace of god that left a seed from which should spring another harvest throughout the whole earth so he writes a little later even so then at this present time a remnant is saved by the election of grace but if it is by grace it is no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace what then that which israel sought he did not obtain but the election obtained it and the rest were blinded rom 11 5 ff the vessels of mercy obtained it and the vessels of wrath were blinded yet all were of the same lump as in the fulness of the gentiles 20 there is a certain passage of scripture which is highly relevant to the matter we are dealing with and which wonder fully confirms what i have been urging it is in the book which some call jesus sirach and others ecclesiasticus there it is written all men are from the ground and adam was created of earth in the abundance of his discipline the lord separated them and changed their ways some of them he blessed and exalted some he sanctified and brought nigh to himself some of them he cursed and brought low and turned them to their dissensions as the clay is in the potter’s hand to form and fashion it and all his ways are according to his good pleasure so is man in the hand of him that made him and he will render to him according to his judgment good is set over against evil and life over against death so is the sinner over against the godly thus look upon all the works of the most high two and two one against another ecclesiasticus 33 10 ff first god’s discipline is commended in the abundance of his discipline god separated them from what if not from the blessedness of paradise and he changed their ways that they might now live as mortals then of all was formed one mass coming from augustine earlier writings 404 inherited sin and the penalty of mortality though god formed and created what was good in all there is form and the fitting together of the body in such concord of the members that the apostle can use it as an illustration of how charity is obtained in all the spirit of life vivifies the earthly members and man’s whole nature is wonderfully attuned as the soul rules and the body obeys but carnal concupiscence now reigns as a result of the penalty of sin and has thrown the whole human race into confusion making of it one lump in which the original guilt remains throughout and yet he goes on some of them he blessed and exalted some he sanctified and brought nigh to himself some he cursed and brought low and turned them to their dissensions he continues in words like those of the apostle has not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dis honour he has the same similitude as the clay is in the potter’s hand to form and to fashion it and all his ways are according to his good pleasure so is man in the hand of him that made him the apostle says surely there is no un righteousness with god sirach adds he will render unto him according to his judgment just punishments are allotted to the damned but even this is put to a good use for those learn from it who have obtained mercy as he says good is set over against evil and life over against death so is the sinner over against the godly so look upon all the works of the most high two and two one against the other the better stand out and learn from comparison with the worse now these better are made better by grace he hardly says that a remnant shall be saved but he goes on to speak as one of the remnant i awaked up last as one that gleaneth after the grape gatherers how does he prove that it was not for his own merits but by the mercy of god by the blessing of god i hoped and filled my wine press as one that gathereth grapes though it awaked last be cause as it is said the last shall be first a people hoping in the blessing of god gleaned from the remnant of israel and filled its winepress from the riches of the harvest which the whole earth produces 21 the apostle therefore and all those who have been justified and have demonstrated for us the understanding of grace have no other intention than to show that he that glories should glory in thfe lord who will call in question the works of the lord who out of one lump damns one and justifies an other free will is most important it exists indeed but of what to simpligian on various q uestions 405 value is it in those who are sold under sin the flesh says he lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh so that ye may not do the things that ye would gal 5 17 we are commanded to live righteously and the reward is set before us that we shall merit to live happily for ever but who can live righteously and do good works unless he has been justified by faith we are commanded to believe that we may receive the gift of the holy spirit and become able to do good works by love but who can believe unless he is reached by some calling by some testimony borne to the truth who has it in his power to have such a motive present to his mind that his will shall be influenced to believe who can welcome in his mind something which does not give him delight but who has it in his power to ensure that something that will delight him will turn up or that he will take delight in what turns up if those things delight us which serve our advancement towards god that is due not to our own whim or industry or meritorious works but to the inspiration of god and to the grace which he bestows he freely bestows upon us voluntary assent earnest effort and the power to perform works of fervent charity we are bidden to ask that we may receive to seek that we may find and to knock that it may be opened unto us is not our prayer sometimes tepid or rather cold does it not sometimes cease altogether so that we are not even grieved to notice this condition in us for if we are grieved that it should be so that is already a prayer what does this prove except that he who commands us to ask seek and knock himself gives us the will to obey it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that hath mercy we could neither will nor run unless he stirred us and put the motive power in us 22 if by the words a remnant according to the election of grace we are to understand not election of the justified to eternal life but election of those who are to be justified that kind of election is verily hidden and cannot be known by us who must regard all men as parts of one lump if however some are able to know it i confess my own weakness in this matter if i am allowed speculatively to examine such election of men to saving grace i have nothing to go by but the greater abilities of some or their relative freedom from sin or may i add if you please their honourable and profitable doctrines in that case the man would seem to be fit to be elected to grace who was snared and stained by the most trifling sins for who indeed has no sins or who had a keen mind or was cultivated 4o6 augustine earlier writings in the liberal arts but if i set up this standard of judgment he will deride me who has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the strong and the foolish things of the world to con found the wise looking to him i should be ashamed and being corrected i in turn would mock at many who are pure by com parison with some sinners and many who are cultivated orators by comparison with certain fishermen don’t we see that many of our faithful people walking in the way of god cannot be compared for ability i will not say with certain heretics but even with comic actors don’t we see some men and women living blamelessly in pure marriage who are either heretics or pagans or are so luke warm in the true faith and the true church that we marvel to see them surpassed not only in patience and temperance but also in faith hope and charity by harlots and actors who have been suddenly converted the only possible conclusion is that it is wills that are elected but the will itself can have no motive unless something presents itself to delight and stir the mind that this should happen is not in any man’s power what did saul will but to attack seize bind and slay christians what a fierce savage blind will was that yet he was thrown prostrate by one word from on high and a vision came to him whereby his mind and will were turned from their fierceness and set on the right way towards faith so that suddenly out of a marvellous persecutor of the gospel he was made a still more marvellous preacher of the gospel and yet what shall we say surely there is no unrighteousness with god who exacts punishment from whom he will and remits punishment to whom he will who never exacts what is not due and never remits what he might not exact ts there unrighteous ness with god god forbid why then does he deal thus with this man and thus with that man man who art thou if you do not have to pay what you owe you have something to be grateful for if you have to pay it you have no reason to com plain only let us believe if we cannot grasp it that he who made and fashioned the whole creation spiritual and cor poreal disposes of all things by number weight and measure but his judgments are inscrutable and his ways past finding out let us say halleluia and praise him together in song and let us not say what is this or why is that all things have been created each in its own time select bibliography the translation has been made from

treasure but it is an inheritance that must be reclaimed by each generation the library of christian classics is designed to present in the english language and in twenty six volumes of convenient size a selection of the most indispensable christian treatises written prior to the end of the sixteenth century the practice of giving circulation to writings selected for superior worth or special interest was adopted at the beginning of christian history the canonical scriptures were themselves a selection from a much wider literature in the patristic era there began to appear a class of works of compilation often designed for ready reference in controversy of the opinions of well reputed predecessors and in the middle ages many such works were produced these medieval anthologies actually preserve some noteworthy materials from works otherwise lost in modern times with the increasing inability even of those trained in universities and theological colleges to read latin and greek texts with ease and familiarity the translation of selected portions of earlier christian literature into modern languages has become more necessary than ever while the wide range of distinguished books written in vernaculars such as english makes selection there also needful the efforts that have been made to meet this need are too numerous to be noted here but none of these collections serves the purpose of the reader who desires a library of representative treatises spanning the christian centuries as a whole most of them embrace only the age of the church fathers and some of them have long been out of print a fresh translation of a work already 9 io general editors 3 preface translated may shed much new light upon its meaning this is true even of bible translations despite the work of

indexes 363 general introduction the monks always looked back to the apostolic church as the source of their way of life medieval monks supposed that their corporate societies were successors in a continuous line of that primitive group of disciples which possessed all things in com mon to support the texts of the acts they used a treatise of philo which described a group of contcmplatives contemporary with the apostolic age a group now believed to be jewish but then thought to be christian from philo's treatise st jerome deduced that the earliest members of the christian church lived in the way in which the monks of today try earnestly to live though a stronger sense of history discarded this faith it contained more truth than the nineteenth century suspected the little primitive church was puritan its moral standards were lofty its discipline rigorous its demands upon the faithful exacting the monks were the puritans of a church which in captuiing society had partially jettisoned its puritanism they were the successors of at least one facet an important facet of primitive christianity when in the first age christian evangelists preached the gospel to the gentiles they published the coming of the king dom the otherworldly and apocalyptic message which the gospel contained the circumstances in which they first preached the gospel naturally led them to seize upon those texts and those ideas which looked to another world they expected the end of the world soon the sense of detachment from the stuff of this mortal life was sometimes overwhelming st paul was not the only writer to use the imminent approach of the end as a ground for advising freedom from the cares of marriage the earnest waited for the end in continence prayer faith here and there this expectation of the end persisted for centuries and among the many in whom it became weaker the feeling of detachment and otherworldly expectation was 13 14 western asceticism maintained in other ways the government was hostile in the spasms of persecution the christian was in hourly danger from the mob or from arrest in the apocalypse we sec how the suffering of persecution and the awaiting of death were mingled with the expectation of the lord's second coming come yc out and be separate they believed the church to be a society set apart from and antagonistic to earthly society with its cruelty and immorality every martyr fortified this sense of antagonism the blood of the martyrs not only propagated the gospel it ensured that the kind of gospel propagatcxl was that which showed the christians as strangers and pilgrims upon earth that their life was in another and a heavenly zion the christian sources of the second century already show groups of virgins or ascetics in the christian congregations by the end of that century the existence of celibates was one of the first facts which enquiring pagans noticed when they examined the institutions of christianity in the new testament the demand for ascesis self discipline possessed many other aspects besides the advice about con tinence the cardinal demand from the sermon on the mount downwards was the demand for detachment and towards detachment it was believed that continence could bo a useful aid but already in the second century virginity was beginning to appear to be the act of asceticism par excellence the necessary foundation to the earnest and disciplined life many critics have found in the oriental depreciation of the body the source of this concentration upon a particular element in the detachment advocated in the gospel this view has been found to be an inadequate historical explanation it can hardly be doubted indeed that throughout the history of christian asceticism from the second to the filth century and beyond the eastern suspicion of the body and certain pagan concepts of ascesis did in divers times and divers persons reinforce an al ready existing trend it cannot be doubted that during the second century the christian leaders were forced to fight a strenuous battle against a lack of balance in ascesis groups which not all contemporary christians would have regarded as heretical exalted continence beyond the limits suggested by the new testament the apocryphal writings represent the level to which popular religion tended some gnostics and quasi gnostics cerdo and others exacted continence as a condition of membership marcion refused to baptize any married person who would not agree to dissolve his marriage general introduction 15 one saintly bishop who asked for abstinence from sexual union as a necessary element in christian living was criticized as rigoristic rather than heretical but a religion based upon the incarnation could not succumb to any theory that the body was evil theologians like irenaeus and justin martyr fought for the biblical doctrine of creation and incarnation when the struggle was passed the ascetic life was admitted to be an honourable earnest and devout way of serving the lord and the ideals of the ascetics had come to dominate the christian conceptions of holiness but marriage was also honourable the married christian could also in has different way serve the lord meanwhile the work of the congregations in the narrower sense of work needed to be performed the sick must be visited the widows shepherded prayers must be said alms must be distributed apocalyptic feeling and the sense of anta gonism to society prevented much idea that one could serve the lord effectively by the performance of a secular vocation some of the professions most useful to society like magistrates or schoolmasters were disliked by earnest christians because their functions were often entangled with pagan ritual serving the lord most naturally meant what the modern age has called church work it was patently true that if to serve the lord one must engage in a life of church work of prayer almsgiving and holy acts in the congregation then the married woman could not serve the lord like the virgin or widow and what was obviously true of females might be held to be true if less obviously of males these primitive ascetics possessed no more than the most rudimentary form of organization they were groups of persons who lived in continence distributed their goods for the benefit of the church and the poor kept particular hours of prayer they did not live in a community they retained their private means and were not sharers in a common purse they wore no special garb though if they appeared in elegant or fashionable clothes they were criticized by the beginning of the third century tertullian was acclaiming their numbers and all through that century the place of the ascetics in the con gregation was becoming more important and more honourable the ascetical idea of gospel holiness was sovereign in moral thought at the end of the century the virtue of continence has rarely received such panegyric as in the symposium of methodius in praise of virginity l6 western asceticism to transform these primitive ascetics into monks two develop ments were necessary i withdrawal from the congregation 2 common discipline and rule already in the third century the need for these developments was becoming urgent in tertullian the christians are described as numerous in origen they are to be found everywhere the church was becoming popular the ascetics slowly found that this popu larity forced them to seek some kind of retirement they were enabled to share the life of the primitive congregation without disrupting it and without interrupting their own rccollectcd ness because the primitive congregation was small ardent and puritan as the congregations swelled and the standards of morality and of worship were inevitably lowered the con trast between the ascetic groups and the normal congregation became more manifest and their relations more uncomfortable every difference in practice every extra form of worship widened the gap between the earnest and the rest the ascetics often joined in prayer at times like the third sixth and ninth hours when the normal working man could not bo expected to join with them and such customs though still extra liturgical were accustoming the ascetics to the idea of worshipping apart from the worship of the congregation as a whole perhaps social conditions exacted a certain withdrawal for women the con temporary standards of modesty separated them further from the everyday life of the congregation and since they could perform pastoral duties in the church less freely than men they naturally devoted themselves more to such work as intercession for which withdrawal was helpful we seem to find com munities for virgins accepted as normal before communities for male ascetics had become normal but already at the end of the third century and the beginning of the fourth there is evidence from syria and egypt of male societies these societies with their growing sense of separation from the congregation and increasingly distinct customs of worship were nevertheless engaged to some extent in the church work of the congregation the group about which we know most was probably syrian they had adopted their manner of life in pursuit of holiness they seem to have been withdrawn from any particular congregation but they worked zealously for the congregations around them they interceded for the ministers the sick and other needs they went round the villages preach ing praying reading the bible visiting orphans and widows and sick exorcising demons general introduction 17 one of the motives for withdrawal was the need for discipline even at the beginning of the third century we find cases of in discipline and error among the ascetics and a hundred years later the need for organizing communities under some strict rule was more obvious no satisfactory society could be achieved without a reasonable kind of discipline it was soon to be plain that a common discipline could only be achieved by sharing a common life and obeying a common rule we do not know enough of this intermediate stage whereby groups of ascetics in or round a congregation were becoming societies of ascetics separate from any congregation one corpus of writings though late in time does show how easily and naturally the change occurred the ascetical writings of st basil of caesarea in cappadocia probably composed at dif ferent periods between 357 and 378 by this time egypt had begotten those new ascetical ideas which were to influence so momentously the course of the movement st basil had once paid a short visit to egypt it is possible that he had been in fluenced a little by the new ideal of community life advocated in egypt by st pachomius but the ruling notion of most egyptians the superiority of the hermit life to community life ho rejected his work is best understood not as an off shoot of egyptian monasticism but as a continuation and exten sion of the idea of the primitive ascetic society his main teacher was no egyptian but eustathius of sebaste who was organizing ascetic groups in asia minor basil never used the technical terms of the new monasticism he thought of his societies as brotherhoods he demanded from them a com mon life in retirement from worldly life a retirement marked by a distinctive dress a stringent rule of obedience and com mon rules for eating fasting and mortification but though his groups were withdrawn from the normal congregation their quest for holiness issued in pastoral work for the congregation the society of ascetic brothers in caesarea ran his new hospital and leper settlement visited the sick educated children dis tributed relief there is an easy step from the ascetic groups of tertullian's day to the brothers of st basil they were groups existing essentially for the same purpose but in the later period brought together in a common life so that their pursuit of per fection should be unhindered by worldly distraction and placed under a stern rule of obedience to ensure the discipline and the training in holiness which a rightly administered rule provided we gain some clues to the transition period from the lives of l8 western asceticism the pious ladies in the city of rome under the direction of st jerome towards the end of the fourth century these ladies so long as they remained retired in rome for prayer and good works were the imitators of the virgins of the third and second century but the letters of st jerome also show how the now ideas and vocabulary of monasticism were turning the ascetics to that extra step of retirement which would change them into monks and nuns in egypt men began to take this new step not only with drawal from the ordinary ways of life but complete separation from the local congregation the example of a few individuals appears to have begun the movement into the desert the most celebrated of these st antony is known to us in the life by st athanasim written perhaps soon after antony's death in this document it is possible to sec how a young man became an ascetic of the nor mal kind and then passed further into the desert to inaugurate the new kind of life the solitary or monastic life antony was the son of rich parents who died when he was only eighteen or twenty years old and bequeathed him the property he heard in church the text if them wilt be per fect go sell all that thou hast and give to the poor and come follow me and thou shalt have treasure in heaven moved to obey the precept he placed his young sister in a society of virgins and began to live the ascetic life near his home after a time he studied under a holy man who lived in the next village and then visited other ascetics to be edified by them in particu lar ascetic practices or virtues so far there was nothing new or original antony had be come an ascetic in the same way as other men and women for more than a century but after a time he felt the need to with draw altogether from the neighbourhood of human beings he retreated to some tombs where he was locked m and remained inaccessible it is difficult to be certain of the reason athauaaim describes a succession of temptations by the devil the chief being the temptation to fornication the life describes his long battles with demons in the solitudes of the tombs of the deserts the second of the egyptian originators st pachomius came to frame his way of life through a similar series of progressive stages when a conscript in the army he was imprisoned with his group during a halt on a journey in order to prevent general introduction iq desertion the christians brought help to the prisoners and this experience seems to have converted pachomius to the christian life on release he retired to the village of schenesit began to lead an ascetic life helped the poor and sick of the village and the travellers who passed through finding that the crowd which resorted to him hindered his practice of holiness he retired to a senior ascetic palamon who lived a little way outside the village and put himself under his tutelage after a time he retired further to the abandoned village of tabennisi there he was joined by pupils and began to construct his system for the common life this community itself became progres sively withdrawn from the neighbouring villages at first the monks though they lived and worshipped together earned their livelihood by working in groups for the local farmers the splitting of the society for these labours encouraged indiscipline and later pachomius arranged that the work should be work for the society and not the work of casual employment in the lives of antony and pachomius we see how the ascetics were gradually moving further away mentally as well as geo graphically from the primitive ascetic in the congregation both began their ascetic life in a village both moved outside the village to join a senior ascetic rather more withdrawn and both then moved still further away in order to preserve their freedom in the pursuit of holiness there are many other in stances of such a progress and this gradualness is on the whole characteristic of the egyptian movement economically the in habitants of the solitudes could only survive if they were within reasonable distance of a market for their produce and a place to buy food the first stages were usually a society of monks gathered in a community outside a town or village but econ omically associated with it as the numbers of monks swelled rapidly the movement was always outwards away from towns and villages cells which earlier hermits inhabited with success later became unusable on the ground that they were now too near to civilization to explain the physical case with which the ascetic changed into a monk does not explain the religious ideas which the new way of life demanded as always in christian history there was interaction between doctrine and practice and it is never possible to determine precisely how far doctrine created the new way of life and how far the new way of life exacted a certain development in doctrine to account for it but it is possible to trace tentatively certain lines of doctrinal influence 5jo western asceticism in what does sanctity perfection holiness consist what fruits are expected of the holy man in the fourth century the christian reply to these questions was governed by the memory of the martyrs the early christians believed that they must imitate their lord in charity and self denial since the lord had consum mated his life on a cross the obedience even to death was an inevitable climax to the demand to take up the cross this obedience to death was no remote demand the persecutions forced many christians into the choice between death and apostasy in conditions of persecution the virtues to which the christians looked as supreme were the virtues demanded of the martyr faith capacity to bear suffering for christ's sake othcr worldliness and contempt for the goods of this world longing for heaven how near are these qualities to the qualities de manded of the monk two hundred years later may be scon from such a document as tcrtullian's exhortation to the martyrs tertullian was trying to encourage an imprisoned group in their expectation of death and the prison cell in tertulliari's eyes is extremely like the desert cell of the egyptian monk two hundred years later it is the place to which the martyr goes to trample the demons underfoot it is the place where the martyr can sever himself from the clutching tics of the world from his family and his friends the world rather than the cell is the true prison and out of it the martyr passes into the liberty of his confine ment the cell takes him from the stains of lust the temptations of pagan holidays and circuses the prison does for the christian what the desert did for the prophet let us drop the name of prison and call it a place of retirement though the body is shut in all doors are open to the spirit 9 and whatever is hard in their bodily circumstances is to be counted discipline like the athlete's training as the soul prepares itself for heaven long before the age of persecution was past the word martyr is applied to anyone who lives a truly self sacrificing life j tertullian could write of a martyrdom of will perfect without suffering cyprian of the martyrdom of virginity and it was natural for the ascetical writers of the later fourth century to use i e.g clement of alexandria stromateis 4 4 tertullian scorpiace 8 cyprian de habitu virginwn 21 and cf e e malone the monk and the martyr in antonius magnus eremita ed b steidle rome 1956 pp 201 it general introduction 21 the word martyrdom in these loose and general senses it was equally natural with this memory of persecution stamped upon the mind of the church that christians looked to find the especial virtues of the martyr in the man who obeyed the com mand to be perfect christian thinkers were beginning more and more to stress the personal and individual element in the idea of sanctity plainly sanctity can only exist in individuals though inseparable from the individual's behaviour to his fellows and perhaps from their behaviour to him the primitive congregations were little groups of the saints and sanctity was a sharing in the gift of the spirit which dwelt in the body of christ and in each member of it during the third and early fourth centuries the idea of sanctity was becoming less corporate and more individualistic this issued largely from the growth of the church from 313 the church was becoming ever more established and all embracing an established church which normally expects to contain the majority of the population is less conscious of its distinctivcncss its separation from the world it was easier for christians to feel their common christianity when anti christians were powerful and when congregations included men and women whose conduct was lax it was less natural to think of the inspiration of the spirit among all the members of the body than to think of the inspiration of certain individuals already before the monastic ideal was widely known the ascctical writers were beginning to be more individualistic in their emphasis here is a hymn sung by virgins about a.d 300 virgins a trump has sounded from heaven that wakes the dead bidding us all to meet the bridegroom in white robes and with torches towards the east arise before the king enters within the gates i keep myself pure for thee o bridegroom and holding a lighted torch i go to meet thee fleeing from the sorrowful happiness of mortals and des pising the luxuriant delights of life and its love i desire to be protected under thy life giving arms and to behold thy beauty for ever o blessed one i keep myself pure for thce o bridegroom and holding a lighted torch i go to meet thee i forget my own country o lord through desire of thy grace i forget also the company of virgins my fellows the desire even of mother and kindred for thou o christ art all things to me 22 western asceticism i keep myself pure for thee o bridegroom and holding a lighted torch i go to meet thee 2 all this is fully compatible with the christian doctrine of the church yet there is a running stream of feeling that the soul is so seeking its perfection face to face with god that everything except god and the soul sink into a secondary place the church was there to contain the ascetic group was there to encourage but in the last resort the soul must work out its own salvation with fear and trembling what was the hermit to do in his hermitage the answer for most was simple pray endure wait for the end so a hermit answered the enquiry of melania from dawn to three o'clock 1 pray and at the same time spin flax during the remaining hours i think upon the holy patriarchs prophets apostles and martyrs then after supper i spend my time patiently waiting for the end in cheerfulness and hope for many this was all that was necessary but others needed to provide more intel lectual analysis of the raison d'etre of their life we must beware of reading into the whole movement ideas which were mainly the food of an intelligent greek minority many sources besides the life of antony show the primary work of the hermit to be the fight with demons the cultivation of virtues the practice of fasting and mortification praying and reading the bible but among the educated groups of greek monks some thinkers began to construct a theological theory which would account satisfactorily for the nature and purpose and ascetical methods of the hermit life the greek monks adapted an already existing theology to serve the purposes of desert spirituality in the third century the school of alexandria led by clement and then origcu hud couched their moral and ascctical thought in terms partially borrowed from the vocabulary of greek philosophy the end of life was the vision of god the training of the body the con quest of sin the fight with the demons the practice of virtue were all destined to the one great end contemplation of god by pure mind this language utilized as it was by two pro found thinkers both of whom were deeply christian suited the needs of those monks who theorized upon the purpose of the solitary life and with certain adaptations educated monks iix egypt used this vocabulary and these ideas to explain their own practice they supplied the most sensitive discerning and sober 2 methodius symposium xi 2 tr ante nicene library general introduction 23 instruction to be found in the egyptian movement and their influence is to be seen everywhere even among those ascetics who came in time to resent it the spiritual ideal thus proffered may be seen at its wisest and noblest in the work of john cassian seven of whose conferences are translated in this volume it influenced many of the narrative sources like the lausiac history of palladius an illuminating account of the movement during its springtime of freshness and promise the object of the solitary's life was contemplation the un ceasing concentration upon god in prayer and the text pray without ceasing was given a new interpretation human society was distracting visitors diverted the mind hence physical solitude was a necessary condition for contemplation the kinds of work selected were those which enabled a monk to sit continuously in his cell and were mechanical and un distracting only the virtuous man who had conquered tempta tions could contemplate in purity of heart therefore they undertook the quest for virtue as a preparatory stage in the path to pure contemplation it will be observed that this theory was giving a new nuance to the christian doctrines of worship and perfection in the less intcllectualizcd tradition virtue was perfection and faithful prayer was part of the content of the virtuous life now the virtuous life is coming to be the preliminary for the highest form of prayer worship is becoming an act of the mind it is not always thought to be worship in the highest sense to live a good life in imitation of christ a life whose offering is focused in prayer and sacraments the living of the good life is now the necessary preparation for the highest form of worship by 375 the monks had already peopled the deserts round the nile valley monks living a common life in a community coenobium monks living in isolated cells but joining together for worship for buying and selling for a rudimentary form of discipline sightseers visiting the famous cells enquirers travel ling round the various societies seeking instruction and edi fication the dominant ideal through the land was the hermit ideal of the followers of st antony life in solitude needed more endurance offered more chance of mortification allowed the opportunity for ceaseless and undistracted contemplation with all its faults faults patent to any reader of the sources a man could find sanctity in the desert communities the ideal was appealing for utter renunciation of the self the appeal was answered in syria and asia minor ascetics had taken up the 24 western asceticism same ideals in rome and italy the ascetics were becoming interested in the new practices and new theories soon a copy of the life of antony was being read as far away as trfevcs in gaul there were also risks if the ascetics of the third century had begun to need discip line the solitaries of the desert incurred a still graver danger not everyone possessed the strength of antony the demons did not always lose their battle the loneliness of the solitary's life increased the chance of abnormality eccentricity even mad ness the admiration of visitors could turn weaker heads the man whose capital fault was pride or lust or gluttony did not find that he had cured himself by escaping from his friends and family the ordinary aids of the church the sacraments corporate worship were less accessible the solitary sometimes lacked wise guidance in ascesis and prayer the call to self denial could easily become the exaltation of suffering asaesis could become an end instead of a means the movement needed wise organization wise discipline wise instruction the leaders met this need by grouping the solitaries in loose organizations they prayed their offices at common hours they consulted each other on questions of ascesis and prayer they joined in corporate worship at the church of their group oh saturday and sunday they accepted as a necessary step on the road to holiness obedience to a senior monk or council of senior monks and it became the standard teaching of the autonian leaders that no one should be allowed to attempt the solitary life until he had served a long probation in a community this ban was sometimes defied it was difficult to restrain an ardent soul longing for what everyone told him was the higher ideal but on the whole the teaching was accepted a remmciaut might remain twenty years or more in a community before venturing to join a hermit grouj in the endeavour to learn the first steps in conquering self will by obeying a superior to train his patience and his charity by accepting the necessary frictions of common life to become disciplined in regular worship regular prayer regular reading or memorization of the bible and to have his spiritual development watched and guided by experi enced men the quest for discipline and sane guidance led some t junkers to reject the ideals of the solitaries altogether in upper egypt pachomius organized a row of monasteries on the principle of the common life and though there was a certain coming and goings these communities were not regarded as preparatory general introduction 25 schools for hermits but as houses where the individual might best fulfil the life of sanctity basil of cappadocia on the other hand knew the hermit spirituality and rejected its claim that the solitary life was the loftiest form of ascetic practice athanasius during his western exiles had introduced the news of the egyptian movement to the ascetics and religious leaders of rome and the west at least two latin translations of the life of antony were circulating by 379 the groups of ascetics and virgins in rome were soon hankering after ways of life more akin to the eastern pattern and from 386 a little group of latins under the leadership of st jerome was living in palestine and proclaiming the new form of the call to the ascetic life in spite of the contempt and the hostility which puritans usually have to face the movement quickly captured the minds of latin christian leaders the influence of augustine in africa and ambrose in milan was perhaps more akin to the old asceticism than the new monasticism in gaul st martin of tours who died in 397 set forth a life obviously adapted from egyptian models by 430 when augustine died the monastic ideals were sweeping all before them in every country of the west but spain where the ascetic leader priscillian became tinged with dualistic heresy in his language and brought a disaster and disrepute which temporarily slowed the rate of advance the capital of western monasticism in its first period of flourishing the fifth century was the coast of provence here the islands attracted numerous solitaries and communities wore founded like that of st honoratus who died in 429 on the island of lerins the main channel of egyptian influence upon these societies was john cassian cassian had spent a few years in a community at bethlehem and then ten years or more studying under the solitaries of egypt the accidents of exile brought him to marseilles where he founded a community of monks and another of nuns his writings the institutes and the conferences gave the west a sane and balanced view of the aims and ideals of the antonian movement and the greek theories of ascetical spirituality st benedict of nursia in central italy published his rule at some uncertain date between 510 and 580 the monastic ideal still commanded the allegiance of the most generous and 26 western asceticism self denying christians it was to command it for another five centuries or more but in benedict's time its practice was suffer ing and suffering from the old defect absence of discipline one reason was the rapid break up of western society and the inauguration of the barbarian kingdoms the stability of society as a whole usually assists the stability of monasteries and society was often anarchic the west had received the antouiun ideal as the highest ideal for the perfect it was true that st jerome had published a latin tianslation of the rule of st pachomius a translation which now seems to be the extant version nearest to the original it was true that rufinus had pub lished a latin translation with free alterations of the longer and shorter rules of st basil nevertheless latin monasteries looked to cassian and his tradition to supply them with rules as well as with spiritual advice benedict did not intend his communities to serve secular society the communities were retired from the world to work out their salvation in prayer and holy living any mcideiital effects that might accrue like the copying of manuscripts were as much outside benedict's purpose as they were outside that of the egyptians but the two weaknesses of the older monasticism sprang in part from this belief in the superiority of the hermit life for first this belief made discipline difficult to administer the expectation that a monk ought if he progressed favourably to move from community to hermitage made stability accidental rather than essential and without stability it was hard to organize a community effectively a second weakness arose as the obverse of the greatest strength of the egyptian tradition the antonians held before the eyes of the aspiring monk the supreme ideal of utter self denial and because they were exhorting to personal sacrifice they often talked as though they expected success this goal can be reached this renunciation achieved the reader of this volume will notice the moralism of the tiqyings of the fauwrs and of cassian's conferences will sec how naturally the monastic leaders exhorted their disciples to a human effort and how naturally they encouraged them by representing the goal as within reach the early ascetics did not deny that the grace of god must assist every stage in the christian life and one of the sanest of them cassian though an opponent of the augus tinian theories of grace had himself been influenced in his theology by st augustine but the practical eflect was moral exhortation after moral exhortation general introduction 27 the sensitive reader of the benedictine rule will perceive behind the impersonal regulations a quality in the author which penetrates his book the spirit of humility it is he feels not at all an advanced kind of rule it is a minimum a little rule for beginners in the spiritual life he knows that monks are called to a lofty ideal yet he also knows human nature its weaknesses as well as its potentialities benedict thought disobedience very wrong but he knew that monks are men and was not surprised that they arc sometimes disobedient he was prepared to face the possibility that the whole community shall have fallen into wrong putting the contrast in an exaggerated form in face of the lord's cry be ye perfect the egyptian replied you can do it and if you try god will give you the necessary help and benedict replied god help my weakness he put himself on a level with his own monks when he preached to his monks he was preaching to himself among them this humility and concern for the weakest of his brothers led him to put no emphasis upon the sterner varieties of ascesis or mortification he confessed that the rule did not intend to inflict anything rough or burdensome upon the monks the life was a hard life but it was no harder than the lot of the normal man who lived simply in that age for the person in need the sick the old and the young the abbot had full powers to relax the ordinary rules of moderate diet the ascesis which he recommended was spiritual the ascesis of obedience humility patience in the same spirit he expected monks to remain within com munities he recommended to his monks the reading of cassian and the lives of the desert fathers with all their stress on solitude as well as the rules of st basil with their condemnation of soli tude there is no word in the rule to condemn the solitary life he did not claim that the community life was the only satis factory form of the life of renunciation but the assumptions of the rule about stability and discipline make it plain that he expected his monks to continue in community until death and these assumptions about stability combined with the wise legislation and the ideals of abbatial government which he set forth to give the monastic organization a new strength and permanence the rule is remarkable for the strange kind of originality which it possesses benedict frankly took and adapted phrases of other writers chief of whom was cassian most of the rule is reminiscent of some of his monastic predecessors it now seems 28 western asceticism possible the debate among scholars is still proceeding that he took not merely phrases but many paragraphs from a rule existing before his time the regula magistrl but whether this is true or not nothing can affect the status of the rule as one of the classical documents of christian history in view of the later developments of benedictinism it is im portant to have some kind of picture of the community as he designed it its members were drawn from all classes of society they were nearly all laymen apart from the occasional priest who joined the community or the occasional monk ordained from the community in order to provide the sacraments they were governed by an abbot with an authority limited only by the portrait of the ideal and fatherly abbot contained in the rule and by the necessity for consulting the brethren before taking any decision each community was independent of every other community their daily life was thus organized there were variations between summer and winter and there is still some dispute about the exact meaning of certain details of the rule they rose very early usually about 2 a.m having had a reasonable period of eight hours sleep and celebrated the night office in church after an interval for the reading of scripture or for prayer they celebrated lauds at dawn and prime at sunrise between prime and dinner hold at noon or at 3 p.m according to the time of year they worked mainly in the fields or read books and went to church for the offices of tercc sext and none at the proper hours in the afternoon they worked and read again until vespers in summer they then had a light supper and just before dark attended church again for comp line after which they retired to bed it is probable that the division of the day allowing for differences in seasons amounted to three hours and a half for the office four hours and a half lor reading or meditation an hour for food eight hours and a half for sleep and six hours and a half for work in the fields the books to be read were cither the bible or books of spiritual reading there is no provision in the rule for works oflearniug for the reading of non christian authors for the copying of manuscripts the rule did not quickly win acceptance monks under the influence of traditional egyptian thought probably believed it to be lukewarm because it demanded so little physical morti fication the political troubles of italy prevented steady growth benedict had first practised the monastic life during a period of comparative stability the rule of the ostrogoths in italy but general introduction 2q in the second quarter of the sixth century the wars in italy were endemic and the new lombard invasions beginning in 568 ravaged and impoverished italy benedict's common life at monte cassino ended in flames some time before 590 when lombard raiders sacked the monastery the monks took refuge in rome and were installed in a house by the lateran church it is not certain when the discretion and moderation of the rule began to attract the common sense of the religious leaders in rome gregory the great who became pope in 590 had earlier founded a monastery in his house on the coelian hill and him self retired to it and it is possible that he utilized the rule of st benedict meanwhile there were rivals many rules used in this period arc still extant and there must have existed many more some houses in france and italy used variations or combinations of the rules recommended by basil or cassian on the whole the modified egyptian tradition was perpetuating itself and it received a new impetus from 590 with the landing of colum banus of ireland in france the sources do not allow more than an obscure knowledge of the way in which the monastic ideal passed into ireland it must have passed from gaul in the late fourth or early fifth century and it is possible the evidence is doubtful that st patrick was himself trained at l ins off the coast of provence and took with him to ireland the ideas of honoratus and cassian the reputation of martin of tours appears to have increased rapidly in ireland and in these ways the egyptian tradition was established there isolated from the continent the irish monks put their ideas in a way which can not be otherwise paralleled in the sphere of organization and discipline above all they accepted a stern standard of physical mortification when columbanus and his fellows landed in france they appeared men of iron to the franks and won from them that reverence which was so often given to physical self sacrifice for a time it looked as though the rule of columbanus would conquer frankish monasticism and when columbanus retired from france to found the house of bobbio in northern italy he began to exercise a powerful influence upon the italian ideas of ascetism during the seventh century the benedictine rule began to be adopted by some few monasteries in france monasteries had often drawn customs from various sources and at first they adopted the rule of benedict without excluding other customs some houses adopted a strange combination the rule of 30 western asceticism columbanus and the rule of benedict and though this joining of severe to gentle might seem a prodigy it was often the houses already under celtic influence who looked towards st benedict for the reason that the celts were interested in the roman see and the rule of st benedict was coming to be the rule peculiarly associated with the roman see gregory the great had in his dialogues a book of italian miracle stories which soon achieved an immense popularity aspired to show the world the person of st benedict and devoted to him and his miracles the whole of the second book as a result of the dialogues the rule which was already winning its way on its own merits was supported by the reputation of its author for sanctity meanwhile gregory and his successors had sot out to win the anglo saxons to the christian faith with the mission aries went the knowledge of benedict inism and during the seventh century english monasteries received the rule as part of the whole movement whereby england adopted christianity according to its roman methods of organization a century later anglo saxon missionaries were returning into fmncc and germany to reform and evangelize and it was this which finally secured the triumph of the rule in france from 817 the ob servance of the rule of st benedict was obligatory in every monastery of the frankish empire in a volume devoted to early western monasticism it may appear surprising that so great a bulk of translation is given to documents describing the teaching of the egyptian fathers many other documents might with reason have been suggested as classical in the monastic history of the early west if wo ask which were the chief documents to which the author of the rule looked back there were many the rule of puchomius the rules of st basil perhaps the rule of cacsarius perhaps some of the letters of st jerome perhaps the little hagiogniphies written by st jerome the life of st antony by athanasius in one of its latin versions but certainly one of the most important documents was the sayings of the fathers of the egyptian desert which were probably put into their earliest latin dress in the middle of the sixth century the greek is lost though there are numerous parallels in greek it is possible that st benedict did not know this collection and some scholars hold that the rule is earlier than this great latin collection of the hayings of the fathers i think it more probable that the author of general introduction 3 the rule knew this latin collection but whether he did or not he knew something of this kind and this latin docu ment translated in the sixth century effectively and authen tically represents the egyptian tradition in its influence upon latin monasticism its enchantment for latin monks and their moral ideals with whatever reserves this collection of the old greek apophthegmata must be used as a source for the history of egyptian monasticism in the fourth or early fifth centuries and in spite of these reserves the apophthegmata must remain one of the most significant and rewarding of all the sources since it contains so much of the raw material of history there can be no doubt of its power in the history of western spirituality secondly benedict used cassian more probably than any other author the conferences of cassian represent a tradition of spirituality of ascctical and moral thought for which benedict's rule was intended to provide a suitable and in benedict's eyes an elementary framework an endemic trial to all translators of early monastic docu ments is the problem of deciding how to translate abba i have translated it as abba in the sayings of the fathers and as abbot in the rule ofst benedict and in cassian as befits an inter mediary i have translated it as abba when i thought its primary sense was a title of honour for an individual elder and as abbot when i thought its primary sense was the head of a monastic community the numbers of the psalms in the text are the numbers as those authors knew them the numbers of the vulgate version the numbers of the psalms in the footnotes are the numbers of the authorized version the sayings of the fathers introduction from the middle of the fifth century and probably from the late fourth century 1 collections of sayings from the hermits of the egyptian desert began to be circulated smaller collections were gradually assembled into larger some of which were arranged in alphabetical order of the supposed speakers other collections appeared where the sayings were arranged more usefully and intelligently accord ing to the subject the known collections have different sayings apophthegmata as well as a different arrangement but often overlap sometimes with an obvious literary connexion some times dependent on two versions of an oral tradition sometimes a conscious extract from a translation or precis of a written source can be shown to have been inserted into the collection latin collections for example contain latin translations of a greek precis or translation of the known latin text of cassian the historical character and authenticity of the substance of these collections is undoubted in so great and haphazard a collection it was easy for a saying originating no one knew where to be put into the mouth of a famous speaker it was easy for later material for sermons or conferences which had grown a little out of the desire to edify to be incorporated but no one who knows the other sources for egyptian monastic history can doubt that these sayings are in the main the authen tic representatives of egyptian monastic spirituality in the fourth and fifth centuries this is the raw material of history here we find ourselves close to the men who founded the mon astic movement for we are not seeing the desert through the i cf socrates hist eccles iv 33 and cuthbert butler the lausiac history ofpalladius i p 3x1 33 34 western asceticism spectacles of an individual like cassian or jerome or palladius or sulpicius severus with a particular and unifying interest within the collection of apophthegmata different varieties of saying have been distinguished 2 the saying in its naked form is a delivery of the spirit filled man of the man endowed with particular gifts of wisdom and discernment from on high the young man goes lo the aged father and asks him speak to me a word that i may live the sentences are not only collections of moral and pro verbial sayings easy to memorize and therefore handed down as part of the lore of the desert tradition there was believed to be a prophetic quality about what was being said a quality dependent in part on moral experience and endeavour but not to be gained by human enquiry or the wisdom of the world it is the desert form of spiritual direction the tradition of the fathers which cassian was so anxious to set forth as the guide to the moral heights and the curb upon indiscretion individualism and eccentricity the hermit received his saying he medi tated upon it in his cell until he could put it into practice he took it to church at the end of the week exchanged such sayings with his brother hermits there and so the wisdom was handed on often taken out of its personal and particular context and transformed into a pronouncement of general truth and validity but other kinds of saying were interwoven with these moral pronouncements there are mere requests for help in making a decision where to build or how to spend a legacy puzzles about the interpretation of different texts of scripture or how to understand a virtue or a vice there are sayings which are not authentic mots of the desert but simply quotations from ai ascetic treatise or extracts from a sermon or summaries of edifying incidents in the life of a holy man anecdotes of the miraculous or of supernatural apparitions the material is often moralistic sententious platitudinous sometimes tiresome and sometimes trivial but it always pos sesses the purity of the best kind of simplicity the clear vision of an unimpeded moral integrity that earnest or smiling dis cernment which they cultivated as among the supremo virtues soon translations into other languages were circulating particularly into syriac coptic and latin our versions for these three collections date from an earlier period than any of the extant greek collections the most complete of these 2 of j c guy remarqucs sur ic texte des apqfihte mata pttirum in recherches de science religieu e 43 1955 252 8 the sayings of the fathers 35 latin collections is that of which a large part is here given in translation this collection was translated from a lost greek source as early as the middle of the sixth century probably by two roman clerics the deacon pelagius and the sub deacon john who may possibly as tradition suggested have been those who later became popes pelagius and john this collec tion was known almost certainly to st benedict when he wrote his rule for he appears to quote it and was the most influential of all the collections upon the history of monasticism in the west for western monasticism lost neither its memory of the origins of the newcomers in egypt nor its consciousness of the flowering of desert spirituality whether you read of peter damian and the italian revival of the eleventh century or of the origins of the great medieval orders like the cistercians or the carthusians the memory of egypt will be found to be among the sources of the ideas which were there proclaimed the standard and celebrated edition of this collection is that printed by the jesuit heribert rosweyde at antwerp in 1615 and at lyons in 1617 revised edition of 1628 rosweyde keeping to the pattern of early monastic collections which he had inherited from the later middle ages printed the collection as books v and vi of vitae patrum and this was reprinted by migne in patrologia latina vol 73 col 855 1022 though the work is thus divided into two books according to the probable latin translators and although there are manuscripts of the twelfth century troyes 716 bodleian douce 351 etc already with this division the collection is a single book and the divi sion is fortuitous i have therefore translated parts i xvii of rosweyde's edition of the sayings of the fathers the proper title found in most early manuscripts is adhortationes patrum but verba seniorum has become traditional and is appropriate i have translated this version partly because it seems to have been the earliest of the western collections partly because it forms a coherent group in the early history of western monasticism with cassian and benedict whose writings are also translated in this volume and partly because it was probably the most influential of the collections in western monastic history the translation of the sayings of the fathers has this difficulty rosweyde appears to have known only two manuscripts of first class importance and he was very cautious in his use of them i have therefore gone to the pre carolingian manu scripts to secure that the translation shall represent so far as is 36 western asceticism possible in the present state of knowledge the authentic text i have not attempted to provide a full apparatus but in the appendix will be found sufficient readings to offer some justi fication for the many passages where the translation is found to diverge significantly from rosweyde's text 3 the appendix is intended for use with rosweyde's text of translations much parallel material from the syriac was translated by e a wallis budge the paradise of the fathers 1904 a version the text of which is not negligible for the text history of the latin version charles kingsley tried his romantic hand in the hermits in the desert fathers 1936 miss helen waddell one of the most remarkable translators of our time gave an enchanting and incomparable english rendering of a select number of the sayings there is also an english incuna bulum which translated from the french many of these say ings a fine 1495 edition attributed to st jerome translated by william caxton who finished the translation on the last day of his life and printed at

thanks to the learned bollandist fr f halkin for advice upon this question the sayings of the fathers the text part of the progress of the fathers in perfection 1 someone asked abba antony what rules shall i keep to please god the old man replied keep my instructions and they are these wherever you go recollect god in your mind's eye whatever you do do it after the example of holy scripture and wherever you stay be in no hurry to move if you keep these three rules you will be safe 2 abba pambo asked abba antony what shall i do the old man replied trust not in your own righteousness be not penitent for a deed that is past and gone and keep your tongue and your belly under control 3 st gregory said god demands three things from a man who is baptized to hold the true faith with all his soul and strength to restrain his tongue to be chaste in body 4 abba evagrius said some of the fathers used to say that a dry and regular diet combined with charity will quickly bring the monk to the harbour where the storms of passion do not enter 5 the same said a certain monk was told that his father had died he said to the messenger stop blaspheming my father cannot die 6 abba macarius said to abba zacharias tell me what makes a monk he said is it not wrong that you should be asking me and abba macarius said to him i am sure i ought to ask of you my son zacharias i have one who urges me on to ask you zacharias said to him as far as i can tell father i think that whoever controls and forces himself to be content with necessities and nothing more that man is a monk 7 they used to say about abba theodore surnamed of 37 38 western asceticism pherme that he kept these three rules beyond many others poverty abstinence and running from the company of men 8 abba john the short said i would make up a man out of all the virtues rise at dawn every morning take the begin ning of each virtue and keep god's commandment in great patience fear long suffering in the love of god with a firm purpose of soul and body in deep humility in patience in trouble of heart and earnestness of practice in long prayer with sorrow of heart in purity of tongue and guard of the eyes in suffering injury without anger peaceful and not rendering evil for evil not looking out for the faults of others nor puffing up the self meekly subject to every creature renouncing material property and the things of the flesh in crucifixion struggle lowliness of spirit in good will and spiritual abstinence in fasting in penitence in weeping in the fight against evil wise and discreet in the judgement chaste in mind receiving good with tranquillity in working with your own hands in watching in the night in hunger and thirst in cold and nakedness in labours burying yourself in a tomb as though you were already dead and every day feeling that death is upon you 9 abba joseph of thebes said three things are honoured in the sight of god first when a man is weak and then temptations come upon him and yet he accepts them thank fully the second is when a man's every action is pure before god mixed with no human motive the third is when a man remains obedient to a spiritual father and renounces all his self will 10 abba cassian related this story of one abba john who ruled over a community because he was great ixi his way of life when he was dying cheerfully and with his mind set upon the lord his brothers stood around him and asked for a sentence which would sum the way to salvation and which he could bestow on them as a legacy by which they might mount to the perfection which is in christ with a sigh he said i never obeyed my own will and i never taught anyone to do anything which i did not first do myself 11 a brother asked an old man what thing is so good that i may do it and live by it and the old man said a god alone knows what is good yet i have heard that one of the fathers asked the great abba nesteros who was a friend of abba antony and said to him what good work shall i do and antony replied cannot all works please god equally 1 cassian institutes v 28 the sayings of the fathers 39 scripture says abraham was hospitable and god was with him and elijah loved quiet and god was with him and david was humble and god was with him so whatever you find your soul wills in following god's will do it and keep your heart 12 abba poemen said to keep guard to meditate on itself to judge with discernment these are the three functions of the soul 13 a brother asked him how ought we to live the old man replied we have seen the example of daniel they made no charge against him except that he rendered service to his god 14 the same old man said poverty tribulation and wise discernment these are the three parts of the hermit's life it is written that there were these three noah job and daniel noah is the type of those who own nothing job of those in tribulation daniel of those who judge wisely if a man has these three qualities god dwells in him 15 abba poemen said if a monk will hate two things he can be free of this world and a brother said what are they and the old man said bodily comfort and vain glory 1 6 they used to tell of abba pambo that in the hour of his death he said to the holy men standing round from the time that i came into this lonely place and built my cell and lived in it i do not remember having eaten anything which my hands had not worked for nor repenting of a word spoken until now and so i go to the lord as one who has ixot yet made a beginning of serving god 17 said abba sisois be despised put your self will behind your back be free of secular worries and you shall have rest 1 8 when abba chamc was dying he said to his sons do not live with heretics do not take notice of judges and let not your hands be open to acquire let them be stretched out to give 19 said a brother to an old man how does the fear of god come into the soul and the old man said if a man has humility and poverty and will not judge another then the fear of god comes into him 20 an old man said let fear and humility and want of food and lamentation abide in you 21 some of the old men used to say whatever you hate do it not to another if you hate being evil spoken to do not speak evil to another if you hate beiixg slandered do not slander another if you hate him who tries to make you des pised or wrongs you or takes away what is yours or any such 40 western asceticism thing do not do any such thing to him if a man can keep this saying it is enough for his salvation 22 an old man said this is the life of a monk work obedience meditation not to judge others not to speak evil not to murmur for it is written you who love god hate evil 2 this is the life of the monk not to go in with the unrighteous not to see evil not to be inquisitive not to be curious not to hear gossip not to use the hands for taking but for giving not to be proud in heart or wicked in thought not to fill the belly in everything to judge wisely that is where you find a monk 23 an old man said ask god to give you heartfelt grief and humility look ever on your sins and judge not another's be subject to all be not friends with a woman or a boy or a heretic be not confident control your tongue and belly and drink no wine if anyone speaks to you on a matter of con troversy do not argue with him if he speaks well say yes if he speaks ill say e l am ignorant in the matter but argue not with what he has said and then your mind will be at peace part ii of quiet 1 abba antony said fish die if they are long out of water so monks who dally long outside their cell or with men of the world lose their will to solitude as a fish can only live in the sea so we must run back to our cells perhaps if we dallied outside we might lose our inner guard 3 2 he also said the man who abides in solitude and is quiet is delivered from fighting three battles those of hearing speech and sight then he will have but one battle to fight the battle of the heart 3 when abba arsenius was still at the palace he prayed the lord saying lord show me the way to salvation and a voice came to him arsenius run from men and you shall be saved he went to become a monk and again prayed in the same words and he heard a voice saying arsenius be soli tary be silent be at rest these are the roots of a life without sin 4 once theophilus the archbishop of blessed memory came to abba arsenius with a judge and the archbishop wishing to 2 ps 97 10 3 gf vita antonii 85 the sayings of the fathers 41 hear him talk asked questions for a short time the old man was silent then he replied if i tell you anything will you obey it they promised they would obey it and the old man said to them wheresoever you hear of arsenius do not come nigh him another time the archbishop wanted to see him but first sent to see if he would open to him and arsenius sent a message to him saying if you come i will open to you but if i open to you i open to everyone and then i shall not abide here any more when the archbishop heard this he said if i go to persecute the holy man i shall go to him no more 5 once abba arsenius came to a place where was a bed of reeds and the reeds were shaken with the wind and the old man said to the brothers what is this rustling and they said it is the wind in the reeds the old man said to them truly if a man sits in silence and hears the cry of a bird he will no longer have the same quiet in his heart how much less can we attain quiet while we listen to the rustle of these reeds 6 they used to say about him that his cell was thirty two miles away and that he seldom left it and his needs were served by others when all the monks were driven from the place called scete he went out weeping and saying the world has lost rome and the monks have lost scete 7 once when abba arsenius was staying at canopus there came a virgin lady from rome to see him very rich and god fearing theophilus the archbishop received her she asked him to arrange with the old man for her to see him theophilus went to arsenius and asked saying a lady has come from rome and wants to see you the old man would not allow her to come to him when the lady heard of the refusal she ordered her beasts to be saddled and said i believe through god's help i shall sec him in my city of rome there are many inhabitants but i have come here to see prophets and when she reached the old man's cell by god's providence he was found outside it when the lady saw him she fell at his feet he helped her up indignantly and looking at her said if you want to see my face look close here it is but for shame she did not dare to lift her eyes to his face and the old man said to her have you not heard what i do a man's actions are what you should try to look at why have you dared to come all this way across the sea do you not know that you are a woman and ought not to go out at all or have you done it to go back to rome and say to the other women i have seen arsenius 42 western asceticism then you will turn the sea into a highroad for women coming to see me she said if god will that i return to rome i will not let any other woman come here but pray for me and ever remember me he replied cc i pray god that he will blot the memory of you from my heart when she heard that she went away troubled and when she came to alexandria she began in her sorrow to be ill of a fever and the archbishop was told that she was ill and came to comfort her and he asked her what was the matter she said i would i had never come here i said to the old man remember me and he said fi l pray god that your memory may be blotted from my heart and now i am dying of sorrow and the archbishop said to her do you not realize that you are a woman and the enemy uses women to attack holy men that is why the old man said what he said he prays for your soul all the time and so her mind was healed and she went away happily to her home 8 abba evagrius said cut out of your heart the desire for many things and so prevent the mind being disturbed and the quiet wasted 9 in scete a brother went to abba moses to ask a word and the old man said to him go and sit in your cell and your cell will teach you everything 10 said abba moses a man who avoids men is like a ripe grape a man who companies with men is like a sour grape 11 said abba nilus the arrows of the enemy cannot touch him who loves quiet but he who moves in a crowd will be often wounded 12 abba poemen said the beginning of evil is to spread the mind he said also it is good to fly from the things of the body when a man is engaged in conflict over the body ho is like a man standing on the very edge of a deep pool into which his enemy can knock him the moment he sees him but when he has put aside bodily things he is like a man standing a long way from the pool where if the enemy drags him along to throw him in god will help him while he is being dragged 13 once abraham the disciple of abba sisois said to him father you have grown old let us go into the world for a short time abba sisois said to him yes provided that we the sayings of the fathers 43 go where there are no women the disciple said but where is there a place without women except in the desert the old man said then take me to the desert 14 said the abbess matrona many people living secluded lives on the mountain have perished by living like people in the world it is better to live in a crowd and want to live a solitary life than to live a solitary life but all the time be longing for company 15 said an old man a monk ought to buy himself quie and so be able to despise any bodily expense which may happen 1 6 this story was told there were three friends earnest men who became monks one of them chose to make peace between men engaged in controversy as it is written blessed are the peace makers the second chose to visit the sick the third chose to be quiet in solitude then the first struggling with quarrelling opponents found that he could not heal everyone and worn out he came to the second who was ministering to the sick and found him flagging in spirit and unable to fulfil his purpose and the two agreed and went away to see the third who had become a hermit and told him their troubles and they asked him to tell them what progress he had made and he was silent for a little and poured water into a cup and he said look at the water and it was cloudy and alter a little he said again now look see how clear the water has become and when they leant over the water they saw their faces as in a glass and then he said to them so it is with the man who lives among men he does not see his own sins because of the turmoil but when he is at restj especially in the desert then he sees his sins part iii of compunction 1 it was said of abba arsenius that all his life whenever he worked with his hands he kept a handkerchief in his breast because tears fell so often from his eyes 2 a brother asked abba ammon saying speak to me a word the old man said to him go and meditate like the criminals in prison for they keep asking where is the judge and when will he come and because they await him they lament their punishment the monk ought always to be awaiting 44 western asceticism his trial and to chide his soul saying c woe is me how shall i stand before the judgement seat of christ how shall i give an account of my actions if you always meditate like this you will be saved 3 abba evagrius said while you sit in your cell draw in your mind and remember the day of your death and then you will see your body mortifying think on the loss feel the pain shrink from the vanity of the world outside be retiring and careful to keep your vow of quiet and you will not weaken remember the souls in hell meditate within on their condition the bitter silence and the moaning the fear and the strife the waiting and the pain without relief the tears that cannot cease to flow remember too the day of resurrection imagine god's terrible and awful judgement bring into your sight the con fusion of sinners before god and his christ before angels and archangels and powers and all the human race punishment everlasting fire the worm that never dies the darkness of tartarus and above them all the sound of the gnashing of teeth fearfulness and torments bring before your eyes the good laid up for the righteous their confidence before god the father and christ his son before angels and archangels and the powers and all the people the kingdom of heaven and its gifts joy and rest all this remember weep and lament for the judgement of sinners bring to life the grief they suffer be afraid that you are hurrying towards the same condemnation rejoice and exult at the good laid up for the righteous aim at enjoying the one and being far from the other do not forgot it whether you arc in your cell or abroad keep these memories in your mind and so cast out of it the sordid thoughts which harm you 4 said abba elias i fear three things the first the time just before my soul goes out from my body the second the time just before i meet god face to face the third the time just before he pronounces his sentence upon me 5 when archbishop theophilus of holy memory was dying he said abba arsenius you are a man blessed of god be cause you have always kept this moment before your eyes 6 there was a story that once when some brothers were eating together at a love feast one of the brothers at the table laughed when abba john saw it he wept and said what do you think that brother has in his heart that he laughed when he ought rather to weep because he is eating up charity the sayings of the fathers 45 7 abba jacob said like a lantern lighting a dark little room the fear of god comes into a man's heart and lightens it and teaches him all goodness and the commandments of god 8 some of the fathers asked abba macarius of egypt why is your body dry whether you eat or fast and the old man said to them a wooden poker in a man's hand which turns over and over the brushwood on the fire is itself being slowly burnt away so if a man cleanses his mind in the fear of god the fear of god also consumes his bones 9 once some old men of mount nitria sent to scete to ask abba macarius the great to come to them they sent a message that if he would not come to them the whole crowd of them would go to him since they wanted to see him before he passed on to the lord when macarius came to nitria the whole congregation assembled in his presence the elders asked him to speak a word to the brothers but he shed tears and said let us pray and weep my brothers before we go hence to the place where our tears consume our bodies and they all wept and fell on their faces saying father pray for us i o in egypt once abba poemen passed by and saw a woman sitting on a grave and weeping bitterly and he said if all the delights of this world should come they would not bring her soul out of sorrow even so the monk should ever be sorrowful within his heart 1 1 another time he went with abba anub to the country of diolcos coming among the tombs they saw a woman striking herself much and weeping bitterly they stopped and went to her and when they walked a little further they met a man and abba poemen asked him what is the matter with the woman yonder that she weeps so bitterly he said her husband is dead and her son and her brother and abba poemen said to abba anub i tell you that unless a man mortifies all his self will and possesses this grief he cannot be a monk the whole life and mind of that woman is wrapt up in grief 12 abba poemen said also grief is twofold it works good and it keeps out evil 13 a brother asked him what shall i do and he said when abraham entered the land of promise he built for him self a grave and bought the land as a burying place for his posterity and the brother said to him what burying place is meant and the old man said a place of weeping and sorrowing 46 western asceticism 14 athanasius of holy memory asked abba pambo to come down from the desert to alexandria when he arrived he saw a woman that was an actress and wept and the bystanders asked him why he wept and he said two things grieved me the first was her damnation the second that i take less trouble about pleasing god than she takes about pleasing the dregs of mankind 15 abba silvanus was sitting one day among the brethren and was seized into a rapture of mind and fell upon his face and after a while he rose up and lamented and the brothers asked him what is the matter father but he was silent and wept when they pressed him for an answer he said to them i was taken before the judgement seat and i saw many of our cloth going down to torment and many of the world going into the kingdom and the old man grieved and would not thereafter leave his cell and if he was forced to go out he covered his face with his shawl and said why should i have to see the light of this world wherein nothing is profitable 1 6 syncletice of holy memory said men endure sore travail and conflict when they are first converted to the lord but later they have joy unspeakable they arc like men trying to light a fire the smoke gets into their eyes their eyes begin to drop tears but they succeed in what they want it is written our god is a consuming fire 4 and so we must kindle the fire of god with tears and trouble 17 said abba hyperichius the wakeful monk toils night and day to pray continually but if he pierces his heart and lets tears drop that calls god down from heaven to have mercy 1 8 the brothers went to abba felix who had with himj some men othe world and asked him to give them a word but the old man said nothing when they went on asking he said to them do you want to hear a word they replied yes father so the old man said i have no word for you now when an elder is asked to speak and the brothers do what he tells them god gives the elder something to say but now there are brothers who ask for a word but do not obey the word they hear and then god takes away bis grace from the elder and he has nothing to say for he who gives it is not there when the brothers heard this they sighed and said pray for us father 19 it was said of abba hor and abba theodore that they were once putting a goatskin over a cell and then they said to hcb 12 29 the sayings of the fathers 47 each other if god visits us now what shall we do and sadly they left the place in a hurry and went away to their own cells 20 an old man told this story a brother wanted to become a monk and his mother forbade him but he did not rest from his purpose and said i want my soul to be saved she opposed him for a long time but when she found that she could not stop him she at last let him go he went away and became a monk but spent his life carelessly it happened that his mother died and a short time after he fell sick of a grievous illness and in an ecstasy of mind he found himself taken before the judgement seat and there he found his mother among the people being judged when she saw him she was aghast and said how is this my son are you condemned like me to this place what about the words you used to say i want my soul to be saved he was confused at her words and made stupid by his sorrow and stood without being able to say a word to her in reply but after this vision he was recovered by god's mercy from his dangerous illness and restored to health he meditated on god's purpose in visiting him he retired into himself cut himself off from all company considered his own salvation and lamented his earlier neglect in penitence his purpose was so fixed that many people asked him to spare himself a little for he might hurt himself by these immoderate lamentations but he would not be consoled and said if i was ashamed by my mother's taunts what sort of shame shall i have when christ and his holy angels look upon me in the day of judgement to condemn me 21 an old man said if the souls of men could die of fear at the coming of god after the resurrection all the world would perish of terror what shall it be to see the heavens opened and god revealed in wrath and fury and the innumerable com panies of angels gazing upon the whole human race gathered together therefore we ought to live our lives as men who must render an account of each action to god 22 a brother asked an old man why is my heart hard and i do not fear god the old man said to him i think that if a man has reproach in his heart he will possess fear the brother said to him what is reproach the old man said to reprove your soul in all things saying to it remember that you have to meet god say also to your soul what do i want with man i think that if anyone abides in these the fear 48 western asceticism 23 an old man saw a man laughing and said to him we have to render an account of our whole life before heaven and earth and you laugh 24 an old man said as the shadow goes everywhere with the body so we ought to carry penitence and lamentation with us wherever we go 25 a brother asked an old man abba speak to me a word the old man said to him when god struck egypt there was not a house that did not mourn 26 a brother asked another old man what must i do the old man said to him we ought ever to lament once one of the elders died and after several hours recovered consciousness we asked him what did you sec there abba and he told us with sorrow i heard there a voice of sadness saying over and over again c woe is me woe is me that is what we should ever be saying 27 a brother asked an old man i hear the old men weep ing and my soul longs for tears but they do not come and my soul is troubled and the elder said the children of israel entered the promised land after forty years in the wilderness tears are like the promised land if you have reached them already you will no longer be afraid of the conflict for thus god wills that the soul be afflicted that it may ever long to enter that country part iv of self control 1 some brothers from scete wanted to visit abba antony and embarked in a ship to go there in the ship they found an old man who also wanted to go to antony but they did not know him during the voyage they talked about the sayings of the fathers and the scriptures and then the work of their hands but the old man was silent through it all when they came to the landing place they saw that the old man also was preparing to go up to abba antony when they arrived abba antony said to them you found good company on your journey in this old man and he said to the old man you found good companions in these brothers the old man said yes they are good but their house has no door whoever wants goes into the stable and steals the donkey he said this because they uttered the first thing that came into their heads 2 abba daniel said of abba arsenius that he used to spend all night watching he would stay awake all night and about the sayings of the fathers 49 dawn when nature seemed to force him into sleep he would say to sleep come you wicked servant and he would snatch a little sleep still sitting and at once rose up 3 abba arsenius said an hour's sleep is enough for a monk that is if he is a fighter 4 abba daniel said of him all the years he stayed with us we gave him a little enough measure of food for the year and every time we came to visit him he shared it with us 5 he said also that he only changed the water for the palm leaves once a year otherwise he added to it he would make a plait of the palm leaves 5 and weave it till noon so the elders asked him why he would not change the water for the palm leaves which was stinking and he said to them when i was in the world i used incense and sweet smelling ointments so now i must profit from this stink 6 he also said this when he heard that all the apples were ripe he said bring them to me and he took one little mouthful of each kind giving thanks to god 7 they said of abba agatho that for three years he kept a pebble in his mouth to teach himself silence 8 once abba agatho was going a journey with his disciples and one of them found a tiny bag of green peas on the road and said to the old man father if you command i will take it the old man gazed at him in astonishment and said did you put it there the brother replied no and the old man said how is it that you want to take something which you did not put there 9 once an old man came to abba achillas and saw blood dripping from his mouth and he asked him what is the matter father and the old man said a brother came and spoke a word which grieved me yet i have been trying with all my might to nurse that grievance and i prayed god that he would take it away and the word turned into blood in my mouth look i have spat it out and am now at rest and have forgotten my grievance 10 once abba achillas came to the cell of abba isaiah in scete and found him eating he had put salt and water in his vessel seeing that he hid the vessel behind the plaits of palm leaves abba achillas said tell me what you were eating and he answered forgive me abba but i was cutting palms and began to be on fire with thirst and so i dipped a piece of bread in the salt and put it in my mouth but my mouth was 5 of gassian conferences xviii 15 50 western asceticism parched and i could not swallow the bread so i was forced to pour a little water on the salt and then i could swallow it but forgive me and abba achillas used to say come and see isaiah eating broth in scete if you want to eat broth go to egypt 1 1 they said of abba ammoi that though he was on a bed of sickness for several years he never relaxed his discipline and never went into the store cupboard at the back of his cell to see what he had many people brought him presents because he was sick but even when his disciple john went in and out he shut his eyes so as not to see what he was doing he knew what it means to be a faithful monk 12 abba benjamin who was presbyter in gcllia said that some brothers went to an old man in scete and wanted to give him a measure of oil but the old man said look there is the little vessel of oil which you brought three years ago it has stayed there where you put it and abba benjamin said when we heard it we marvelled at the old man's devotion 13 they told a story of abba dioscorus of namisias that his bread was made of barley and his gruel of lentils and every year he made one particular resolution not to meet anyone for a year or not to speak or not to taste cooked food or not to eat any fruit or not to eat vegetables this was his system in everything he made himself master of one thing and then started on another and so on each year 14 abba evagrius said that an old man said i cut away my fleshly pleasures to remove the opportunities of anger for i know that it is because of pleasure that i have to struggle with anger and trouble my mind and throw away my under standing 15 once epiphanius the bishop from cyprus sent a message to abba hilarion and asked him come that i may sec you before i die and when they had met and greeted each other part of a fowl was set before them the bishop took it and gave it to abba hilarion and the old man said to him forgive me father from the time i took my habit i have eaten nothing that has been killed and epiphanius said to him from the time i took my habit i have let none go to sleep who still had something against me and i have never gone to sleep with an enemy in the world and the old man said to him forgive me your devotion is greater than mine 1 6 they said of abba helladius that he lived twenty years wallis budge paradise ii no 76 p 18 the sayings of the fathers 51 in cellia and did not once lift his eyes upward to see the roof of the church 7 1 7 once abba zeno was walking in palestine and when he had finished his work he sat down to eat near a cucumber plant and his soul tried to persuade him saying pick one of those cucumbers for yourself and eat it what does it matter and he replied to his temptation thieves go down to tor ment test yourself then to see whether you can bear torment so he rose and stood in the sun for five days without drinking and dried himself in the heat and his soul so to say spoke to him i cannot bear torment so he said to his soul if you cannot bear torment do not steal to get a meal 18 abba theodore said the monk's body grows weak with eating little bread but another elder said it grows weaker with watching in the night 19 abba john the short said if a king wants to take a city whose citizens are hostile he first captures the food and water of the inhabitants of the city and when they are starving subdues them so it is with gluttony if a man is earnest in fasting and hunger the enemies which trouble his soul will grow weak 20 he also said as i was climbing up the road which leads to scete carrying plaits of palms i saw a camel driver who talked to me and annoyed me and i dropped what i was carrying and ran away 21 said abba isaac the presbyter of cellia i know a brother who was harvesting and wanted to eat an ear of wheat and he said to the owner of the field will you let me eat one ear and when he heard it he wondered and said the whole field is yours father why do you ask me 9 so scrupulous was that brother 22 one of the brothers asked abba isidore the priest of scete why are the demons so violently afraid of you and the old man said ever since i became a monk i have been trying not to let anger rise as far as my mouth 23 he said also that though he felt in his mind impulses towards the sins of concupiscence or anger he had not con sented to them for forty years 24 abba gassian 8 told a story of an abba john who went to 7 cf wallis budge paradise ii no 254 p 58 which attributes it to hor and cf paradise vol ii no 355 p 224 s institutes v 27 the apophthegmatist or his copyist has variations of detail so has sulpicius severus dialogues i 12 it looks probable 52 western asceticism see abba paesius who had lived for forty years in the deep desert and because he had much charity towards him he asked him with the confidence born of charity you have been isolated so long and cannot easily suffer any trouble from man tell me what progress have you made and he said from the time i began to be a solitary the sun has never seen me eating and abba john said to him nor me angry 25 he said also 9 abba moses told us what abba serapion said to him while i was still a lad i was staying with abba theonas and after each meal i was moved by some demon and stole one of the rolls of bread and secretly ate it theonas knowing nothing of the matter for some time i went on with this until the sin began to dominate my mind and i could not stop myself only my conscience judged me for i was ashamed to say anything to the old man but by god's mercy it happened that some visitors came to the old man in search of profit to their soul and they asked him about their own thoughts the old man replied nothing harms the monk so much and gives such happiness to the demons as when he conceals his thoughts from his fathers in the spirit and he also talked to them about self control and while he was speaking i thought to myself that god had revealed to him what i had done stricken in my heart i began to weep then i pulled the roll of bread out of my dress threw myself on the floor and begged forgiveness for what i had done and for prayer that i might be helped not to do it again then the old man said my son you are freed from your captivity though i have said nothing you are freed by your own confession the demon which by your silence you let dwell in your heart has been killed because you confessed your siix you let him rule you because you never said him nay never rebuked him henceforth he shall never make a home in you because you have thrown him out of doors into the open air the old man had not finished speaking when his words were visibly fulfilled something like a flame shot out of my breast and so filled the house with its stench that the people present that cassian's version is nearest to the primitive story the detailed dif ferences between the texts of cassian and verba seniorum are remarkable and may be accounted for only on the supposition that pelagius knew no text of cassian but was translating the unknown greek text taken by the apophthegmatist from a greek translation of cassian or more probably a greek epitome 9 conferences ii it the sayings of the fathers 53 thought it was burning sulphur and the old man said my son see the sign whereby the lord has proved that i have spoken truly and you are free 26 they said of abba macarius that if he was called among the brothers he made a rule for himself thus if wine could be had he used to drink it for the brothers sake and then for one cup of wine he would go without water for a whole day and the brothers wanting to refresh him used to give him wine and the old man took it with joy so as later to crucify himself but his disciple knowing the reason said to the brothers for god's sake i beg you do not give it him in the cell afterwards he tames himself with torments when the brothers knew it they gave him no more wine 27 abba macarius the great said to the brothers in scete after service in church flee my brothers and one of the brothers said to him father where have we to flee beyond this desert and he put his finger upon his lips and said i tell you this you must flee and so he entered his cell and shut the door and dwelt alone 28 abba macarius said also if when you want to reprove someone you are stirred to anger you are pandering to your own passion lose not yourself to save another 29 said abba poemen unless nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had come the temple of the lord would not have been burnt 10 and unless greed brought idleness into the soul the mind would not fail in its fight against the enemy 30 they said of abba poemen that when he was invited to eat and did not want to go he went weeping and praying that he might obey his brothers and not sadden them 31 they told abba poemen that a certain monk did not drink wine and he said to them wine is not for monks at all 3 1 a abbe poemen also said all rest of the body is an abomination to the lord 3 ib abba poemen also said the only way to humble the soul is by eating less bread 310 he also said that if a man remembered the word of scripture out of thy mouth thou shalt be justified and out of thy mouth shalt thou be condemned 11 he would more and more choose not to speak 3 id he also said that a monk asked abba pambo if it is 10 ii kings 25 8 9 11 matt is 37 the logion is attributed to alonius in budge paradfo qfihe fathers vol ii no 44 54 western asceticism good to praise your neighbour and he answered it is a greater good to hold your peace 3 ie a monk asked abba poemen how should i behave in my common life among the brothers the old man said to him he who lives among the brothers ought to regard them as though they were but one person and to keep guard over his mouth and eyes and so he will be able to win peace of mind 32 abba poemen also said they smoke out bees to steal away their honey and so idleness drives the fear of god from the soul and steals away good works 33 one of the old men told this story of abba poemen and his brothers who lived in egypt their mother wanted to see them and could not so she looked out for her chance and pre sented herself in front of them as they were going to church the moment they saw her they turned went to their cell and shut the door in her face but she stood at the door and screamed and besought them in her misery abba anub hearing her went to abba poemen and said what shall we do about the little old woman who is crying outside the door abba poemen rose up and went to the door and stood just inside and heard her beseeching them miserably and he said what are you screaming for old woman when she heard his voice she cried out the more and implored them i want to see you my sons why should i not see you am i not your mother have i not given you milk at the breast and now every hair of my head is grey when i hear your voice i am in distress the old man said to her do you want to see us in this world or the next she said to him if i do not see you in this world shall i sec you in the next my sons he said if you can suffer with a calm spirit not to see us here you shall sec us there 1 and so the woman went away happy and saying if i shall truly sec you there i do not want to see you here 34 they said of abba pior that he ate while walking about and when someone asked him why he ate in this manner he replied that he did it casually as if there were no need of it but when someone else asked the same question he replied so that my soul does not receive bodily pleasure from eating 35 they said of abba peter named pyonius who was in celua that he did not drink wine and when he grew old they a ked him to take a little wine when he refused they warmed some water and offered it to him and he said believe me my sons i drink it as though it was spiced wine and he declared that he was content with warm water the sayings of the fathers 55 36 once they celebrated a great service orvthe mountain of abba antony and a little wine was found there one of the elders took a small cup and carried it to abba sisois and gave it him and he drank it and a second time abba sisois received it and drank it and the elder offered it a third time but he did not receive it and said stay brother do you not know that satan still exists 37 a brother asked abba sisois what am i to do when i go to church out of charity the brothers often make me stay to the meal afterwards the old man said to him that is burdensome so abraham his disciple said to him if in the meeting at church on saturday and sunday a brother drinks three cups is it much and the old man said if there were no satan it would not be much 38 often the disciple used to say to abba sisois rise abba let us cat and he would say have we not eaten already my son and the disciple would reply no father the old man used to say if we have not eaten yet bring the food let us eat 39 abba sisois once said with confidence believe me for thirty years i have not been in the habit of praying to god about sin but when i pray i say this lord jesus christ protect me from my tongue 9 and even now it causes me to fall every day 40 once abba silvanus and his disciple zacharias came to a monastery and the monks made them sup a little before they went on their way and when they departed the disciple found a pool by the wayside and wanted to drink abba silvanus said zacharias today is a fast and zacharias said have we not already eaten today father the old man said to him to cat that meal was charity but as for us let us keep our fast my son 41 the holy syncletice said we who have chosen this holy way ought above all to keep chastity even among men of the world chastity is regarded but in the world they arc also stupid about it and sin with their other senses for they peep in decently and laugh immoderately 42 she said also animal's poison is cured by still stronger antidotes so fasting and prayer drive sordid temptation from the soul 43 she also said the pleasures of the wealthy world must not seduce you as if those pleasures were useful because of this 56 western asceticism pleasure they honour the art of cooking but by rigorous fasting you should trample on those pleasures never be sated with bread nor want wine 44 abba sisois said our form of pilgrimage is keeping the mouth shut 45 said abba hyperichius donkeys are terrified of lions so temptations to concupiscence are terrified of a proved monk 46 he also said fasting is the monk's rein over sin the man who stops fasting is like a stallion who lusts the moment he sees a mare 47 he also said when the monk's body is dried up with fasting it lifts his soul from the depths fasting dries up the channels down which worldly pleasures flow 48 he also said the chaste monk shall be honoured on earth and in heaven shall be crowned in the presence of the most highest 49 he also said the monk who cannot control his tongue when he is angry will not control his passions at other times 50 he also said let not thy mouth speak an evil word the vine does not bear thorns 51 he also said it is better to eat flesh and drink wine than to eat the flesh of the brothers by disparaging them 52 he also said the serpent murmured to eve and cast her out of paradise the man who rails against his neighbour is like the serpent he loses the soul of him that listens to him and he does not save his own 53 once there was a feast in scete and they gave a cup of wine to an old man he threw it down saying take that death away from me when the others who were eating with him saw this they also did not drink 54 aiiother time a vessel of wine was brought there from the first fruits of the vintage so that a cup of it could be given to each of the brothers and a brother came in and saw that they were drinking wine and fled up on a roof and the roof fell in and when they heard the noise they ran and found the brother lying half dead and they began to abuse him saying it has served you right for you were guilty of vainglory but an abba embraced him and said leave my son alone he has done a good work by the living lord this roof shall not be rebuilt in my time as a reminder to the world that a roof fell in scete because of a cup of wine 55 once a priest from scete went up to see the bishop of the sayings of the fathers 57 alexandria and when he came back to scete the brothers asked him how goes the city but he said to them believe me brethren i saw no man's face but the bishop alone and when they heard this they wondered and said what do you think has happened to all the population they hesitated to believe him but he cheered them by saying i have wrestled with my soul not to look upon the face of a man and so the brothers were edified and kept themselves from lifting up their eyes 56 once an old man came to another old man and the second said to his disciple make us a little lentil broth my son and he made it dip the bread in it for us and he dipped it and they went on with their godly discourse till noon next day then the old man said to his disciple make us a little lentil broth my son he replied i made it yesterday and so they rose and ate their food 57 an old man came to a father who cooked a few lentils and said let us worship god and eat afterwards one of them recited the whole psalter the other read and meditated upon two of the greater prophets and in the morning the old man went away and they forgot to eat their food 58 a brother felt hungry at dawn and struggled with his soul not to eat till 9 o'clock and when 9 o'clock came he extracted from himself a resolution to wait till noon at noon he dipped his bread and sat down to eat but then rose up again saying i will wait till three and at 3 o'clock he prayed and saw the devil's work going out of him like smoke and his hunger ceased 59 one of the old men was ill and for many days could not eat his disciple asked him to take something and restore his strength so the disciple went away and made some lentil cake a jar was hanging in the cell containing a little honey and there was another jar with evil smelling linseed oil only used for the lamp the brother took the wrong jar in error and put grease instead of honey into the mixture the old man tasted it and said nothing but quietly ate the mouthful the disciple forced him to take a second mouthful the old man tortured himself and ate it yet a third time the disciple pressed it upon him but he did not want to eat and said truly my son i cannot but his disciple encouraged him and said it is good abba look i keep you company when the disciple tasted it and saw what he had done he fell flat on his face and said alas father i have killed you and you have laid this sin upon me because you did not speak and the old man said to him 58 western asceticism be not sad my son if god had willed that i should eat honey you would have been given the honey to mix in those buns 60 they said of one old man that he sometimes longed to eat cucumber so he took it and hung it in front of him where he could see it and he was not conquered by his longing and did not eat it but tamed himself and did penitence that he wanted it at all 61 once a brother went to visit his sister who was ill in a nunnery she was a person full of faith she herself did not consent to see a man nor did she want to give her brother occasion to come into the midst of women so she commanded him thus go my brother pray for me for by christ's grace i shall see you in the kingdom of heaven 62 on a journey a monk met some nuns and when he saw them he turned aside off the road the abbess said to him if you had been a perfect monk you would not have looked so closely as to see that we were women 63 once some brothers went to alexandria invited by arch bishop theophilus to be present when after prayer he destroyed a pagan temple and while they were supping with the arch bishop they were served with veal and ate it without realizing it and the archbishop took a piece of meat and gave it to the old man who was reclining next to him and said look here is a good piece of meat eat it abba but they answered him till now we thought we were eating vegetables if this is meat we do not eat it and not one of them would take another mouthful 64 a brother brought some new bread to gellia and invited his elders to taste and when they had each eaten two rolls of bread they stopped but the brother knew how austere was their abstinence and humbly began to beg them for god's sake eat today until you are filled and they ate another two rolls see how these true and self disciplined monks ate much more than they needed for god's sake 65 once one of the old men lay gravely illj and was losing a lot of blood from his bowels and a brother brought him some dry fruit and made gruel and offered them to the old man and asked him eat perhaps it is good for you the old man looked at him for a long time and said in truth i tell you that i have wanted god to leave me in my sickness for thirty years more and in his weakness he absolutely refused to take even a little food so the brother took away what he had brought and returned to his cell the sayings of the fathers 59 66 another old man had lived in the desert for a long time and it happened that a brother came to him and found him sickening he washed his face and made a meal for him out of what he had brought and when the old man saw it he said truly brother i had forgotten that men found comfort in food and he offered him a cup of wine as well and when he saw it he wept saying i hoped i would never drink wine until i died 67 an old man made a resolution not to drink for forty days and if ever he thirsted he washed a vessel and filled it with water and hung it in front of his eyes and when the brothers asked him why he was doing this he replied so that if i do not taste what i long for and can see my devotion will be greater and i shall be granted a greater reward by the lord 68 on a journey one brother had with him his mother who had now grown old they came to a river and the old woman could not get across her son took off his cloak and wrapt it round his hands so as not to touch his mother's body and carried her across the river his mother said to him why did you wrap your hands like that my son he said because a woman's body is fire simply because i was touching you the memory of other women came into my soul 69 one of the fathers said that he knew a brother who fasted in his cell the whole of easter week and when at last he came to mass on saturday he ran away as soon as he had communi cated to prevent the other brothers forcing him to join in the dinner in the church in his own cell he only ate a few boiled beetroots with salt but without bread 70 at a meeting of the brothers in scete they were eating dates and one of them who was ill from excessive fasting brought up some phlegm in a fit of coughing and unintention ally it fell on another of the brothers this brother was tempted by an evil thought and driven to say be quiet and do not spit on me so to tame himself and restrain his own angry thought he picked up what had been spat and put it in his mouth and swallowed it and then he began to say to himself if you say to your brother what will sadden him you will have to eat what nauseates you party of lust i abba antony said i reckon that the body has a natural movement within itself which obeys the behest of the soul a go western asceticism kind of passionless movement of which the body's actions are but symptoms and there is a second movement in the body caused by eating and drinking whereby the blood is heated and excited that is why paul said be not drunk with wine where in is excess and again the lord commanded his disciples in the gospel see that your hearts be not overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness 12 and there is another movement which comes from the craft and envy of demons upon men who are striving to live a good life thus it is a help to know that there are three bodily movements from nature from plenty of food and from demons 2 abba gerontius of petra said many people who are tempted by bodily delights do not sin with the body but lust with the mind they keep their bodily virginity but lust in the soul it is good then my beloved to do what is written let everyone keep a close guard upon his heart 13 2 a abba john the short said the man who eats his fill or talks with a child has already lusted in his mind 3 abba cassian said 14 abba moses told us e lt is good not to hide the thoughts but to disclose them to discreet and devout old men but not to men who are old merely in years for many have found final despair instead of comfort by confessing to men whom they saw to be aged but who in fact were inexperi enced 4 there was once a brother exceeding careful about seeking goodness 15 and being sore troubled by the demon of lust he came to an old man and told him his thoughts the old man was inexperienced and when he heard he was indignant and said he was a wicked brother unworthy of his monk's habit because he conceived thoughts like that when the brother heard this he despaired of himself and left his cell and started on his way back to the world but by god's providence abba apollos met him and seeing him disturbed and melancholy he asked him son why arc you so sad the brother much embarrassed at first said not a word but when the old man pressed him to say what was happening to him he confessed and said it is because lustful thoughts trouble me i confessed them to that old man and he says 1 now have no hope of sal vation so i am desperate at myself and am on my way back 12 eph 5 18 luke 21 134 is prov 4 23 14 conferences ii 10 15 conferences ii 13 the sayings of the fathers 6l to the world when father apollos heard this he went on asking questions like a wise doctor and advised him thus do not be cast down son nor despair of yourself even at my age and experience of the spiritual life i am still sorely troubled by thoughts like yours do not fail at this point because this trouble cannot be cured by our efforts but only by god's mercy grant me what i ask just today and go back to your cell the brother obeyed him but abba apollos went away to the cell of the old man who had made him desperate he stood outside the cell and prayed the lord with tears and said lord who allowest men to be tempted for their good transfer the war which that brother is suffering to this old man let him learn by experience in his old age what many years have not taught him and so let him find out how to sympathize with people undergoing this kind of temptation and as soon as he ended his prayer he saw a negro standing by the cell firing arrows at the old man as though stricken he began to totter and lurch like a drunken man and when he could bear it no longer he came out of his cell and set out on the same road by which the young man started to return to the world abba apollos understood what had happened and met him he approached him and said where are you going and why are you so troubled within the old man seeing that the holy apollos understood what had happened was ashamed and said nothing but abba apollos said to him return to your cell and see your own weakness in another and keep your own heart for either you were ignorant of the devil in spite of your age or you were contemptuous and did not deserve to struggle for strength with the devil as all other men must but struggle is not the right word when you could not stand up to his attack for one day this has happened to you because of the young man he came to you because he was being attacked by the common enemy of us all you ought to have given him words of con solation to help him against the devil's attack but instead you drove him to despair you did not remember the wise man's saying whereby we are ordered to deliver the men who are drawn towards death and not forbear to redeem men ready to be killed you did not remember our saviour's parable you should not break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking flax not a single person could endure the enemy's clever attack nor quench nor control the leaping fire natural to the body unless god's grace preserved us in our weakness in all our prayers we should pray for his grace to save us so that he 62 western asceticism may turn aside the scourge aimed even at you for he makes a man to grieve and then lifts him up to salvation he strikes and his hand heals he humbles and exalts mortifies and enlivens leads to hell and brings back from hell 16 so saying abba apollos prayed again and at once the old man was freed from his inner war abba apollos urged him to ask god to give him the tongue of the learned to know the time when it is best to speak 5 when abba cyrus of alexandria was asked about the temptation of lust he said if you are not tempted you have no hope if you are not tempted it is because you are used to sinning the man who does not fight sin at the stage of tempta tion sins in his body and the man who sins in his body has no trouble from temptation 6 an old man asked a brother do you often talk with a woman and the brother said no and he went on my temptations come from painters old and new memories of mine which trouble me with their pictures of women but the old man said to him fear not the dead but flee the living flee from assenting to sin or committing sin and take a longer time over your prayers 7 abba mathois used to say that a brother came and de clared that the slanderer was worse than the fornicator and he replied this is a hard saying then the brother said to him how do you want to reckon the matter and the old man said slander is bad but it is curable quickly the slanderer can do penitence and say c i have spoken ill and it is over but lust is essential death 8 abba poemen said as a bodyguard is always standing by to protect the emperor so the soul ought ever to be ready for the demon of lust 9 a brother once came to abba poemen and said to him what am i to do father i am wretched with lust and i went to abba hybistion and he told me you ought not to let it dwell in you longer abba poemen said to him abba hybistion lives like the angels above and he knows not these things but you and i are in lust if the monk controls his stomach and his tongue and stays in solitude he can trust that he is not dying to they said of the abbess sarah that for thirteen years she was fiercely attacked by the demon of lust and she never prov 24 11 matt 112 20 i sam a 6 the sayings of the fathers 63 prayed that the battle should be stayed but she used to say only this lord grant me strength 11 they also said of her that the same demon of lust was once attacking her menacingly and tempting her with vain thought of the world but she kept fearing god in her soul and maintained the rigour of her fasting and once when she climbed up on the roof to pray the spirit of lust appeared to her in a bodily form and said to her you have beaten me sarah but she replied it is not i who have beaten you but my lord the christ 12 a brother was goaded by lust and the lust was like a fire burning day and night in his heart but he struggled on not coming to meet his temptation nor consenting to it and after a long time the goad left him annihilated by his per severance and at once light appeared in his heart 13 another brother was goaded by lust he rose up in the night and went to tell his temptations to an old man and the old man consoled him so he returned comforted to his cell but again the spirit of lust tempted him and a second time he went to the old man this happened several times the old man did not reproach him but spoke words to his profit yield not to the devil and guard your soul whenever the demon troubles you come to me and rebuke him and so he will go away nothing troubles the demon of lust more than disclosure of his pricks nothing pleases him more than the concealment of the temptation eleven times the brother went to the old man and blamed himself for his imaginings and then the brother said to the old man of thy charity abba speak to me a word the old man said to him believe me my son if god allowed the imaginings which goad me to be passed to you you would not bear them but would be utterly destroyed and so by his words and deep humility that brother found rest from the goad of lust 14 another brother was goaded by lust he began to struggle and prolong his fast and for fourteen years he guarded himself against temptation and did not consent afterwards he came to church and disclosed to the whole congregation what he was suffering and a decree was made and for a week they all afflicted themselves on his behalf praying god continually and so his goad was stayed 15 an old hermit said about the temptation to lust sloth do you want to be saved go and discipline yourself go seek 64 western asceticism and ye shall find watch knock and it shall be opened to you in the world there are boxers who are hard hit and yet stand firm and receive crowns sometimes one is set upon by two and their blows lend him strength so that he overcomes them have you seen what strength exercise brings do you also stand and be strong and the lord defeats your enemy for you 1 6 on this same temptation another old man said you should be like a man walking along the street past an inn and sniffing the smell of meat frying or roasting anyone who likes goes in and eats people who do not want it pass by and only sniff the smell so you ought to put the smell away from you rise and pray lord son of god help me do this against other temptations we cannot make temptations vanish but we can struggle against them 17 another old man said we suffer this through negli gence if we remember that god dwells in us we shall never bring into ourselves a vessel that is not his the lord christ abides in us and with us and watches our life and because we bear him with us and contemplate him we ought not to be negligent but ought to make ourselves holy as he is holy if we stand upon a rock the wicked one will be broken do not be afraid and he will do nothing against you and pray with courage this psalm they that trust in the lord arc like mount sion they that dwell in jerusalem shall stand fast for ever u 1 8 a brother asked an old man if a monk falls to sin he is punished like a person who has fallen from a higher state to a lower and is in travail until ho rises again but he who comes from the world is like a beginner advancing to a higher state and the old man replied a monk falling into temptation is like a collapsing house if he is a serious and sober person he rebuilds the ruined house he finds the right materials for build ing lays foundations and collects stone and sand and all the other needful things and so his building rapidly grows higher but the builder who did not dig or lay foundations and has none of the right materials goes away hoping that some day the house will be built so if the monk falls into temptation and turns to the lord he has the best equipment meditation on the law of god psalmody work with his hands prayer and the others foundations of his building the novice will find him self low down on the ladder of religion until he learns all these 125 1 the sayings of the fathers 65 19 a brother held in the grip of lust went to a great old man and asked him of your charity pray for me for i am troubled by lust the old man prayed to the lord and he came a second time to the old man and said the same and again the old man was careful to beseech the lord on his behalf and said lord show me why the devil is doing this work in that brother i prayed to you but he has not yet found rest and the lord revealed to him what was happening to that brother and he saw the brother sitting down and the spirit of lust near him and so to speak playing with him and an angel was standing near to help him and was frowning upon that brother because he did not throw himself upon god but took a pleasure in his thoughts and turned his mind towards them and the old man saw that the chief cause was in the brother himself and he said to him you are dallying with your thought and he taught him how to resist thoughts like this and the brother's soul revived under the old man's teaching and prayer and he found rest from his temptation 20 once the disciple of a great old man was tempted by lust when the old man saw him struggling he said do you want me to ask the lord to release you from your trouble but he said abba i see that although it is a painful struggle i am profiting from having to carry the burden but ask god in your prayers that he will give me long suffering to enable me to endure then his abba said to him now i know that you arc far advanced my son and beyond me 2 1 they said of an old man that he went down to scete taking his infant son with him the boy being brought up among the monks did not know what women were when he became a man the demons showed him visions of women at night and he told his father and he wondered and once they both went into egypt and saw women and the son said abba there are the people who came to me during the night in scete and his father said these are monks from the world my son they use one kind of dress and hermits another and the old man marvelled that the demons should show him visions of women in scete and they both went straight back to their cell 22 a brother was tested by temptation in scete and the enemy sent to his soul the memory of a fair woman and troubled him sorely and by god's providence it chanced that another brother came down from egypt and arrived in scete and when they met to talk he told him that his wife was dead she was the woman about whom he was being disturbed 66 western asceticism when he heard the news he put on his cloak in the night and went to the place where he had heard she was buried and he dug the place and wiped the blood of her corpse on his cloak and kept it in his cell when he returned and when it smelt too much he put it in front of him and hurriedly said to his temptation look this is what you desire you have it now fill yourself and so he chastised himself with the smell until his passions died down 23 a man once came to scete to become a monk and he brought with him his infant son who had been lately weaned when the child grew to be a young man the demons began to attack him and trouble him and he said to his father u i am going back to the world because i cannot bear these bodily passions his father comforted him but the youth said i cannot endure any longer father let me go back to the world his father said to him listen just this once to me my son take forty loaves and palm leaves for forty days and go to the inner desert and stay there forty days and god's will be done he obeyed his father and rose and went into the desert and remained there making plaits from the dry palm leaves and eating dry bread and after he had been there twenty days he saw the demon coming against him there stood before him a person like a negro woman ill smelling and ugly he could not bear her smell and thrust her from him and she said to him i am she who seems sweet in the hearts of men but be cause of your obedience and travail god has not let me seduce you but has shown you my ill favour he rose and thanked god and came to his father and said now 1 do not want to go to the world father i have seen the devil's work and his foulness but his father also knew what had happened and said if you had stayed there forty days and kept my com mand right to the end you would have seen still greater things 24 an old man was once living far out in the desert a woman of his kinsfolk wanted to see him after so many years and enquired where he was living and rose and came on the road to that desert and finding camel drivers she joined them and came with them into the desert for she was being drawn onward by the devil when she reached the old man's door she began to knock and say who she was i am your kin and she stayed with him but another monk was living nearer to egypt he filled his vessel with water at his supper time and suddenly the vessel was upset and the water spilt and by god's inspiration he the sayings of the fathers 67 said to himself i will go to the desert and tell the elders what happened to this water and he rose and went and at evening he slept in a heathen temple by the roadside and during the night he heard demons saying tonight we have driven yonder monk to lust and when he heard this he was sad dened and he came to the old man and found him sad and said to him what am i to do abba i filled my jug with water and at supper time it was spilt and the old man said to him you have come to ask me why your vessel was upset but what am i to do for last night i fell to lusting and he replied i knew it and the old man said how did you know and he said i was sleeping in a temple and i heard demons talking about you and the old man said look i am going to the world but he besought him do not go father stay here in your cell but send the woman away this has happened be cause the enemy attacked you when the old man heard this he endured and made his way of life more penitential and sorrowful until he returned to his earlier state 25 an old man said chastity is born of serenity and silence and secret meditation 26 a brother asked an old man if a man happens to fall into temptation what becomes of those who are led to stumble by it and the old man told this story in a monastery in egypt was a deacon and an official persecuted by a judge came with all his family to that monastery and by the devil's instigation that deacon came in to his wife and all the brothers were disturbed but he went away to an old man and told him what had happened now the old man had a secret inner room to his cell when the deacon saw this he said bury me alive here and tell no one and he hid in that inner room and there did true penitence but a long time after it happened that the nile failed to flood and when they were all making litanies it was revealed to one of those holy men that unless the deacon who had hidden with such and such a monk should return the water would not rise when they heard this they marvelled and they came and hurriedly brought him out of his hiding place and he prayed and the water rose and the men who had before been scandalized at him were now edified by his penitence and glorified god 27 two brothers went to a town to sell what they had made in the town they separated and one of them fell into fornication afterwards the other brother said let us go back 68 western asceticism to our cell brother but he replied i am not coming and the other asked him why brother and he replied be cause when you left me i met temptation and was guilty of fornication the other wanting to help him said it hap pened also to me after i left you i also fell into fornication let us go together and do penance with all our might and god will pardon us sinners when they returned to their cell they told the elders what had happened to them and were instructed what penance they should do but the one did penance not for himself but for the other as though he himself had sinned god seeing his earnestness and his charity disclosed to one of the elders a few days later that he had forgiven the fornicator because of the charity of the brother who had not sinned truly this was to lay down his soul for his brother 28 once a brother came to an old man and said my brother keeps leaving me and goes travelling everywhere and i am suffering for it and the old man besought him bear it calmly brother and god will see your earnestness and endur ance and will bring him back to you it is not possible for a man to be recalled from his purpose by harshness and severity demon cannot drive out demon you will bring him back to you better by kindness that is how god acts for our good and draws us to himself and he told him this story in the thebaid were two brothers and when one of them began to lust he said to the other 1 am going back to the world the other wept and said i am not letting you go away my brother to lose your toil and your chastity but he refused and said e l am not staying here i am going either come with me and i will return with you or let me go and let me remain in the world the brothers came and told this to a great old man and the old man said to hiitt go with him and because of your effort god will not let him perish so he rose and went with him to the world and when they came to a village god looked on the efforts of him who followed his brother out of charity and need and took away that brother's passion and he said to his brother let us go back to the desert my brother look i imagine that i have already sinned with a woman and what gain have i from that and they returned to their cell unharmed 29 a brother being tempted by a demon went to an old man and said those two monks over there who live together live wickedly but the old man knew that a demon was play ing with him and he sent and called them to him and at the sayings of the fathers 69 evening he put a mat for them and covered them with a single blanket and said they are sons of god and holy persons but he said to his disciple shut this slandering brother up in a cell by himself he is suffering from the passions of which he accuses them 30 a brother said to an old man what am i to do for these foul thoughts are killing me the old man said to him when a mother wants to wean her baby she smears something bitter on her breasts and when the infant comes as usual to suckle he tastes the bitterness and is repelled so you ought to put a bitterness into your thought the brother said to him what bitterness is this the old man said to him the thought of death and torment which is prepared in the next world for sinners 31 a brother asked an old man about thoughts of this kind and the old man said i have never been goaded by it and the brother was scandalized at him and went to a second old man and said look that old man said this to me and has scandalized me because it is unnatural the old man said to him the meaning of the words of that man of god is not upon the surface rise up go and be penitent to him and he will disclose to you the power in his words so the brother rose and came to the old man and was penitent to him and he said forgive me father that i was a fool and did not bid you goodbye when i left but i beg you explain to me how it is that you are untroubled by lust the old man said to him it is because ever since i became a monk i have never taken my fill of bread or water or sleep and because i am tormented by desire for food i cannot feel the pricks of lust and the brother went away taking profit from the words of the old man 32 a brother asked an old man what am i to do my mind is ever thinking about fornication arid lets me not rest even for an hour and my soul is suffering but the old man said to him when the demons sow thoughts in your heart and you feel this do not hold converse with your soul for that is the demons suggestion though the demons are careful to send in thoughts they do not force you it is yours to receive or reject do you know what the midianites did they adorned their daughters and set them where the israelites could see them yet they did not force them to intermingle but as each one wished but others were wrathful and uttered threats and avenged the act of whoredom with the death of those who had 7o western asceticism dared it this is what should be done with the lust that rises in the mind but the brother replied and what am i to do in that i am frail and this passion masters me and the old man said be earnest in this way when they start to speak in your heart do not answer them but rise up pray do penance and say son of god have mercy upon me but the brother said to him look abba i meditate and there is no penitence in my heart for i do not know the meaning of the words on which i meditate and the old man said yet go on meditating i have heard that abba poemen and other fathers said this the snake charmer knows not the meaning of his words but the snake hears them and knows their meaning and obeys the charmer and lies down so though we know not the meaning of what we say the demons hear and are fearful and flee 33 an old man used to say a lustful thought is brittle like papyrus if it is thrust into us and we do not accept it but cast it from us it is broken easily if it casts its sweetness over us and we dally with it it is as difficult to break as iron so we need a discrimination of mind to know that men who consent lose their hopes of salvation and for men who do not consent a crown is laid up 34 two brothers who were attacked by lust went away and married wives afterwards they said to each other what have we gained that we have ceased to live like angels and have come to impurity and later will come to fire and torment let us go back to the desert and do penance for our fault and they came to the desert and asked the fathers to accept them as penitents and confessed what they had done and the elders shut them up for a whole year and gave them each an equal measure of bread and water now they were alike in appear ance and at the end of the year's penance they came out and the fathers saw that one looked pale and melancholy the other looked strong and bright and they were astonished for each had had the same quantity of food and drink and they asked the man who was sad and troubled what were you doing with your thoughts in that cell and he said i was turning over in my mind the punishment i shall incur for the evil i have done and i was so afraid that my bones cleaved to my flesh and they asked the other what were you thinking about in your cell and he said i was thanking god that he had delivered me from the pollution of this world and the punishment of the next and has called me back to live here like the angels and as i thought continually upon my god i was the sayings of the fathers 71 glad and the old men said the penitence of both men is equal before god 35 in scete there was an old man who became gravely ill and was nursed by the brothers when the old man saw how much they did for him he said i am going to egypt and then i shall not be a trouble to these brothers and abba moses said to him don't go you will run into lust but the old man was vexed and said my body is dead how can you say that to me so he rose and went to egypt when the surrounding inhabitants in egypt heard that he had arrived they brought him many gifts and a devout maiden came to him wishing to minister to him because he was sick and after a short time he recovered somewhat from the illness which had gripped him and he came to her and she con ceived and when her neighbours asked her who was the father she said this old man but they did not believe hen then the old man said it is i who am the father keep for me the baby when it is born and when the baby had been weaned the old man carried it on his shoulders and arrived at scete on a feast day and went into church in front of the whole congregation when they saw him they wept and he said to the brothers do you see this baby he is the child of disobedience beware my brothers remember what i have done though i am old and pray for me and going to his cell he returned to his earlier way of life 36 a brother was grievously tempted by the demons of fornication four demons appeared before him like beautiful women and attacked him continuously for forty days but he fought like a man and was unconquered and god seeing his good struggle granted that he should no more suffer the sting of bodily passion 37 in lower egypt there was a very famous hermit who lived alone in his cell and it happened that by satan's wiles a harlot heard of him and said to the young men what will you give me if i ruin that hermit they agreed to give her a present at evening she went out and came to his cell like a person who had lost her way when she knocked at his door he came out and seeing her he was troubled and said how have you come here she pretended to weep and said i lost my way he felt truly sorry for her and led her into the little courtyard of his cell and himself went to the inner room of his cell and shut the door and she cried aloud in woe abba the beasts will eat me here again he was troubled and afraid of 72 western asceticism the judgement of god and he said why has god's wrath come upon me thus and he opened the door and brought her inside then the devil began to goad his heart to want her he knew that it was the devil's goading and said silently the ways of the enemy are darkness but the son of god is light he rose and lit the lamp and when he began to burn with desire he said people who do things like this go into torment test yourself and see whether you can bear a fire which is ever lasting and he put his finger in the flame of the lamp and he burnt it but he did not feel the pain because of the fire of passion within him and so until the dawn came he burnt his fingers one after the other the wretched woman saw what he was doing and in her fear lay still as a stone and at dawn the young men came to the monk and said did a woman come here yesterday evening he said yes she is asleep over there and they went in and found her dead and they said abba she is dead then he turned back the cloak which he was wearing and showed them his hands and said look what that child of the devil has done to me she has cost me every finger i possess and he told what had happened and said it is written render not evil for evil and he prayed and raised her up she was converted and lived chastely for the rest of her days 38 a brother was assailed by lust by chance he came to a village in egypt and saw the daughter of the heathen priest there and greatly loved her and he said to her father give her to be my wife he answered i cannot give her to you until i have besought my god and he went to the demon whom he served and said here is a monk wanting to marry my daughter do i give her to him the demon answered ask him if he denies his god and his baptism and his mon astic vow and the priest came and said to the monk if you deny your god and your baptism and your monastic vow i will give you my daughter the monk agreed and at once he saw something like a dove fly out of his mouth and up into the sky then the priest went to the demon and said he has promised to do the three things you said then the devil answered do not give your daughter to be his wife for his god has not left him but will yet help him and the priest went back and said to the monk i cannot give her to you because your god is still helping you and has not left you when the monk heard this he said in himself if god has the sayings of the fathers 73 shown me such kindness though like a wretch i have denied him and my baptism and my monastic vow if god is so good that he still helps me though i am wicked why am i running away from him and he was restored to his right and sober mind and came into the desert to a great old man and told him what had happened and the old man replied stay with me in this cave and fast for three weeks and i will pray god for you and the old man travailed on behalf of the brother and prayed god thus i beseech thee o lord grant me this soul and accept its penitence and god heard his prayer at the end of the first week the old man came to the brother and asked have you seen any thing and the brother replied yes i saw a dove above in the sky over my head and the old man answered look to your heart and pray god earnestly after the second week the old man came again to the brother and asked him have you seen anything and he replied i have seen a dove coming down by my head and the old man charged him pray and pray seriously and at the end of the third week the old man came again and asked him have you seen anything else and he answered i saw a dove and it came and sat on my head and i stretched out my hand to catch it and it entered my mouth and the older man thanked god and said to the brother look god has accepted your penitence in future be careful and on your guard and the brother answered see i will stay with you now until i die 39 one of the old men in the thebaid used to say that he was the son of a heathen priest and that as a little boy he had often seen his father go into the temple and sacrifice to the idol and once when he had crept in secretly he had seen satan on his throne and his host standing around and one of his chief tains came and adored him and the devil said where have you come from and he answered i was in such and such a province and there i stirred wars and riots and much blood was spilt and i have come to tell you and the devil asked him how long did it take you and he answered a month then the devil said did you take so long over it and ordered him to be beaten then a second came to adore him and the devil said to him where have you been and the demon replied i was in the sea and i raised storms and sunk ships and drowned many and have come to tell you and the devil said how long did 74 western asceticism it take you and he answered twenty days and the devil said why did you take so long over this one task and ordered him also to be flogged then a third came and adored him and the devil said to him where have you been and he answered i was in such and such a city and during a wedding i stirred up quarrelling until the parties came to bloody blows and in the end even the husband was killed and i have come to tell you and the devil said how long did it take you and he answered ten days the devil commanded him also to be flogged because he had been idle another came to adore him and he said where have you been and he answered i was in the desert and for forty years i have been attacking one monk and at last in the night i prevailed to make him lust when the devil heard this he rose and kissed him and taking off his own crown he put it on his head and made him sit with him on a throne and said you have been brave and done a great deed when i heard and saw this i said within myself great indeed is the discipline of the monks and so it pleased god to grant me salvation and i went out and became a holy monk 40 they said this of a father that he had been a man who lived in the world and had turned to god but was still goaded by desire for his wife and he told this to the fathers when they saw him to be a true labourer one who did more than his duty they laid on him a course of discipline which so weakened his body that he could not stand up by god's providence a father came to visit scctc and when he came to this man's cell he saw it open and he passed on surprised that no one came to meet him but then he thought that perhaps the brother inside was ill and returned and knocked on the door and after knocking he went in and found the monk gravely ill and he said what's the matter father and he told him i was living in the world and the enemy still troubles me because of my wife and i told the fathers and they laid upon me various burdens to discipline my life and in trying to carry them out obediently i have fallen ill and yet the goad is worse when the old man heard this he was vexed and said the fathers are powerful men and did well in laying these burdens upon you but if you will listen to me who am but a child in these matters stop all this discipline take a little food at the proper times recover your strength join in the worship of god for a little and turn your mind to the lord for this is a thing you the sayings of the fathers 75 cannot conquer by your own efforts the human body is like a coat if you treat it carefully it will last a long time if you neglect it it will fall into tatters the sick man did as he was told and in a few days the incitement to lust vanished 41 a very old hermit of saintly life lived on a mountain near antinoe and helped many people towards sanctity by his teaching and example so i have been told by well known monks and because he was saintly the devil was stirred to envy him as he envies all men of true goodness and the devil sent into his heart the thought that if he was really the man he wanted to be he ought not to let others minister to his needs but himself ought to be ministering to them or at least if he could not minister to the needs of others he ought to minister to his own needs so he said go to the town and sell the baskets you are making and buy what you need and come back to your cell and so be a burden to no one but the devil suggested this because he envied his quietness and his opportunity of leisure to hear god and the good which he did to so many people all round him the enemy was scurrying hurling at him trying to capture him he assented to what he believed a good thought and came down from his hermitage and everyone admired him and recognized him when they saw him but did not know that he was entangled in the devil's net and after a long time he saw a woman and because he was being careless he was overthrown and came to her and he went into a desert place with the devil at his heels and fell down by a river and he thought that the enemy rejoiced at his ruin and wanted to despair because he had sorely grieved the spirit of god and the holy angels and the venerable fathers many of whom had overcome the devil though they lived in towns and because he could not become like them he was utterly downcast and he forgot that god is a god who gives strength to them who devoutly turn to him blinded and not seeing how to cure his sin he wanted to throw himself in the river and fill the enemy's cup to over flowing in the agony of his soul his body began to sicken and unless god in his mercy had helped him he would have died impenitent to the perfect satisfaction of the enemy but at the last moment he found his right mind again he resolved to inflict a severe penance upon himself and pray to god in sorrow and grief and in this mind he went back to his cell he marked the door of his cell in the usual way to show 76 western asceticism that the man inside was dead and so he wept and prayed to god he fasted and watched and became thin with his aus terity and still he did not think he had made fit penance or satisfaction when the brothers came to him to be taught and knocked at the door he said that he could not open it i am bound by an oath to do penance for a whole year devoutly pray for me when they heard this they were scandalized because they believed him to be truly honourable and great but he found no means of explaining himself to them for a whole year he fasted rigidly and did penance on easter eve he took a new lamp and put it on a new pot and covered it with a lid at evening he stood up to pray and said merciful pitying lord who wiliest that barbarians be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth i flee to thcc the saviour of the faithful have mercy upon me that i moved thee to anger that i made the enemy happy here am i dead but obedient to thee thou lord who pitiest even the wicked even the pitiless thou who commanded us to show mercy to our neighbours have mercy upon me humbled before thee with thee nothing is impossible for in the mouth of hell my soul was scattered like dust have pity on thy creation because thou art kind and merciful thou who wilt on the day of the resurrection raise up even bodies that are not hear me o lord for my spirit has failed and my soul is wretched i have polluted my body and now i cannot live because i did not believe look at my penitence and forgive my sin a sin that was double because i despaired send life into me for i am contrite and light this lamp with thy fire so i may be enabled to receive confidence in thy mercy and pardon to keep thy commandments to re main in thy fear to serve thee more faithfully than before for the rest of the span of life which thou hast allotted to me on the night of easter eve he prayed thus and wept and he rose to see if the lamp were lit when he took off the lid he saw that it was unlit and again he fell on his face and besought god i know o god that when i struggled for my crown i did not stand on my feet but rather chose the pleasures of the body and so the punishment of the wicked spare me then lord here am i again i confess my disgrace to thee who art goodness and in the presence of thy angels and of all just men i would confess it to all mankind if i should not cause them thereby to stumble lord have mercy upon me and i will teach others lord send life into me when he had prayed three times god heard his prayer he the sayings of the fathers 77 rose up and found the lamp burning brightly and his heart leapt with hope and happiness and he worshipped god's grace who had thus forgiven his sins and answered his soul's prayer and he said i thank thee o lord that thou hast pitied me who am unworthy to live in this world and hast given me confidence by this great new sign of thy power thou art merciful to spare the souls which thou greatest he was still praying thus when the dawn came and forget ting his need for food he rejoiced in the lord all his life he kept that lamp alight pouring in oil from the top to prevent it going out and so once again god's spirit dwelt within him and he was famous among all the monks and showed humility and joy in his praise and thanksgiving to god a few days before his death it was revealed to him how he should pass to another life part vi that a monk should possess nothing 1 a brother was renouncing the world and in giving his goods to the poor he kept a little for his own support and he came to abba antony when the old man knew what he had done he said if you would be a monk go to the village yonder and buy some meat and hang it about your naked body and come back here and when the brother did so dogs and birds tore at his body he came back to the old man who asked him if he had done what he was told he showed st antony his torn body then said st antony people who renounce the world but want to keep their money are attacked like that by demons and torn in pieces 2 abba daniel told this story about abba arsenius an official once came bringing the will of a kinsman who was a senator and had left arsenius a very great bequest arsenius took the will into his hands and wanted to tear it up but the official fell at his feet and said please do not tear it the blame will be on my head and abba arsenius said to him i died before he did now that he is dead how can he make me his heir and he gave back the will and would accept nothing 3 once abba arsenius fell ill in scete and in his plight needed just one penny and he could not find one so he accepted it as alms from someone and said i thank thee o god that for thy name's sake thou hast made me worthy to come to this that i should have to ask for alms 78 western asceticism 4 they told this story of abba agatho he and his disciples spent a long time in building his cell after they had finished it he began to live there and in the first week he saw a vision harmful to himself and he said to his disciples what the lord said to his apostles rise let us go hence 18 but the disciples were exceedingly vexed and said if you meant the whole time to move from here why did we have to work so hard and spend so long in building you a cell people will begin to be scandalized at us and say look they are moving again they are restless and never settle but when he saw that they were afraid of what people would say he said although some may be scandalized there are others who will be edified and say blessed are they for they have moved their abode for god's sake and despised all their property yet i say to you whoever wants to come let him come because i at any rate am going they threw themselves on the ground before him and begged to be allowed to go with him 5 abba evagrius said that there was a brother who had no possessions but a gospel and sold it to feed the poor and he said a word which is worth remembering i have even sold the word which commands me to sell all and give to the poor 6 abba theodore surnamed pherme had three good books and going to abba macarius he said to him i have three good books and i am helped by reading them but other monks also want to read them and they are helped by them tell me what am i to do and the old man said reading books is good but possessing nothing is more than all when ho heard this he went away and sold the books and gave the money to the poor 7 one of the fathers told a story of john the persian how from manifold virtue he attained to a deep simplicity and innocence he dwelt in the part of arabia that lies near to egypt and once he borrowed from a monk a shilling and bought linen with which to make things and a brother came and asked him abba give me a little linen and i will make myself a vest to wear john gave it gladly then another came and asked him for a little linen so that he could make himself a coat and he gave it when many others came he gave it simply and with pleasure later the owner of the borrowed shilling arrived and asked for his money back and the old man said to him i will fetch it for you and when he could is john 14 31 19 cf socrates h.e iv 23 for the greek from evagrius practice the sayings of the fathers 79 not find the wherewithal to pay he went to abba jacob the steward and asked him for a shilling on the way he found a shilling lying on the ground he did not touch it but said a prayer and went back to his cell and again came the owner of the shilling and began to speak harshly to him for his money and john said i will give it back to you and again the old man went away and found the shilling lying as before on the ground and said a prayer and went back to his cell then the owner began again to be troublesome and the old man said wait for me just once more and i will bring you your shil ling and he rose and came to that place where he found the shilling on the ground he said a prayer and fetched it up and came to abba jacob and said abba on my way here i found this shilling on the ground of your charity make proclamation among the neighbours to see if anyone has lost it and the abba summoned them and announced the find but they could discover none who had lost it then john said to the abba jacob if no one has lost it give it to that monk there because i owe him a shilling and abba jacob was surprised that john being pressed to pay his debt had not at once picked the shil ling up when he found it and used it to pay there was another remarkable thing about abba john if anyone came to borrow something from him he did not take it in his own hands and lend it but said come in take what you need and when a borrower brought anything back john used to say put it back where you found it but if a man borrowed something and did not bring it back the old man said nothing about it to him 8 some of the fathers said that a monk once came to the congregation at cellia and appeared before abba isaac in a small hood and the old man rebuked him and said this is where monks live you are a man of the world and cannot stay here 9 abba isaac said to the brothers abba pambo and our fathers used to wear ancient and much patched clothes you wear expensive clothes go away you have abandoned this place when they were starting out for the harvest he said now i shall give you no more orders for you never obey me 10 abba cassian said 20 that one syncleticus renounced the world and divided his property among the poor but he kept some for his own use and was unwilling to accept either the poverty of those who renounced everything or the normal rule 20 institutes vii 19 8o western asceticism of monasteries basil of blessed memory said to him you have stopped being a senator but you have not become a monk n a brother said to abba pistamon what am i to do i find it painful to sell what i make abba pistamon replied abba sisois and others used to sell what they made there is no harm in this when you sell anything say straight out the price of the goods if you want to lower the price a little you may and so you will find rest the brother said i have enough for my needs from other sources do you think i need worry about making things to sell the old man answered however much you have do not stop making things do as much as you can provided that the soul is undisturbed 12 a brother asked abba serapion speak to me a word the old man said what can i say to you you have taken what belongs to widows and orphans and put it on your window ledge he saw that the window ledge was full of books 13 syncletice of blessed memory was asked is absolute poverty perfect goodness and she said it is a great good for those who can even those who cannot bear it find rest to their souls though they suffer bodily anxiety as sturdy clothes are laundered pure white by being turned and trodden under foot in water a sturdy soul is strengthened by freely accepting poverty 14 abba hyperichius said freely to accept poverty is the monk's treasury therefore my brother lay up treasure in heaven where there will be endless time for rest 15 one of the holy men named philagrius lived in jerusalem and laboured to earn himself enough to eat and when he was standing in the market square trying to sell what he had made by chance a bag fell on the ground near him containing a great many shillings the old man found it and stood there thinking the loser must soon come here and soon the man who had lost it came lamenting so philagrius took him apart and gave him back his bag the owner asked him to accept some of the shillings but the old man would have nothing then the owner began to shout and call come and see what the man of god has done but the old man fled away un perceived and went out of the town so that they should not know what he had done nor pay him honour 1 6 a brother asked an old man what must i do to be saved he took off his clothes and put a girdle about his loins and stretched out his hands and said thus ought the monk to the sayings of the fathers 8l be naked of everything worldly and crucify himself against temptation and the world's struggles 17 someone asked an old man to accept money for his future needs but he refused because the produce of his labour was enough for him but when the man persisted and begged him to take it for the needs of the poor the old man replied my disgrace is twofold i do not need yet i accept and i give to others and so will suffer from vanity 1 8 some greeks once came to give alms in the city of ostracine and they sought out the stewards of the church to show them who was most in need the stewards led them to a leper to whom they gave money but he did not want it and said look i have a few palm leaves to work and i make plaits of them and so get enough to eat then the stewards led them to the house of a widow who lived with her daughters when they knocked on the door one of the daughters ran to open it though she was naked her mother had gone out to work as a laundress they gave the daughter clothing and money but she refused to accept it and said that her mother had told her trust in god's will today i have found work to supply us with a livelihood and when the mother came back they asked her to accept it but she refused saying i have my god to care for me do you want to take him away from me today they perceived her faith and glorified god 19 a great man came from far to scete carrying gold and he asked the presbyter of the desert to distribute it among the brothers but the presbyter said to him the brothers do not need it and he was very pressing and would not give way and put a basket of money in the church porch and the presbyter said whoever is in need may take money from it no one touched it some did not even look at it and the old man said god has accepted your offering to him go away and give it to the poor and he went away much edified 20 someone brought an old man money and said take this to spend for you are old and ill he was a leper but the old man replied are you coming to take me away from him who has fed me for sixty years i have been infirm the whole of that time and have needed nothing because god has fed me and given me what i need and he refused to accept it 21 the old men told of a working gardener who gave away all his profit in alms and kept for himself only enough to live on but later satan enticed his heart and said store up a little money as a provision to spend when you are old and infirm 82 western asceticism and he made a store of coins in a big pot it happened that he fell ill and his foot became gangrenous and he spent all his coins on doctors but grew no better and an experienced doctor told him unless you amputate your foot the gangrene will spread through your whole body and they decided to amputate but the night before the operation he recovered his right mind and did penance for what he had done and groaned and wept saying lord remember my earlier good works when i worked in the garden and ministered to the poor 9 and when he said this an angel of the lord stood before him and said where is your store of coins where is your hope in them gone 55 then he understood and said i have sinned lord forgive me i will not do it again then the angel touched his foot and it was healed at once and he rose at dawn and went to the field to work and at the appointed time the surgeon came with his instruments to amputate the foot and people told him he went out at dawn to work in the fields 5 then the doctor astonished went out to the field where he was working and he saw him digging and glorified god that he had restored his health 22 a brother asked an old man would you have me save two shillings for myself in case i fall ill the old man seeing into his heart that he wanted to save them said yes 5 and the brother went into his cell and was worn down by his thoughts saying to himself do you think the old man spoke the truth to me or not he got up and went back to the old man did penance and asked for the lord's sake speak the truth to me for i am troubled in my thoughts about those two shillings the old man said to him i told you to save them because i saw you intended to save them but it is not good to save more than the body needs if you keep two shillings you will put your hope in them and if by chance they are des stroyed god is then no longer thinking of our needs let us cast our thought upon the lord it is for him to care for us 1 part vii of patience or fortitude i once when the holy abba antony was living in the desert his soul was troubled by boredom and irritation and he said to god lord i want to be made whole and my thoughts do not let me what am i to do in this trouble how shall i be made whole and rising up after a little while he began to go the sayings of the fathers 83 outside and he saw someone like himself sitting down and at work then standing up to pray then sitting down again to make a plait of palm leaves and again standing up to pray it was an angel of the lord sent to correct antony and make him careful and he heard the voice of the angel saying do this and you will be made whole when he heard it he was very glad and recovered his confidence and he did what the angel had done and found the salvation which he was seeking 2 a brother asked abba agatho i have been instructed to go somewhere and i have a grievous struggle in the place where i have been told to go i want to obey the order yet i am frightened of the inner struggle which will ensue the old man said agatho was like that he obeyed orders and so won the battle 3 abba ammonas said that for fourteen years he had prayed god in scete night and day to give him power to control his temper 4 abba bessarion said that for forty nights he had stood up among the thorns and had not slept 5 a hermit who was troubled in mind went to abba theo dore of pherme and told him so the old man said to him go make your mind humble put yourself in subjection and go to live with others so he went to a mountain and there lived with a community later he returned to the old man and said not even when i lived with other men did i find rest and the old man said to him if you are not at rest when a hermit nor when in community why did you want to be a monk was it not that you might suffer tell me how many years have you been a monk and he said eight and the old man said believe me i have been a monk for seventy years and i have not been able to get a single day's peace and do you want to have peace after eight years 6 a brother asked abba theodore if you suddenly hear the sound of falling masonry are you frightened abba and the old man said if the heaven fell down on the earth theodore would not be afraid for he had prayed to god that fear might be taken from him and that was why the brother asked him 7 they said of abba theodore and abba lucius from the region of alexandria that they lived fifty years enticing their souls onwards thus they said when this winter is past we will move from here and in the summer time they said at the end of the summer let us move from here and so those memorable fathers lived their whole lives in devotion 84 western asceticism 8 abba poemen said of abba john the short that he prayed the lord to take away his passions and so he was made tranquil in heart and came to an old man and said i find that i am at rest with no war of flesh and spirit and the old man said to him go ask the lord to stir a new war in you fight ing is good for the soul and when the war revived in him he no longer prayed for it to be taken away but said lord grant me long suffering to endure this war 9 abba macarius the great came to abba antony on the mountain and when he knocked at the door antony went out to him and said who are you and he said i am mac arius and antony went in and shut the door and left macarius outside and afterwards when he saw how patiently he waited he opened the door to him and he welcomed him saying i have heard of you and for a long time i have wanted to see you and he was hospitable to him and refreshed him for macarius was tired with his endeavours in the evening abba antony put out a few palm leaves for himself and abba macarius said to him give me some so that i can work at them antony said i have no more so he made a pile of what he had and they sat late talking to the profit of their souls and made a plaited rope and the rope hung out of the window in the cave and at dawn antony went in and saw the plaits which abba macarius had made and he wondered at them and kissed his hand saying there is much virtue in those plaits 10 this macarius once went down from scete to a place named terenuthis and he climbed into an old pagan cemetery to sleep and he put one of the bodies under his head as a pillow the demons hated him when they saw his assurance and tried to frighten him by calling out lady come with us to bathe and another demon answered from underneath macarius as though he were the dead woman i have a pil grim on top of me and cannot move the old man was not frightened but confidently thumped the body saying get up go if you can when the demons heard it they cried with a loud voice and said you have beaten us and they fled in con fusion n abba mathois said i want to find some easy but con tinual work rather than a heavy work that is quickly finished 12 they said of abba milidus that while he was living on the frontiers of persia with two disciples two sons of the emperor came on their usual hunting expedition and put nets the sayings of the fathers 85 over an area of forty miles and speared whatever they trapped and they found the old man and his disciples within the area and when they saw his hairy and forbidding face they were surprised and said are you a man or a spirit and he said i am a sinful man and i have come out here to lament my sins and i worship jesus christ the son of the living god they said to him there is no god but the sun and the fire and the water worship them and sacrifice to them and he replied you are wrong these are but creatures i beseech you be converted recognize the true god who made these and all things else but they mocked him and said are you saying that the true god is a condemned and crucified man yes said milidus i say that the true god is he who crucified sin and killed death so they tortured him and his two monks to force them to sacrifice and after much torture they beheaded the two monks but they went on torturing the old man day after day but afterwards they fastened him in one place and fired arrows into him one in front and one behind so that he looked like a signpost the old man said to them since you have con spired to shed innocent blood tomorrow at this very moment of the day your mother shall be bereaved of her children and your affection for her and you will spill each other's blood by your own arrows they thought his words were silly and next day went out again to hunt it happened that a stag escaped from their net and they jumped on their horses and chased him and each fired an arrow which hit the heart of the other and so they died as the old man had foretold 13 abba poemen said the mark of the true monk only appears under temptation 14 another saying of his was this isidore the presbyter in scete once addressed a congregation of monks and said my brothers is not work the reason why we are here and now i see that there is no work here so i am taking my cloak and going where there is work and there i shall find rest 15 saint syncletice said if you live in a monastic com munity do not wander from place to place if you do it will harm you if a hen stops sitting on the eggs she will hatch no chickens and the monk or nun who moves from place to place grows cold and dead in faith 1 6 she also said when the devil does not use the goads of poverty to tempt he uses wealth for the purpose when he cannot win by scorn and mockery he tries praise and flattery 86 western asceticism if he cannot win by providing health he tries illness if he can not win by comfort he tries to ruin the soul by vexations which lead a person to act against the monastic vow he inflicts severe sicknesses on people whom he wants to tempt and so makes them weak and thereby shakes the charity which they feel towards god but although the body is shattered and running high temperatures and thirsting unbearably yet you who endure all this are a sinner and remember the punishments of the next world and the everlasting fire and the torments of the judge ment so you will not fail in the sufferings of this present time indeed you should rejoice because god has visited you keep saying the famous text the lord hath chastened and corrected me but he hath not given me over unto death 21 iron is cleaned of rust by fire if you are righteous and suffer you grow to a yet higher sanctity gold is tested by fire a messenger from satan is given to you to be a thorn in your flesh lift up your heart for you see that you have received a gift like that of st paul if you suffer from fever and cold remember the text of scripture we went through fire and water and then thou broughtest us out into a place of rest if you have won the suffering you may expect the place of rest provided you are following what is good cry aloud the prophet's words i am poor and destitute and in misery for threefold suffering like this shall make you perfect he said also thou hast set me at liberty when i was in trouble 22 thus let us test our souls by this kind of self discipline for we have our enemy before our eyes 17 saint syncletice also said if you are troubled by illness do not be melancholy even if you are so ill that you cannot stand to pray or use your voice to say psalms we need these tribulations to destroy the desires of our body in this they serve the same purpose as fasting and austerity if your senses are dulled by illness you do not need to fast in the same way that a powerful medicine cures an illness so illness itself is a medi cine to cure passion and there is much profit of soul in bearing illness quietly and giving thanks to god if we go blind let us not be disturbed we have lost a means to excellence yet we can contemplate the glory of god with the inward eyes of the soul if we go deaf let us remember that we shall no longer hear a lot of silly talk if suffering has weakened the strength of 21 ps u8 i8 22 ps 66 is ps 4 1 the sayings of the fathers 87 your hands you still have an inner strength against the enemy's attacks if the whole body is afflicted by disease the health of the inner man is still increasing 18 she also said people in the world who commit crime are thrown into prison against their will for our sins let us put ourselves under guard and by willingly accepting it now we shall avoid punishment in the future if you fast you should avoid saying that by weakening your frame you have fallen ill for people who do not fast fall ill in the same way if you have begun some good work you should not be turned from it by the enemy's attempts to hinder you indeed your endurance will conquer the enemy seamen beginning a voyage set the sails and look for a favourable wind and later they meet a contrary wind just because the wind has turned they do not throw the cargo overboard or abandon ship they wait a little and battle against the storm until they can again set a direct course and when we run into headwinds let us put up the cross for our sail and we shall voyage through the world in safety 19 they said of abbess sarah of blessed memory that for sixty years she lived on the bank of a river and never looked down to see the water 20 abba hyperichius said keep praising god with hymnody and meditate continually and so lift the burden of the temptations that come upon you a traveller carrying a heavy burden stops from time to time to take deep breaths and so makes the journey easier and the burden lighter 21 he also said temptations come to us in all kinds of ways we ought to be armed at all points and then we shall appear to them to be tried warriors when they come against us 22 an old man said if a man is tempted sufferings crowd round him on all sides and he becomes timid and begins to grumble and the old man told this story a temptation came to a brother who lived at cellia and if anyone saw him they did not wish him well nor did they welcome him into their cells if he was short of bread no one lent him any if he was on his way back from harvesting no one followed the usual custom of inviting him in for refreshment once he had been reaping and he became very thirsty and had no bread in his cell but in all these tribulations he kept thanking god and god seeing his patience took away his inner struggle and gave him rest and immediately there was a knock on his door and a man from egypt was outside leading a camel laden with 88 western asceticism bread when the brother saw it he began to weep and said lord i am not worthy of even a little suffering and now that his trial was over the brothers welcomed him in their cells and in the church and refreshed him 23 an old man said we do not make progress because we do not know what we can do we lose heart in the work we have begun and we want to be good without trying to be good 53 24 23 a brother asked an old man what am i to do my thoughts will not let me sit alone in my cell even for an hour the old man said my son go back and stay in your cell wash your hands pray god continually and cast your thoughts upon god and let no one persuade you to go out of your cell and he said a lad who was living in the world with his father decided to become a monk but though he begged his father to allow it the father kept refusing until in the end at the request of some devout friends he consented with an ill grace and the lad left home and entered a monastery as soon as he was a monk he began to keep the monastic rule perfectly and to fast every day he even began to go without food for two days and to eat a proper meal only once a week his abba saw him and marvelled and blessed god for his self discipline after a short time it happened that the monk began to beg his abba please let me go into the desert the abba said c my son do not think of it you cannot endure austerity like that or the skill and temptation of the devil when you are tempted in the desert there is no one to comfort you in the roubles which the devil stirs up but the monk began the more to ask him to let him go and his abba seeing that he could not hold him said a prayer and let him go then he said to his abba tlease give me guides to show me the right way and the abba selected two monks from that monastery to go with him for two days they walked through the desert and then were exhausted with the heat so they lay down and slept for a little while they were asleep an eagle swooped down and beat at them with its wings and then flew off a little and alighted they woke up and saw the eagle and said here's your angel rise and follow him the brother rose and bid the brothers good bye and followed the eagle which flew a little and then alighted and on his approach flew a little further this went on for three hours then the eagle flew off to the right of the pursuing monk and did not reappear nevertheless the 23 omitted from all the early manuscripts the sayings of the fathers 89 monk went that way and saw three palm trees and a spring and a little cave he said here's the place that god has made ready for me he went into the cave and stayed there eating dates and drinking the water from the spring for six years he lived there alone and saw no man but one day the devil came to him disguised as an elder with a fierce expression on his face the brother saw him and was frightened and fell down to pray and when he rose again the devil said to him let us pray again brother and when they rose again the devil said how long have you been here he answered six years and the devil said this is remarkable i have had you as my neigh bour and i did not find out until four days ago i have a hermit age not far from here and this is the first day in eleven years that i have left it because i discovered that you were living near me and i considered the matter and said shall i go to this man of god and consult him for the good of my soul i tell you brother we do no good sitting like this in our cells we cannot receive the body and blood of christ and i am afraid that he will cast us away if we separate ourselves from that sacrament but i tell you brother three miles from here is a monastery with a presbyter let us go there every sunday or every other sunday and receive the body and blood of christ and return to our cells the brother was pleased and persuaded by the devil's sug gestion on sunday the devil came and said come it is time to go they went out and came to the monastery where the presbyter was entered the church and fell to prayer when the monk ended his prayer he could not see his guide anywhere and said where do you think he has gone has he had to go out he waited some time but his guide did not return he went out of the church and looked round for him but could not find him so he asked the monks of the place where is the abba who came to church with me they said we saw no one eke but you then the brother knew he was a demon and said see the skill with which the devil has winkled me out of my cell yet he cannot touch me because i have come here for a good reason i shall receive the body and blood of christ and go back to my cell after mass in the church the brother wanted to go back to his cell but the abbot of the monastery kept him saying unless you dine with us we shall not let you go back so he shared their dinner and went back to his cell 90 western asceticism then the devil came again this time in the likeness of a young man of the world and began to look him up and down from head to foot and say is this the man it is not and he began to stare at him the brother said to him why are you gazing at me and the devil said i think you do not know who i am how should you know after so long a time i am the son of your father's neighbour is not your father's name this and your mother's that and your sister's that and your name that are not your two serving girls called such and such but your mother and sister died three years ago now your father has died and left his property to you saying my son who in holiness left the world and followed god is the only heir left to me so i will leave him everything if anyone is a prophet of the lord and knows where he is let him speak then my son can come and take my wealth and give it away to the poor for the benefit of my soul and his soul and many people went seeking you but could not find you i was brought here acci dentally by some work and recognized you do not delay but come sell it all and do what your father wanted the brother answered i have no need to go back to the world 5 the devil said if you do not come and your wealth vanishes you will have to give an account of it before god surely i am saying nothing wicked in telling you to come and give money to the poor and needy like a good and generous man and so prevent money left to the poor from being mis appropriated by evil men and women what is the trouble in coming to give alms as your father wanted for the good of your soul and then returning to your cell so he persuaded the brother to return to the world he went with him as far as the town and left him the brother was making to enter his father's house as the house of a dead man when his father came out alive and well he did not recognize his son but said who are you the monk in his surprise could not say a word his father began again to ask him who he was and whence he came then in his confusion he said i am your son his father said why have you come back he was ashamed to say why he had come so he said my love made me return i wanted to see you and he stayed at home and soon he fell into lust and was severely punished by his father and was wretched and did no penance but remained in the world so i tell you my brothers that a monk never ought to let himself be persuaded by anyone to leave his cell 25 in the desert some people came to a great old man and the sayings of the fathers gi said how is it you are happy here in this severe life and the old man said all the severity of my life here cannot compare with the day of torment prepared for sinners in the next world 26 an old man said the ancients were reluctant to move from place to place except perhaps for three reasons first if a man was vexed against them and no amount of satisfaction would propitiate him secondly if many people praised them and thirdly if they were tempted to lust 27 a brother said to abba arsenius what am i to do abba my thought troubles me telling me you cannot fast nor work nor visit the sick because even these things are selfish the old man saw that the devil had sown the thought and said go eat and drink and sleep only do not leave your cell remember that staying in the cell is what keeps a monk on his proper path he did it for three days and then suffered from accidie so he found a few palm leaves and split them the next day he began to make a plait from them when he grew hungry he said to himself here are a few more palm leaves i shall lay them out before i eat and after he had finished he said i shall read a little before i eat and after he had finished he said i shall say a few psalms and then i shall eat with an untroubled mind so step by step he made progress with god's help until he came back to the right way and when he had received con fidence against evil thoughts he overcame them 28 an old man was asked by a brother why when he stayed in his cell he suffered accidie the old man answered you have not yet seen the resurrection for which we hope nor the torment of fire if you had seen these then you would bear your cell without accidie even if it was filled with worms and you were standing in them up to your neck 29 the brothers asked an old man to rest from his great labour he answered believe me my sons if abraham was penitent when he saw god's glorious gifts should we not struggle the more in our labour 30 a brother asked an old man and said my thoughts wander and i am troubled he answered go on sitting in your cell and your thoughts will come back from their wander ings if a she ass is tethered her foal skips and gambols all round her but always comes back to the mother so will it be with the man who for god's sake sits patiently in his cell though his thoughts wander for a time they will come again 31 an old man lived in the desert twelve miles from the 92 western asceticism nearest water once on his way to draw water he felt exhaus ted so he said what need to suffer this i will come and live by the spring as soon as he said this he turned round and saw a man following him and counting his steps he asked the man who are you and he said i am an angel of the lord sent to count your steps and reward you when the old man heard this his mind was strengthened and he moved his cell five miles further from the spring 32 the fathers used to say if you are tempted where you are do not leave the place at a time of temptation if you do leave it you will find the temptation which you are fleeing wherever you next place your cell be patient till the temptation is past then your departure will scandalize no one and bring no trouble to the other people who live there 33 a brother was restless in the community and often moved to anger so he said i will go and live somewhere by myself and since i shall be able to talk or listen to no one i shall be tranquil and my passionate anger will cease he went out and lived alone in a cave but one day he filled his jug with water and put it on the ground it happened suddenly to fall over he filled it again and again it fell and this happened a third time and in a rage he snatched up the jug and broke it returning to his right mind he knew that the demon of anger had mocked him and he said here am i by myself and he has beaten me i will return to the community wherever you live you need effort and patience and above all god's help and he rose up and went back 34 a brother asked an old man what am i to do father i do nothing like a monk i eat drink and sleep as i like i am much troubled by vile thoughts i shift from task to task and my mind wanders everywhere the old man answered stay in your cell and do what you can without trouble of mind it is only a little that you do now yet it is even as when abba antony did mighty things in the desert i trust god that who ever stays in his cell for god's sake and guards his conscience will be found where antony is 35 an old mau was asked how a watchful monk should not be scandalized when he sees others returning to the world and he replied a monk ought to look at hounds when they are hunting a hare one of them glimpses the hare and gives chase the others merely see a hound running run some way with him then they get tired and go back on their tracks only the leading hound keeps up the chase until he catches the sayings of the fathers 93 the hare he is not deterred by the others who give up he thinks nothing of cliffs or thickets or brambles he is often pricked and scratched by thorns yet he keeps on until he catches the hare and so the man who searches for the lord jesus aims unceasingly at the cross and leaps through every obstacle in his way until he comes to the crucified 36 an old man said a tree cannot bear fruit if it is often transplanted so it is with the monk 37 when a brother was troubled by thoughts of leaving the monastery he told this to his abbot and he said go and sit down and entrust your body to your cell as a man puts a precious possession into a safe and do not go out then let your thoughts go where they will let your mind think what it likes so long as it does not drive your body out of the cell 38 an old man said the monk's cell is the furnace in babylon in which the three children found the son of god it is the pillar of cloud out of which god spoke to moses 39 for nine years a brother was assailed by temptations to leave his community every day he picked up his cloak to go the cloak in which he wrapped himself at night at evening he would say i will go away tomorrow and at dawn he would think i ought to bear this torment and stay here just today for the lord's sake he did this every day for nine years until the lord took away temptation 40 a brother fell into temptation and in his suffering he stopped keeping the monastic rule when he later tried to start keeping the fundamentals of the rule he was hampered by his suffering and he said to himself when shall i be as i once was and in this gloomy state of soul he could not make himself begin the monastic office so he went to an old man and told him what had been happening when the old man heard of his sufferings he told him this story by way of example a man had a plot of land and through his carelessness brambles sprang up and it became a wilderness of thistles and thorns then he decided to cultivate it so he said to his son go and clear that ground so the son went to clear it and saw that the thistles and thorns had multiplied so his spirit weakened and he said how much time shall i need to clear and weed all this and he lay on the ground and went to sleep he did this day after day later his father came to see what he had done and found him doing nothing and he said to him why have you done nothing till now and the lad said to his father i was just coming to work father when i saw this 94 western asceticism wilderness of thorn and thistle and i was deterred from start ing and so i lay on the ground and went to sleep then his father said to him son if you had cleared each day the area on which you lay down your work would have advanced slowly and you would not have lost heart so the lad did what his father said and in a short time the plot was cultivated so you brother do a little work and do not faint and god will give you grace and bring you back to your proper way of life the brother went away and patiently did what the old man had told him and he found peace of mind and made progress with the help of the lord christ 41 there was an old man who was often ill but one year he did not fall ill and he was grievously troubled and wept saying the lord has left me and has not visited me 42 an old man said that a brother was goaded by his thoughts for nine years to despair of his salvation he judged himself and said i have ruined my soul and because i have perished already i will go to the world on his journey he heard a voice saying those temptations which you endured for nine years were your crowns go back to your cell and i will take from you these evil thoughts thereupon he realized that it is not good to despair of oneself because of the temptations that come if we use these thoughts well they will give us a crown 43 an old man was living in a cave in the thebaid with one well tested disciple it was usual for the old man to teach the disciple during the evening and show him how the soul should progress and after the address he prayed and sent him away to sleep some devout laymen who knew the old man's ascetic life happened to visit him he gave them consolation and they went away then the old man sat down after the evening offices as usual to address and instruct the brother but while he was talking sleep overcame him the brother waited for the old man to wake and end with the usual prayer but the old man went on sleeping and the brother went on sitting for a long time and in the end the disciple with greatly troubled mind was forced to go away to sleep but he tormented himself and re sisted the temptation and went back to sit by the old man a second time he was forced up by the longing for sleep but sat down again this happened seven times and still he went on resisting his soul the sayings of the fathers 95 in the middle of the night the old man awoke and found lim sitting nearby and said are you not gone away yet nd he said no you did not dismiss me father the old nan said why did you not wake me up he answered i lid not dare to nudge you for fear of disturbing you they both stood up and began to say mattins after mattins he old man dismissed his disciple and while the old man was itting alone he was rapt and was shown a vision of a glorious lace and a throne in it and on the throne seven crowns and le asked the angel who showed the vision whose are those nd he said they are the crowns of your disciple god has jiven him this place and throne because of his goodness onight he has been granted these seven crowns the old man marvelled and tremblingly called his disciple o him and said tell me what you did last night he mswered forgive me father i did nothing the old man udged that he was being humble and concealing something ind said believe me i cannot rest until you tell me what you lid and thought last night but the brother was not aware hat he had done anything and could not say a word but he aid to the old man forgive me father i did nothing except nly this that seven times i was driven by wandering thoughts go away and sleep but you had not dismissed me as you isually do so i did not go then the old man at once understood that every time he esisted the temptation god bestowed a crown on him to the lisciple he said nothing thinking it best for his soul but he old other directors of souls to teach us how god can bestow rowns upon us even for resisting little temptations it is good hat a man discipline his whole self for god's sake as it is vritten the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force 24 44 once a hermit fell ill because he had no one to look after lim he rose and ate whatever he found in his cell though this lappened for several days no one came to visit him even after 1 month no one had come and the lord sent his angel to ninister to him after the angel had ministered to him for a veek the fathers remembered him and said to each other let us go and see whether the old man is ill they went to xis cell and the moment they knocked on the door the angel leparted from him the old man inside shouted go away ny brothers but they lifted the door off its hinge and went in matt 11 12 96 western asceticism and asked him why he shouted and he said for a month i was ill and no one visited me now for a week an angel of the lord has ministered to me but he went away the moment you arrived and with these words he peacefully died the brothers marvelled and glorified god saying the lord does not leave them who trust in him 45 an old man said if you fall ill do not be a weakling if the lord god has willed that your body be feeble who are you to bear it with grief does he not look after you in all you need surely you do not live without him be patient in your illness and ask him to give you what is right that is that you may do his will and abide in patience and in charity eat what you have 46 one of the fathers said when i was in oxyrhynchus the poor came on friday evening to eat the agape and while they were asleep afterwards there was one only with a mat he put half the mat underneath him and the other half on top but he was still very cold and when he went to relieve himself i heard him grumbling and moaning about the cold and he consoled himself thus c i thank thee lord how many wealthy men are in prison sitting on iron or with shackled feet so that they cannot even go out and relieve themselves freely but i am like an emperor i can stretch my legs and walk wherever i like 9 i was standing there and heard what he said and i went in and told the brothers and they were much edified to hear it 47 a brother asked an old man if i were somewhere where there was no one whom i could consult in a suffering which afflicted me no one to show me the passion of my soul what should i do the old man said believe in god for he will send his grace and will himself be your consolation if you ask him in charity and he added i have heard a story like this from scete there was a man enduring temptation and he had no confidence in any of the confessors and so he got his bundle ready to go away but during the night he saw a vision of god's grace in the form of a maiden who asked him c do not go stay here with me for no ill will happen to you from what you have heard he believed her words and stayed in his cell and at once was healed in his heart part viii that nothing should be done for show i abba antony once heard this about a young monk and the piece of show he wrought on a journey he saw some old men the sayings of the fathers 97 wearily walking along the road and he ordered donkeys up to carry them until they reached home when the old men told this to abba antony he said i think that monk is like a ship laden with a rich cargo but not yet certain of reaching port in safety and shortly afterwards abba antony began to weep and pull his hair and groan when his disciples saw it they said why are you weeping abba 3 and the old man answered a great pillar of the church has just fallen he said this about the young monk and added come walk over to him and see what has happened so his disciples went and found the monk sitting on his mat and weeping for the sin which he had committed when he saw abba antony's disciples he said tell the old man to pray god to give me an armistice for only ten days and i hope to be able to satisfy him within five days he was dead 2 the monks praised a brother to abba antony but antony went to him and tested whether he could endure abuse and when he perceived that he could not bear it he said you are like a house with a highly decorated fagade where burglars have stolen all the furniture out of the back door 3 they said of abba arsenius and abba theodore of pherme that they hated reputation and praise above everything abba arsenius avoided people likely to praise him abba theo dore did not avoid them but their words were like daggers to him 4 archbishop john had a disciple named eulogius eulogius was a presbyter who fasted for two days at a time and sometimes ate nothing but bread and salt for a whole week wherefore he had a high reputation he came to abba joseph at panephysis because he believed he would find harder discipline under him the old man welcomed him and of his charity made ready what he had to cat but the disciples of eulogius said the presbyter only eats bread and salt abba joseph silently began to eat they spent three days in silence hearing not even the sound of psalm or prayer for they said the office secretly and then eulogius and his disciples went away nothing edified but by god's providence a mist came over the plain and they wandered in a circle and came back in error to the old man joseph's cell before they knocked on the door they heard the singing of psalms within and they waited a long while outside listening then they knocked on the door and the old man welcomed them again eulogius was thirsty and his disciples picked up a jug of water and gave it to him to drink but the 98 western asceticism jug had sea water mixed with fresh and he could not drink it eulogius considered this in his mind and then began to ask the old man to show him his system saying how is it abba that first you did not sing any psalms and then you began after we had gone away and why was the water salt when i tried to drink it the old man said my disciple is away at work and i made a mistake and put sea water in but eulogius went on asking the old man wanting to know the truth and the old man told him that little chalice is for wine which we use in charity to guests this is for the water which the brethren drink every day with these words he taught him to have mental discretion and drove put of him the merely human motives and he be came like other people and in future ate what was put be fore him and he learnt to be severe in secret and said to the old man truly yours is a labour of love 5 abba zeno the disciple of abba silvanus said never stay in a well known place nor sit with a famous man nor lay a foundation on which you might sometime build yourself a cell 6 once a brother came to abba theodore of phcrme and spent three days asking him for a word but the abba did not answer and he went away sadly so abba theodore's disciple asked him abba why did you not speak to him look he has gone away sad and the old man said believe me i said nothing to him because his business is getting credit by retailing what others have said to him 7 another brother asked abba theodore would you like me to eat no bread for several days and the old man said you would do well i have sometimes done that and the brother said should i take a few peas to the mill and make vegetable meal and abba theodore said if you go to the mill make yourself bread what need is there of this carrying to and fro 8 another brother asked the same old abba theodore and he began to talk and enquire about matters of which he had no experience and the old man said to him you have not yet found a ship to sail in nor put your luggage aboard nor put out to sea and are you already in the city which you mean to reach if you make some attempt at a thing you are discussing you will discuss it as it truly is 9 abba cassian 25 said that a brother came to abba scra ps coherences xviii 1 1 apophthegmatq serapion 4 of this translation p a 7 1 the sayings of the fathers 99 pioti and the old man encouraged him in the usual way to offer prayer but he said that he was a sinner and unworthy of the monk's habit and so refused serapion wanted to wash his feet but he used the same words and would not allow it serapion gave him supper and then began to exhort him in charity saying son if you want to make progress stay in your cell keep a watch upon yourself and attend to the work of your hands nothing is more profitable to you than staying in your cell but when the brother heard him he was bitterly angry and the old man could not help seeing the change in his face so abba serapion said to him just now you were saying c i am a sinner and accusing yourself of living like an unworthy monk then why were you angry when i warned you charitably if you truly would be humble learn to carry like a man the burdens which others lay upon you and do not shower terms of abuse over yourself when the brother heard this he did penance before the old man and went away with much profit 10 once a provincial judge heard of abba moses and went to scete to see him they told the old man that he was on his way and he rose up to flee into a marsh the judge and his train met him and asked tell me old man where is the cell of abba moses and the old man said why do you want to see him he is a fool and a heretic the judge came to the church and said to the clergy i heard of abba moses and came to see him but an old man on his way to egypt met me and i asked him where was the cell of abba moses and he said why are you looking for him he is a fool and a heretic and the clergy were distressed and said what sort of person was your old man who told you this about the holy man and they said he was an old man tall and dark wearing the oldest possible clothes and the clergy said that was abba moses and he told you this about him self because he did not want you to see him and the judge went away much edified 1 1 a brother asked abba mathois if i go to live in such and such a place what would you have me do there the old man said if you live there do not try to make a reputation for yourself on some pretext like saying either i will not join the congregation or i will not eat this and that this is the sort of thing that creates a bubble reputation and afterwards you will suffer from crowds when people hear that sort of thing they flock there 12 abba nesteros the great was walking in the desert with ioo western asceticism a brother when they saw a dragon and ran away the brother said are you afraid father the old man answered i am not afraid my son but it was good to run away from the dragon for otherwise i should have had to run away from vanity 13 a provincial judge once wanted to see abba poemen and the old man would not allow it the judge arrested his sister's son as a criminal and imprisoned him saying if the old man comes to ask for him i will release him and the lad's mother came to abba poemen her brother and began to weep outside the door of his cell stricken with grief she began to reproach him saying you may have a heart of cold steel you may be pitiless but at least have mercy on your kin and relent but he told her poemen is the father of no children and she went away when the judge heard this he sent a messenger to say you have only to order his release and i will release him the old man sent back the messenger with this message try his case legally if he ought to die let him die if he is innocent do as you say 14 abba poemen also said teach your heart to keep what your tongue teaches others he also said men try to appear excellent in their preaching they are less excellent in practising what they preach 15 once abba adelphius who was bishop of nilopolis came to abba sisois on the mountain of abba antony when he was just leaving he made him eat at dawn but it was a fast day and when they brought the table some brothers knocked at the door the old man said to his disciple give them a few buns because they are weary and abba adelphius said to him dismiss them for a time or they will say abba sisois ate at dawn and abba sisois looked at him and said to the brother go give them some so when they saw the cooked food they said have you got visitors is even the old man eating with you and the brother said yes then they began to be sad and say god forgive you that you have let the old man eat at this hour do you not know that he has gone into a severe discipline for a great many days when the bishop heard this he began to do penance before the old man and said forgive me abba my thought was human you did what is of god and abba sisois said to him unless god glorifies man man's glory cannot last 1 6 abba ammon of the place called raythu brought this enquiry to abba sisois when i read the scripture i am the sayings of the fathers ioi tempted to make elaborate comments and so prepare myself to answer questions on it the old man said there is no need it is better to speak the word simply with a good conscience and a pure mind 1 7 once a provincial magistrate came to see abba simon and abba simon took the leather belt which he wore and climbed a palm tree to clean it with the palm leaves when the judge's party came up they said where is the old hermit of this wilderness and he answered there is no hermit here abouts so the judge went away 1 8 another time a magistrate came to see him and the clergy who went in front said to him abba be ready for the judge has heard of you and is coming to be blessed by you and he covered himself with his sackcloth and took bread and cheese in his hand and sat down in his doorway and began to eat it the magistrate arrived with his retinue and when they saw the old man they were contemptuous of him and said is this the hermit about whom we heard such great things and they turned round and went straight home 19 saint syncletice said an open treasury is quickly spent and any virtue will be annihilated if it is published abroad and becomes famous if you put wax in front of a fire it melts and if you pour vain praises on the soul it goes soft and weak in seeking goodness qo she also said the same thing cannot at once be seed and full grown bush so men with a worldly reputation cannot bear heaven's fruit 21 once at a feast day in cellia the brothers were eating their meal in church but one of them said to the server i eat nothing cooked but salt and the serving monk called to another brother in front of the whole crowd this brother does not eat what is cooked bring him the salt but one of the old men stood up and told him today it would have been better for you to eat meat in your cell than to have heard this said in front of so many brothers 22 a man was being abstinent and not eating bread and he went to visit an old man by chance some other pilgrims arrived there and the old man made them a little vegetable soup when they sat down to eat the fasting brother took a single pea which he dipped in the soup and chewed it when they rose from the table the old man took him to one side and said brother if you visit someone do not display to him your manner of life if you want to keep your own rules stay in your 102 western asceticism cell and never go out the brother accepted the advice and thenceforth behaved like other people and ate what was put before him 23 an old man said if a man takes thought for the mor row it cuts away his fertility of spirit and leaves him dry 24 an old man said make yourself in many things a fool in fleeing the company of men or in mocking the world and the men of the world part ix that we should judge no man 1 a brother in the community of abba elias was once tempted and being expelled from the community he went away to the mountain to abba antony and when he had stayed there with him for some time antony sent him back to his old community but when they saw him they drove him out again again he went to abba antony and said thcy will not have me father so the old man sent a message to them saying a ship was wrecked in the ocean and lost its cargo and with great difficulty the lightened ship was brought to land do you want to run a rescued ship aground and sink it they saw that abba antony had sent him back and at once accepted him 2 a brother sinned and the presbyter ordered him to go out of church but abba bessarion rose up and went out with him saying i too am a sinner 3 abba isaac of the thebaid came to a community and saw one of the brothers to be blameworthy and sentenced him but when he had gone out to the desert the angel of the lord came and stood in front of the door of his cell and said i will not let you go in he asked why not and the angel of the lord answered god sent me to say this to you where do you command me to send that blameworthy brother whom you sentenced 5 and at once abba isaac did penance saying i have sinned forgive me and the angel said arise god forgives you but in future take care you judge no man before god has judged him 4 in scete a brother was once found guilty they assembled the elders and sent a message to abba moses telling him to come but he would not come then the presbyter sent saying come for a meeting of monks is waiting for you moses rose up and went he took with him an old basket which he filled with sand and carried on his back the people who went the sayings of the fathers 103 to meet him said what is this father the old man said to them my sins are chasing me and i do not see them have i come today to judge the sins of someone else they listened to him and said nothing to the erring brother but pardoned him 5 abba joseph asked abba poemen tell me how to be come a monk the old man said if you want to find rest in this life and the next say at every turn c who am i 3 and judge no man 6 a brother asked abba poemen if i see my brother sin is it good to tell no one about it the old man said when ever we cover our brother's sin god will cover our sin when ever we tell people about our brother's guilt god will do the same with ours 7 once a brother in a community stumbled in the same region there lived a hermit who for a long time had not gone out of his cell the abbot of the community went to the hermit and told him of the monk's offence the hermit said expel him so the monk was expelled from the community and flung himself in a ditch and wept some other monks happened to pass that way to see abba poemen and they heard him groan ing in the ditch they climbed down and found him in des perate grief and they asked him to go to the old hermit but he refused saying i shall die here the brothers went to abba poemen and told him about it he asked them to go back to the monk and say abba poemen summons you they did what he said and the monk came to abba poemen the old man saw how he was suffering and rose up and kissed him and hospitably invited him to take supper but abba poemen sent one of his brothers to the hermit with this message i have heard of you and for many years have wanted to meet you but we were both too lazy to arrange a meeting but now by god's will and this opportunity make the tiring journey so that we can meet for poemen was under a rule of not going out of his cell when the hermit heard the message he said he would not have sent to me unless god had inspired him to it and he rose up and went they greeted each other with pleasure and sat down abba poemen said to him there were two men in one place and they were each mourning for a dead man but one left his own dead and went away to weep for the other's and the old hermit was stricken at the saying and remembered what he had done and he said poemen is up in heaven i am down on earth io4 western asceticism 8 a brother asked abba poemen what am i to do for i become a weakling just by sitting in my cell the old man said despise no one condemn no one abuse no one and god will give you quietness and you will sit tranquil in your cell 9 once there was a meeting of monks in scete and the fathers discussed the case of a guilty brother but abba pior said nothing afterwards he rose up and went out he took a sack filled it with sand and carried it on his shoulders and he put a little more sand in a basket and carried it in front of him the fathers asked him what are you doing he answered the sack with a lot of sand is my sins they are many so i put them on my back and then i shall not weep for them the basket with a little sand is the sins of our brother and they are in front of me and i see them and judge them this is not right i ought to have my own sins in front of me and think about them and ask god to forgive me when the fathers heard this they said truly this is the way of salvation 26 10 an old man said judge not the adulterer if you are chaste or you will break the law of god likewise for he who said do not commit adultery also said judge not 1 1 the presbyter of a church came to a hermit to con secrate the offering for him to communicate but another man came to the hermit and made accusations against that presbyter the next time that the presbyter came to consecrate as usual the hermit was scandalized and would not let him in the presbyter saw it and went away and then the hermit heard a voice saying men have taken my judgement into their own hands and he was rapt and saw a vision of a well of gold and a bucket of gold and a rope of gold and plenty of drinking water and he saw a leper emptying and refilling the bucket and he wanted to drink himself but did not because the leper had emptied it then the voice came a second time to him and said why do you not drink this water what does it matter who fills it for he only fills it and pours it out again then the hermit came back to his normal mind and under stood what the vision had meant he called the presbyter and made him consecrate the offering as before 12 two brothers in a community lived a saintly life and had made such progress that they could see the grace of god in each other it happened that one of them went out of the 2 notice the doublet with section 4 of this part cf the version in vitae patrum iii 136 the sayings of the fathers 105 monastery on a friday and saw a man eating though it was morning he said to him are you eating at this hour on a friday on the saturday the usual celebration of mass was held and his brother saw that the grace which had been given him had departed from him and he was distressed he went to the cell and said what have you done brother i did not see the grace of god in you as i used to do and he said i am not aware of having sinned either in deed or thought his brother said did you say an idle word to someone and he remembered and said yes yesterday i saw someone eating food in the morning and i said to him are you eating at this hour on a friday that is my sin be severe with me for a fortnight and we will beg god to forgive me they did so and after a fortnight the brother saw the grace of god again coming upon his brother and they were comforted and gave thanks to god who alone is good i2a a holy man wept bitterly when he saw someone sin ning and said he today i tomorrow however grave a sin is brought to your notice you must not judge the culprit but believe yourself to be a worse sinner than he partx on discretion 1 abba antony said some wear down their bodies by fasting but because they have no discretion it puts them further from god 2 some brothers came to abba antony to tell him their dreams and discover whether they were true or were the illu sions of demons they had with them a donkey who died on the journey when they arrived at the old man he said before they told him why did your donkey die on the journey and they said how do you know father and he said the demons showed me they said to him indeed we came to ask you on the subject we have seen dreams which have often come true and we did not want to go astray the old man satisfied them taking his example from the donkey and showing them that these dreams are caused by demons a hunter happened to come through the brush and saw abba antony talking gladly with the brothers and was displeased the old man wanted to show him how we should sometimes be less austere for the sake of the brethren and said to him put io6 western asceticism an arrow in your bow and draw it he did so and he said draw it further and he drew it he said again draw it yet further and he drew it the hunter said to him if i draw it too far the bow will snap abba antony answered so it is with god's work if we go to excess the brothers quickly be come exhausted it is sometimes best not to be rigid the hunter was penitent when he heard this and profited much from it and the brothers thus strengthened went home 3 a brother said to abba antony pray for me and the old man answered neither i nor god will have mercy on you unless you take trouble about yourself and ask god's help 4 abba antony also said god does not let inner wars be stirred in this generation because he knows that they are too weak to bear it 5 abba evagrius once said to abba arsenius how is it that we educated and learned men have no virtue and egyptian peasants have a great deal abba arsenius answered we have nothing because we go chasing worldly knowledge these egyptian peasants have acquired virtues by hard work 6 abba arsenius of blessed memory said a foreign monk not living in his native province will be half hearted in nothing and so will be at rest 7 abba mark asked abba arsenius is it good not to have any comfort in one's cell i saw a brother who had a few cabbages and he was rooting them out and abba arsenius said it is good but each man should do what is right for his own discipline if he has not strength to endure that he will plant them again 8 abba peter the disciple of abba lot told this story i was once in the cell of abba agatho when a brother came to him and said i want to live with the monks tell me how to live with them the old man said trom the first day you join them remember you are a pilgrim all the days of your life and do not be too confident abba macarius said to him what does confidence do the old man said it is like a fierce drought when it is so dry everyone flees the land because it destroys even the fruit on the trees abba macarius said is bad confidence like that abba agatho said no passion is worse than confidence it is the mother of all passion it is best for the monk's progress that he should not be confident even when he is alone in his cell 9 abba daniel said when abba arsenius was dying he charged us thus do not make a love offering for me for if i the sayings of the fathers ioy have made any love offering for myself during my life i shall find it 10 they said of abba agatho that some people went to him because they heard he was a man of much discretion and wanting to test whether he was irritable they said to him are you agatho we have heard of you that you are an adult erer and an arrogant man and he answered it is true and they said to him are you that agatho who gossips and slanders and he answered i am and they asked him are you agatho the heretic and he answered i am no heretic and they asked him tell us why did you patiently endure us when we so abused you but did not endure when we said you were a heretic and he answered i assented to the first charges against myself it is for the good of my soul but i did not agree when you said i was a heretic because that is to be separated from god and i do not want to be separated from god they admired his discretion and went away edified 11 abba agatho was asked which is more difficult bodily discipline or the guard over the inner man the abba said man is like a tree his bodily discipline is like the leaves of the tree his guard over the inner man is like the fruit scripture says that every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire 27 so we ought to take every pre caution about guarding the mind because that is our fruit yet we need to be covered and beautiful with leaves the bodily discipline abba agatho was wise in understanding earnest in discipline armed at all points careful about keeping up his manual work sparing in food and clothing 12 in scete there was a meeting to discuss a matter and after the decision was taken abba agatho came and said you have not made a good decision they said to him who are you that say this and he answered the son of man for it is written if ye truly speak righteousness judge ye the thing that is right o ye sons of men 3 28 13 abba agatho said if an angry man raises the dead god is still displeased with his anger 14 three old men came to abba achillas and one of them had a bad reputation the first old man said abba make me a fishing net and he said i will not and the second said 27 malt 3 10 28 gf ps 58 1 108 western asceticism to him will you give us a memento of yourself to keep in our community and he answered i have no time then the third who had the bad reputation said to him make me a fishing net and so i shall have a blessing from your hands abba and at once he answered i will do it but the first two whom he had refused said privately to him why did you refuse our requests and consent to his the old man answered i said to you that i would not do it because i had no time and you were not vexed but if i did not do it for this man he would say the old man has heard my reputation and for that reason has refused to make me a net so immedi ately i set to work with the string to soothe his soul and prevent him being sad 15 they said of one old man that for fifty years he ate no bread and drank little water and he said i have destroyed lust and greed and vanity when abba abraham heard that he had said this he came to him and said was it you who said this and he answered yes and abba abraham said to him supposing you go into your cell and find a woman on your mat could you not think she was a woman and he said no but i attack my thought so as not to touch her abba abraham said then you have not killed lust but the passion is still alive you have imprisoned it suppose you were walking along a road and saw stones on one side and gold in jars on the other could you think the gold and the stones of the same value and he answered no but i resist my thought so as not to pick it up and abba abraham said to him then the passion still lives but you have imprisoned it and he went on if you heard that one brother loved you and spoke well of you and another brother hated you and slandered you and they both came to visit you would you give them both the same welcome and he said no but i torture my soul to treat him who hates me just as well as him who loves me and abba abraham said to him then passions are alive only in some measure holy men have got them chained 1 6 one of the fathers said that an old man was working earnestly in his cell wrapt in his mat he went to visit abba ammon who saw him using his mat and said to him this is not good for you and the old man said three thoughts trouble me one tries to drive me to live somewhere else in the desert the second that i should go out and find a foreign country where no one knows me the third that i should shut myself in my cell see no one and eat every other day abba the sayings of the fathers icq ammon said to him none of these three would profit you stay in your cell and eat a little every day keeping always in your heart the words of the publican in the gospel 29 and you can be saved 17 abba daniel said if the body is strong the soul withers if the body withers the soul is strong he also said if the body is fat the soul grows lean if the body is lean the soul grows fat 1 8 abba daniel also said that when abba arsenius was in scete there was a monk who stole the property of the old men abba arsenius wanting to do him good and free the old men from being troubled took him to his cell and said if you will stop stealing i will give you whatever you want and he gave him gold money and trinkets and everything he found in his bag but the monk stole again the old man seeing that he was always troubling them expelled him and said if you find a brother committing crime through bodily infirmity you must bear with him but if he does not stop after being warned expel him he hurts his own soul and also disturbs everyone who lives there 19 soon after abba evagrius had become a monk he went to an old man and said abba speak to me a word by which i may be saved he said if you would be saved when you go to visit a man do not speak until he asks you a question evagrius was stricken by this word and did penance before the old man and satisfied him saying believe me i have read many books and never found such learning and he went away much profited 20 abba evagrius said a wandering mind is strengthened by reading and prayer passion is dampened down by hunger and work and solitude anger is repressed by psalmody and long suffering and mercy but all these should be at the proper times and in due measure if they are used at the wrong times and to excess they are useful for a short time but what is only useful for a short time is harmful in the long run 21 abba ephraem was passing by when a harlot she was someone's agent began to make every effort to attract him to unlawful intercourse or if she failed in this at least to stir him to anger for no one had ever seen him angry or brawling he said to her follow me when they came to a crowded place he said to her come now i will lie with you as you wanted 29 god be merciful to me a sinner luke 18 13 110 western asceticism she looked round at the crowd and said how can we do it here with all these people standing round we should be ashamed he said if you blush before men should you not blush the more before god who discloses the hidden things of darkness and she went away without her pleasure confused and nonplussed 22 some brothers once came to abba zeno and asked him what is meant by the text in the book of job heaven is not pure in god's sight 30 the old man answered these brothers have left their sins and search the heavenly places the meaning of that text is that since god alone is pure it may be said that not even heaven is pure in his sight 23 abba theodore of pherme said if a friend of yours is tempted by lust give him a helping hand if you can and pull him back but if he falls into heresy and persists in spite of your efforts go away quickly cut off his friendship for if you dally with him you might be dragged with him into the deeps 24 once abba theodore came to abba john who had been born a eunuch while they were talking abba theodore said when i was in scete i devoted myself to the soul's work and treated the body's work so to speak as a side issue but now it is vice versa i treat the soul's work as though it was the side issue 25 once one of the fathers came to abba theodore and said look that brother has gone back to the world and abba theodore said to him do not be surprised at that be sur prised when you hear that a man has been able to escape the jaws of the enemy 26 abba theodore said many choose the repose of this world before god gives them his rest 27 they said of abba john the short that he once said to his elder brother i wanted to be free of trouble as the angels are free labouring not and serving god unceasingly he stripped himself of his clothes and went into the desert after a week there he went back to his brother and when he knocked on the door his brother answered without opening it and said who's there he said i am john and his brother answered john has become an angel and is no longer among men but he went on knocking and saying it is l and his brother did not open the door but left him out till morning as a punishment at last he opened the door and said if you are a 30 job 15 15 the sayings of the fathers iii man you need to work again in order to live if you are an angel why do you want to come into my cell 33 and he did penance and said forgive me my sin brother 33 28 once some old men came to scete and abba john the short was with them during supper an eminent presbyter rose to give them each a little cup of water to drink no one except john the short accepted it the others were surprised and said how is it that you the least of all dared to accept the ministry of a great old man and he said when i get up to give the water round i am glad if everyone takes it because i have been able to do them a service and will have a reward that is why i took it just now to let the minister have his reward perhaps he would have been sad if no one had accepted it 3 and they all admired his discretion 29 abba poemen once asked abba joseph saying what am i to do when temptations approach me do i resist them or let them come in 33 the old man said let them come in and then fight them 33 so he went back to his cell at scete and it happened that a man from the thebaid told the brothers in scete that he had asked abba joseph the question when temptation ap proaches do i resist it or do i let it come in 33 and he said to him on no account let it come in but cut it straight off when abba poemen heard that abba joseph had said this to the man from the thebaid he rose and went back to abba joseph at panephysis and said to him abba i entrusted my thoughts to your care and you said one thing to me and the opposite to a monk from the thebaid 3 and the old man said you know that i love you 33 and he answered yes 33 and he said did you not tell me to say what i thought as though i was talking for my own good if temptations come in and you deal with them there they will prove you i said this to you as i should say it to myself but there are other men whom it is bad that passions should come near and they should cut them straight off 33 30 abba poemen said in lower heracleon i once came to abba joseph and he had in his monastery a very beautiful mulberry tree in the morning he said to me c go fetch yourself some mulberries and eat 3 it was friday so i did not eat as it was a fast day and i asked tor the lord 3 s sake tell me why you said to me go eat 33 1 did not go because it was a fast day but i was ashamed to disobey your command for i think you had some reason for it 3 but he replied elders do not at first 112 western asceticism speak straightly to brothers but say some very twisted things and if they see that the brothers do these twisted things then they only speak what is good for them because they know that the brothers will obey them in everything 31 a brother asked abba joseph what shall i do i cannot bear to be troubled nor to work nor to give alms and the old man said to him if you cannot do any of these at least keep your conscience from every sin against your neighbour and you will be saved for god seeks the soul that does not sin 32 abba isaac from the thebaid said to his brothers do not bring children here children were the reason why four churches in scete were deserted 33 abba longinus asked abba lucius i have three ideas the first is to go on a pilgrimage and the old man answered if you do not control your tongue whensoever you travel you will be no pilgrim but control your tongue here and you will be a pilgrim without travelling abba longinus said my second idea is to fast two days together and abba lucius answered the prophet isaiah said even if you bend your neck to the ground your fast will not so be accepted 3 1 you should rather guard your mind from evil thoughts and abba longinus said my third idea is to avoid the sight of men and abba lucius answered unless you first correct your sin by living among men you will not be able to correct yourself when you live alone 34 abba macarius said if we remember the ill which men have done us we cut off from our minds the power of recollect ing god but if we remember the ill which the devils raise we shall be undisturbed 32 35 abba mathois said satan knows not which passion will seduce the soul and so he scatters his tares in it without direc tion at one time he throws in the seeds of lust at another the seeds of slander and the rest in the same way and wheresoever he sees a soul drawn towards one of the passions he ministers to that soul if he knew what was most tempting to a soul he would not scatter such a variety of temptations 36 they told this story of abba nathyra who was the disciple of abba silvanus when he was living in his cell on mount sinai he regulated his life with moderation and allowed himself what his body needed but after he was made bishop in 31 cf isa 58 5 32 a fuller version is verba seniorwn paschasius vii 37 4 the sayings of the fathers 113 pharan he sorely afflicted his spirit with severe austerities and his disciple said to him abba when we were in the desert you were not wont to torment yourself like this and the old man said to him my son there we had solitude and quiet and poverty and so i wanted to discipline my body in such a way that i did not fall sick for if i had fallen sick i would have needed assistance which i could not have upon mount sinai but now we are in the world and there are many oppor tunities of sin and if i fall ill there are friends who will help me and prevent me from falling away from a monk's purpose 37 a brother asked abba poemen i am troubled in spirit and want to leave this place and the old man said why and he said i have heard unedifying stories about one of the brothers and the old man said are the stories true and he said yes father the brother who told me is a man of trust and the old man answered the brother who told you is not a man of trust for if he was so he would not have told you these stories when god heard the cry of the men of sodom he did not believe it until he had gone down and seen with his own eyes and the brother said i too have seen it with my own eyes when the old man heard this he looked down and picked off the ground a wisp of straw and he said what is this and he answered straw then the old man reached up and touched the roof of the cell and said what is this and he answered it is the beam that holds up the roof and the old man said take it into your heart that your sins are like this beam and that brother's sins are like this wisp of straw when abba sisois heard this saying he marvelled and said how shall i bless you abba poemen your words are like a precious jewel full of grace and glory 38 some neighbouring priests once came to the monastery of abba poemen abba anub went in and said to him let us invite these priests to receive the gifts of god here in charity but abba poemen stood in silence for a long time and made no reply and abba anub went out sadly the men sitting round said to abba poemen why did you not answer him and abba poemen said to them i have no reason to do so for already i am dead dead men do not speak do not blame me that i am here in your company 39 a brother once went out on a pilgrimage from the monastery of abba poemen and came to a hermit who lived 114 western asceticism in charity towards all and received many visitors the brother told the hermit stories of abba poemen and when he heard of poemen's strength of character he longed to see him the brother returned to egypt and after some little time the hermit rose and went from his country to egypt to see the brother who had visited him for he had told him where he lived when the brother saw the hermit he was astonished and very glad the hermit said to him of your charity towards me take me to abba poemen and the brother raised him up and showed him the way to the old man and the brother told abba poemen this about the hermit a great man of much charity and particular honour in his own province has come here wanting to see you so the old man received him kindly and after they had exchanged greetings they sat down but the hermit began to talk of the holy scripture and of the things of the spirit and of heaven but abba poemen turned his face away and answered nothing when the hermit saw that he would not speak with him he was distressed and went out and he said to the brother who had brought him there my journey was useless i went to the old man and he does not deign to speak to me the brother went to abba poemen and said abba it was to talk with you that this great man came here a man of much honour in his own land why did you not speak to him the old man answered he is from above and speaks of the things of heaven i am from below and speak of the things of earth if he had spoken with me on the soul's passions i would willingly have replied to him but if he speaks of the things of the spirit i know nothing about them so the brother went out and told the hermit the reason is that the old man does not easily discuss scripture but if anyone talks to him about the soul's passions he answers then the hermit was stricken with penitence and went to the old man and said what shall i do abba my passions rule me and the old man gazed at him with gladness and said now you are welcome you have only to ask and i will speak with understanding and the hermit was much strength ened by their discourse and said truly this is the way of charity and he thanked god that he had been able to see so holy a man and returned to his own country 40 a brother asked abba poemen and said i have com mitted a great sin and i would do penance for three years the sayings of the fathers but abba poemen said to him that is a long time 5 and the brother said do you order me one year's penance and again the old man said that is a long time some of the people who were nearby said a penance of forty days again the old man said that is a long time and he added i think that if a man is penitent with his whole heart and determined not to sin that sin again god will accept a penance of even three days 41 abba ammon questioned him on the subject of the impure thoughts bred within a man's heart and on the subject of vain desire and abba poemen said shall the axe boast unless the woodman wield it 33 do not reach out your hands for these things and they shall do you no harm 42 abba isaiah asked him about the same subject abba poemen said clothes left too long in a chest become rotten if our bodies do not bring those thoughts forward then at length they will rot or be destroyed 43 abba joseph asked him about the same subject and abba poemen said if you shut a snake or a scorpion in a box in the end it will die and the wicked thoughts which the demons scatter slowly lose their power if the victim has endur ance 44 abba joseph asked abba poemen how should we fast and abba poemen said i would have everyone eat a little less than he wants every day abba joseph said to him when you were a young man did you not fast for two days on end and the old man said to him believe me i used to fast three days on end even for a week but the great elders have tested all these things and they found that it is good to eat something every day but on some days a little less and they have shown us that this is the king's highway for it is easy and light 45 abba poemen said do not live in a place where some are jealous of you you will make no progress there 46 a brother came to abba poemen and said to him i sow seed in my field and make a love feast with the crop the old man said you do a good work and he went away with purpose and invited more to the love feast which he was making when abba anub heard this he said to abba poemen are you not afraid of god that you spoke so to the brother and the old man said nothing but two days later abba poemen sent 33 cf isa 10 15 il6 western asceticism to the brother and called him to his cell and he said to him in the hearing of abba anub what did you ask me the other day my mind was elsewhere the brother said i sow my field and make a love feast with the crop and abba poemen said to him i thought you were talking about your brother who is a layman what you are doing is not a monk's work the brother was sad when he heard this and said this is the only kind of work that i can do or know i cannot stop sowing seed in my field when he had gone away abba anub began to do penance before abba poemen and said forgive me abba poemen said to him look i knew from the beginning that it was not a monk's work but i spoke to his soul's need and stirred his soul to an increase of charity and now he has gone away melancholy yet he will go on with the same work 47 a brother asked abba poemen what is the meaning of the text whoever is angry with his brother without a cause 5 34 and he answered it is if you are angry with your brother for any trouble whatsoever that he tries to lay upon you that is anger without a cause and it is better to pluck out your right eye and cast it from you but if anyone wants to separate you from god be angry with him 48 abba poemen said if a man sins and denies it saying i have not sinned do not blame him or you will break his purpose to amend if you say c do not be cast down my brother but keep a watch on it in future you stir his heart to be penitent 49 the same father said experience is good by experience men are tested 50 he also said if a man preaches but does not practise what he preaches he is like a well of water where everyone can quench their thirst and wash their dirt but which cannot clean away the filth and dung that is around it 51 he also said he who knows himself is a man he also said one man seems silent of speech but is con demning other people within his heart he is really talking incessantly another man seems to talk all day yet keeps his silence for he always speaks in a way that is useful to his hearers 52 he also said suppose there are three men living to gether one lives a good life in quietness the second is ill but gives thanks to god the third ministers to their needs with 3 matt 5 22 according to many ancient authorities the sayings of the fathers sincerity these three men are alike it is as if they were all doing one work 53 he also said wickedness cannot drive out wickedness if anyone hurts you do him good and so by your good work you will destroy his wickedness 54 he also said the grumbler is no monk the man who gives evil for evil is no monk the irritable man is no monk 55 a brother came to abba poemen and said to him many thoughts come into my head and put me in peril and the old man drove him out into the open air and said open your lungs and hold your breath and he answered i cannot do it and the old man said to him just as you cannot stop air coming into your breast you cannot stop thoughts coming into your mind your part is to resist them 56 a brother asked him i have been left a fortune what am i to do with it and abba poemen said to him go and come back in three days and i will tell you the brother came back as he was told and the old man said what can i tell you brother if i say give it the church they will dine off it if i say give it to your relations you will have no profit if i say give it to the poor you will be safe so go and do what you like with it i can give you no reasons for choosing 57 abba poemen also said if a thought about your bodily needs comes to you and you put it aside and then it comes again and you put it aside what will happen if it comes a third time you will not heed it and it will do you no harm 58 a brother said to abba poemen if i see something do you want me to tell you the old man said to him it is written e lf a man answers before he has heard it is foolishness to him and discredit 35 if you are asked speak if not say nothing 59 abba poemen told a saying of abba ammon one man carries an axe all his life but cannot cut down a tree another knows how to use it and cuts down the tree with a few strokes he used to say that the axe was discretion 60 he also said the will of a man is a brazen wall and a stone hurled between himself and god if he puts it aside he can say the words of the psalm in my god i shall go over a wall and as for my god his way is undefiled 3 s if righteous ness helps the will then a man does good 6 1 a brother asked abba poemen i am suffering the loss 35 gf ecclesiasticus 11 8 3 ps 18 29 30 il8 western asceticism of my soul by being with my abba what do you order me should i continue to stay with him and abba poemen knew that his soul was being harmed by his abba and was astonished that he asked whether he ought to stay with him and he said to him if you want to stay do so and the brother went away and stayed with his abba but he came a second time to abba poemen and said i am burdening my soul and abba poemen did not say to him leave the abba he came a third time and said believe me henceforth i shall no longer stay with him and the old man said now you are saved come and stay with him no longer and he went on a man who sees his soul being harmed has no need to ask a man ought to ask about his secret thoughts to get them tested by the elders but there is no need to ask about obvious sins they must at once be cut off 62 abba abraham who was a disciple of abba agatho once asked abba poemen why do the demons attack me and abba poemen said to him do the demons attack you the demons do not attack us when we follow our self wills because then our wills become demons and themselves trouble us to obey them if you want to know the kind of people with whom the demons fight it is moses and men like him 63 abba poemen said that a brother asked abba moses how does a man mortify himself is it by his neighbour and he answered unless a man has it in his heart that he has been shut in a tomb for three years he cannot attain to mortifica tion 64 a brother asked abba poemen and said how ought a brother to sit in his cell and the old man said to sit in the cell is externally to work with the hands eat once a day keep silence and meditate and internally to make progress by carrying a reproach wheresoever you may be and keeping the hours of prayer and keeping a watch on the secret thoughts of the heart if it is time to stop working with the hands fall to prayer and finish it in tranquillity the end of it all is to keep company with men of good life and avoid the company of the wicked 65 two brothers once came to abba pambo and one of them asked him abba i fast for two days and then eat two large buns do you think i am saving my soul or losing it and the other said with my hatids i make two vegetable stews every day and i keep a little for food and give the rest away in alms do you think i shall be saved or lost and al the sayings of the fathers iiq though they pressed him for an answer he did not reply after four days they were on the point of going and the clergy said to them do not be distressed god will reward you this is always the way of the old man he does not talk easily unless god gives him something to say so they went in to the old man and said abba pray for us and he said to them do you want to go away and they said yes and he gazed at them and supposing himself in their place he wrote upon the ground and said pambo fasts for two days and eats two large buns do you think this makes him a monk no then he said and pambo makes two vegetable stews every day and gives them away to the poor do you think this makes him a monk not yet he was silent for a little and then said these works are good but if you act conscientiously to your neighbour that is the way to be saved and so the brothers were edified and went away joyfully 66 a brother asked abba pambo why do the spirits pre vent me doing good to my neighbour the old man said do not talk like that or you will make god a liar say i do not at all want to be kind for god came down and said c i have given you the power of treading upon scorpions and snakes and over all the might of the enemy 37 why then do you not trample on the unclean spirits 67 abba palladius said the soul which is being trained according to the will of christ should either be earnest in learn ing what it does not know or should publicly teach what it knows if it wants to do neither though it could it is mad the first step on the road away from god is contempt for teaching when it has no desire for the foods of the soul which truly loves god 3 68 a brother ssid to abba sisois why do my passions not leave me and the old man said to him because the vessels of those passions are within you give them a pledge and they will go away 69 a brother came to abba silvanus on mount sinai and when he saw the brothers working he said to the old man labour not for the meat which perisheth and mary hath chosen the best part 39 and the old man said to his disciple call zacharias and put this brother in a cell where there is 37 luke 10 19 38 from the letter of palladius to lausus cf the greek in c butler the lausiac history ofpalladitts vol ii p 7 3 john 6 127 luke 10 412 i2o western asceticism nothing and when three o'clock came he kept looking at the door to see when they would send someone and summon him to eat but no one spoke to him so he rose and went to the old man and said abba do not the brethren eat today and the old man said yes they have eaten already and the brother said why did you not call me and the old man answered you are a spiritual person and do not need food we are earthy and since we want to eat we work with our hands but you have chosen the good part reading all day and not wanting to take earthly food when the brother heard this he prostrated himself in penitence and said forgive me abba and the old man said i think mary always needs martha and by martha's help mary is praised 70 saint syncletice said merchants toil in search of riches and are in danger of their lives from shipwreck the more wealth they win the more they want and they think of no worth what they have already but bend their whole mind to what they have not yet but we have nothing even of what we ought to seek and we do not even want to possess what we need because we fear god 71 she also said there is a useful sorrow and a des tructive sorrow sorrow is useful when we weep for sin and for our neighbour's ignorance and so that we may not relax our purpose to attain to true goodness these are the true kinds of sorrow our enemy adds something to this for he sends sorrow without reason which is something called accidie we ought always to drive out a spirit like this with prayer and psalmody 7 1 a she also said it is good not to be angry if it happens do not give way to it for as much as one day 713 she said let not the sun go down upon your wrath but you wait until the sun is going down on your life you do not know how to say sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof why do you hate the man who has harmed you it is not he who has harmed you but the devil you ought to hate the sickness not the sick man 7 ic she also said it is dangerous for a man to try teaching before he is trained in the good life a man whose house is about to fall down may invite travellers inside to refresh them but instead they are hurt in the collapse of the house it is the same with teachers who have not carefully trained themselves in the good life they ruin their hearers as well as themselves their mouth invites to salvation their way of life leads to ruin 72 she also said the devil sometimes sends a severe fast too the sayings of the fathers 121 prolonged the devil's disciples do this as well as holy men how do we distinguish the fasting of our god and king from the fasting of that tyrant the devil clearly by its moderation throughout your life then you ought to keep an unvarying rule of fasting do you fast four or five days on end and then lose your spiritual strength by eating a feast that gladdens the devil everything which is extreme is destructive so do not suddenly throw away your armour or you may be found un armed in the battle and made an easy prisoner our body is like armour our soul like the warrior take care of both and you will be ready for what comes 73 two old men came from the pelusium country to the abbess sarah on their way they said to each other let us humble this old woman 53 and they said to her take care that your soul be not puffed up and that you do not say look some hermits have come to me a woman 5 and the abbess sarah said to them i am a woman in sex but not in spirit 74 abbess sarah also said if i asked god that all men should be edified in me i should be doing penance at the door of everyone i pray rather that my heart should be pure in all things 75 abba hyperichius said the man who teaches men by his life and not his speech is the true wise man 76 there once came from the city of rome a monk who had held a high place in the palace he lived near the church in scete and had with him a servant who ministered to him the priest of the church saw that he was infirm and knew that he was accustomed to comfort and so he passed to him whatever the lord gave him or was given to the church after he had lived in scete for twenty five years he became celebrated as a contemplative with the spirit of prophecy one of the great egyptian monks heard of his reputation and came to see him in the hope that he would find a more austere way of life he came into the cell and greeted him and after they had prayed they sat down but the egyptian saw his soft clothing and a bed of reeds and a blanket under him and a little pillow under his head and his clean feet with sandals on them and he was inwardly scandalized in scete they never used to live like this but practised a sterner abstinence but the old roman with his gift of contemplation and second sight saw that the egyptian monk was inwardly scandal ized and he said to his servant make us a good meal today 122 western asceticism for this abba who has come and he cooked the few vegetables which he had and they rose and ate at the proper hour and he had a little wine by reason of his infirmity and they drank that and at evening they said twelve psalms and went to sleep afterwards and the same in the night but at dawn the egyptian rose and saying pray for me he went away not edified at him and when he had gone a little way off the old roman wanted to heal his mind and sent after him and called him back and he said what is your province and he answered i am an egyptian and he said of what city and he answered of no city i never lived in a city and he said before you were a monk how did you earn your living and he answered i was a herdsman and he said to him where did you sleep he answered in the fields and he said had you any mattress and he answered how should i have a mattress for sleeping in a field and he said and how did you sleep he answered on the ground and he said what did you eat when you were in the fields and what wine did you drink and he answered what kind of food and drink do you find in a field and he said how then did you live he answered i ate dry bread and salt fish if there were any and i drank water and the old man said a hard life and he said was there a bath on the farm where you worked and the egyptian said no i washed in the river when i wanted and when the old man had extracted these answers and knew how he lived and worked before he became a monk he wanted to help him and so he described his own past life in the world this wretch in front of you came from the great city of rome where i had an important post at the palace in the emperor's service and when the egyptian heard this first sentence he was stricken and began to listen attentively and he went on so i left rome and came into this desert and he said i whom you see had great houses and wealth and i scorned them and came to this little cell and he said i whom you see had beds ornamented with gold with costly coverings and instead of them god gave me this bed of reeds and this blanket my clothes were rich and expensive and instead of them i wear these tatters and he said on my dinner table i used to spend much money and instead of it he has given me these few vegetables and this little cup of wine many servants used to wait upon me and instead the lord has the sayings of the fathers 123 given this one man alone a spirit penitent enough to look after me instead of a bath i dip my feet in a little bowl of water and i use sandals because of my infirmity for the pipe and the lyre and all the varieties of music which used to delight me at dinner i say twelve psalms in the day and twelve psalms in the night but for the sins which once i committed i now offer this poor and useless service to god in quietness see then abba do not be scandalized at my infirmity 5 and when the egyptian heard it he came to himself and said i am a wretch i came from a hard life of labour to be at rest in the monk's way of life and now i have what i did not have before but you have come of your own accord to this hard life and have left the comforts of the world you came from honour and wealth to loneliness and poverty and he went away with much profit and he became his friend and used to go to the old man for his soul's good for he was a man of discerning and was full of the fragrance of the holy spirit 77 an old man said all this talking is unnecessary nowa days everyone talks and what is needed is action that is what god wants not useless talking 78 a brother asked some of the fathers whether a man suffered pollution if he thought on vileness when they were asked this question some said yes and some said no for if he were polluted we ordinary people could not be saved if we think of vile actions but do them not this brings salvation the questioner was discontented with the fathers diverse answers and he went to an experienced old man and asked him and the old man replied everyone is required to do accord ing to his capacity then the brother asked the old man for the lord's sake explain this saying to me and the old man said look suppose there was a jug of value and two brothers came in one of whom had a great capacity for a disciplined life and the other a small capacity suppose that the mind of the more disciplined man were moved at the sight of the jug and he said inwardly c i would like to own that jug but the thought does not remain and he quickly drives away the desire then he would not be polluted but if the less disciplined man coveted the jug and was strongly moved by an impulse to take it and yet did not take it he would not be polluted 79 an old man said if a man lives in a place but does not harvest the crops of that place the place drives him out because he has not done the work of that place 124 western asceticism 80 an old man said if a man does anything according to his self will and not according to god's will he can afterwards return to the lord's way if he did it in ignorance but the man who obeys his self will and not god's and will not listen to admonition but thinks he knows will hardly be able to come to the lord's way 81 an old man was asked what is meant by the text narrow and strait is the way and the old man answered narrow and strait is the way by which a man does violence to his thoughts and for god's sake breaks down his self will this is what was written of the apostles e lo we have left all and followed thee 4 82 an old man said as the order of monks is more honour able than that of men of the world so the travelling monk ought to be in every way a mirror for the monks of the places where he stays 83 one of the fathers said if a labourer remains where there are no other labourers he can make no progress the true labourer struggles that the work may not deteriorate if an idle man works with a labourer the idle man becomes less idle and if he does not make progress at least he does not get idler by seeing someone working 84 an old man said if a man has words but no works he is like a tree with leaves but no fruit just as a tree laden with fruit is also leafy the man of good works will also have good words 85 an old man said that a man once committed a grave sin stricken with penitence he went to confess to an old man he did not tell him what he had done but put it in the form of a question if such a thought rose in a man's mind would he be saved the old man who had no discretion answered you have lost your soul when the brother heard this he said well if i perish i will go to the world but on his way he considered the matter and decided to tell his temptations to abba silvanus who possessed great discretion in these matters the brother went to him and did not tell him what he had done but again put it in the form of the question if such a thought arose in a man's mind would he be saved silvanus began to speak to him with texts from scripture and said that judgement does not fall dn people tempted to sin the brother perceived the force of the saying and took hope and told him what he had done when to matt 7 14 19 27 the sayings of the fathers 125 abba silvanus learnt what he had done he acted like a skilled physician and put on his soul a poultice made of texts from scripture showing him that repentance is available for them who in truth and in charity turn to god after some years abba silvanus met the old man who had driven the brother to despair and told him what had happened and said that brother who despaired because of your words and had gone back to the world is now a bright star among the brothers he told him this so that we may know how perilous it is when a man confesses his thoughts or sins to people without discretion 86 an old man said we are not condemned if ill thoughts enter us but only if we use them ill through our thoughts we may suffer shipwreck through our thoughts we may attain a crown 87 an old man said do not give to or receive from men of the world take no notice of a woman do not have con fidence for long in a boy 88 a brother asked an old man what shall i do for i am troubled by many temptations and know not how to repel them the old man said do not fight against them all but against one of them all the temptations of monks have a single head you must consider what it is what kind of tempta tion and fight it and in this way all the other temptations will be defeated 89 an old man said against evil thoughts i beg you my brothers control your thoughts as you control your sins 90 an old man said anyone who wants to live in the desert ought to be a teacher and not a learner if he still needs teaching he will suffer harm 91 an old man was asked by a brother how do i find god with fasts or labour or watchings or works of mercy the old man replied in all that you have said and in dis cretion i tell you that many have afflicted their body but have gained no profit because they did it without discretion even if our mouths stink with fasting and we have learnt all the scriptures and memorized the whole psalter we still lack what god wants humility and charity 92 a brother asked an old man abba look i ask my elders questions and they speak to me for the salvation of my soul and i can remember nothing that they say is it any use asking questions when i profit nothing i am deep in impurity there were two empty vessels nearby and the old man said go and take one of those vessels away and put oil in it and 126 western asceticism rinse it and pour out the oil and put the vessel back and he did so and he said do it again and he did it and after he had done it several times the old man said now take both vessels and see which is the cleaner and he answered the one into which i put oil the old man said so it is with the soul which asks questions although it remembers nothing that it hears it will be cleaner than the soul which never asks questions 93 a brother was sitting quietly in his cell and demons wanted to seduce him in the guise of angels and they stirred him up to go out to the congregation in church and they showed him a light but he went to an old man and said abba angels come to me with light and stir me to go to the congregation and the old man said to him heed them not my son they are demons when they come to stir you out say i go when i want and do not listen to you 3 he accepted the command and returned to his cell on the next night the demons came again as usual to stir him he answered as he had been told i go when i want and do not listen to you and they said to him that wicked old man has trapped you a brother came to him to borrow money and although he had some he lied and said that he had none and would give him nothing that shows you he is a deceiver at dawn the brother rose and came to the old man and told him what had happened the old man said to him it is true i had money and i did not give to the brother who wanted to borrow some i knew that if i gave it to him i should be harming his soul i thought it better to transgress one com mandment than ten if he had received money from me we should have come into trouble on his account so do not listen to the demons who want to seduce you and the brother went back to his cell much comforted by the words of the older man 94 three brothers once came to an old man in sccte one of them asked him abba i have memorized the old and new testaments and the old man answered you have filled the air with words and the second asked him i have written the old and new testaments with my own hand but the old man said and you have filled the window ledge with manu scripts and the third said the grass is growing up my chimney and the old man answered and you have driven away hospitality 95 some of the fathers told this story of a great old man if the sayings of the fathers 127 anyone came to ask a word of him he used to say with great confidence look i am acting in place of god and sitting in his judgement seat what do you want me to do for you if you say to me have mercy upon me god says to you if you want me to have mercy on you you must have mercy on your brothers and then i will have mercy on you if you want me to forgive you you must forgive your neighbour then is god the cause of guilt god forbid it is in our power if we do not want to be saved 96 they said of an old man in gellia that he was a great worker while he was at a work a holy man happened to come to his cell and when he was outside the door he heard the old man within battling with his thoughts and saying am i to lose everything because of a single word the man out side thought that he was quarrelling with someone else and knocked on the door to go in and make peace between them but when he went in and saw no one else there he had faith in the old man and said with whom were you quarrelling abba he replied with my thoughts i have memorized fourteen books and when i was outside i heard one little word and when i came to say the divine office i had forgotten all fourteen books and could remember only the one word which i heard outside and that is why i am quarrelling with my thoughts 97 some brothers from a monastery came into the desert to see a hermit and he received them gladly and as is the way of hermits he saw that they were tired with their journey and made a meal for them though it was not the proper time for a meal and so refreshed them with what he had in his cell and in the evening they said twelve psalms and twelve more in the night while the old man was keeping watch he heard them saying hermits have more rest in the desert than do monks in the monastery in the morning they were departing to visit a neighbouring hermit and he said to them greet him for me and tell him do not water the vegetables the neighbouring hermit understood the message and kept them working until evening without any food and at evening he prolonged the divine office to great length and then said let us rest a little for your sakes you are tired after your labours and he said we do not usually eat today but let us eat a little for your sake and he brought them dry bread and salt and said look we have a feast today because you have come and he added a little 128 western asceticism sour wine to the mixture and they rose and began to sing psalms until dawn and he said 6 because you travellers are here you must rest a little and that prevents us keeping the rule and at daybreak they wanted to go hastily but he asked them to stay and said spend a little time with me or at least for the commandment's sake keep the hermit's way of life with me for three days but when they saw that he was not letting them rest they stole away in secret 98 a brother asked one of the fathers if by chance i oversleep and am late for the hour of prayer i am ashamed that others will hear me praying so late and so i become reluctant to keep the rule of prayer and the old man said if ever you oversleep the dawn rise when you wake shut the door and the windows and say your office for it is written the day is thine and the night is thine 41 god is glorified whatever time it is 99 an old man said one man eats a lot and is still hungry another eats a little and has had enough the man who eats a lot and is still hungry has more merit than the man who eats a little but enough for him 100 an old man said if some distressing controversy rises between you and another and the other denies it and says e l said no such thing 3 do not argue with him or say you did say it for he will be exasperated and will say very well i did say it 101 a brother asked an old man my sister is poor if i give her alms am i giving alms to the poor the old man said no the brother said why abba and the old man replied because your kinship draws you a little towards her 1 02 an old man said a monk ought not to listen to dis paragement he ought not to be disparaged and he ought not to be scandalized 103 an old man said do not be pleased at everything which is said and do not agree with everything that is said be slow to believe and quick to say what is true 1 03 a an old man said that even though holy men had to endure much in the desert they had already received some portion of the heavenly rest but he meant it for those who are free from worldly cares 1033 an old man said if a monk knows a person with u ps 74 16 the sayings of the fathers whom he would make progress but in a place where the life would be hard he is an atheist if he does not go there 1030 a brother asked a boy monk is it good to speak or keep silence the boy said to him if the words are idle leave them unsaid if good find room for them and speak but even if the words are good do not prolong what you say but cut it short and so you will have peace of mind 104 an old man said sometimes a text enters the heart of a brother as he is sitting in his cell and the brother meditating inwardly upon the text cannot understand its meaning and is not drawn by god to true understanding then demons come to his help and show him whatever meaning suits them 105 one of the old men said when first we used to meet each other in the assembly and talk of what was helpful to our souls we became ever more withdrawn from the things of sense and mounted to the heavenly places but now we meet and spend our time in gossip and each drags the other downwards 1 06 another of the fathers said if our inner man behaves with seriousness it can control the outer man but if the inner man does not what other means is there of controlling the tongue 107 he also said we need to labour in praise of god because we have come into the desert if we are not labouring with our body we may labour mightily in god's praise 1 08 another father said a man ought always to be work ing at something in his cell if he is busy with the divine office the devil comes to him day after day but finds no resting place there and if he succeeds in conquering him and taking him prisoner god's spirit often comes again but if we are sinners and do not let god's spirit come to us he goes away 109 some egyptian monks once went down to scete to see the elders of that place and they saw them famished with a long fast and so wolfing their food and they were scandalized at them but the priest saw it and wanted to heal their minds and send them away edified and he preached to the people in the church saying my brothers prolong your fast yet fur ther the egyptian visitors wanted to leave but he kept them when they had fasted one day and then a second they were much weakened for he had made them fast for two days with out a break but in scete the monks fast for a week on saturday the egyptians sat down to eat with the old men and they reached voraciously for their food and one of the old men checked their hands and said eat like monks in a disciplined way 130 western asceticism one of the egyptians threw off his restraining hand and said leave go i am dying i have not eaten cooked food all the week and the old man said to him if you are so weak at a meal after a fast of only two days why were you scandalized at brothers who always keep their abstinence for a week at a time and they did penance before them and went away gladly edified at their abstinence no a brother who renounced the world and took the monk's habit immediately shut himself up in a hermitage saying i am a solitary when the neighbouring elders heard of it they came and threw him out of his cell and made him go round the cells of the brothers and do penance before them and say forgive me i am no solitary but have only lately begun to be a monk in some old men said if you see a young man climbing up to heaven by his own will catch him by the foot and pull him down to earth it is not good for him 112 a brother said to a great old man abba i wanted to find an old man after my own heart and die with him and the old man said your search is good my lord the brother reiterated his desire not understanding the irony of the old man but when the old man saw that he thought this was a good idea he said to him if you find an old man after your own heart you want to live with him and the brother said yes i wholeheartedly want this if i can find one according to my mind then the old man said to him you do not want to follow the will of an old man you want to follow yours and so you will be comfortable with him but the brother saw the sense of what he said and rose and prostrated himself in penitence saying forgive me i was very proud of myself for saying something good when in truth there was nothing good about me 113 two earthly minded brothers renounced the world the younger was the first to begin the converted life one of the fathers came to stay with them and they brought a basin of water for him to wash and the younger came to wash the feet of the old man but the old man took his hand and motioned him away and made the elder do it it is the custom for the first men in a monastery to do this but the brothers standing near said abba the elder brother is the younger in religion the old man answered and i take away the first place from the younger and give it to him who is older in years the sayings of the fathers 131 114 an old man said the prophets wrote books our fathers came after them and worked much at them and then their successors memorized them but this generation has come and it copies them on papyrus and parchment and leaves them unused on the window ledge 115 an old man said the cowl we use is the symbol of innocence the amice which covers neck and shoulders is the symbol of a cross the girdle the symbol of courage let us live our lives in the virtues symbolized by our habit if we do everything with earnestness we shall not fail part xi that it is right to live soberly 1 a brother asked abba arsenius to speak a word to him the old man said to him as far as you can strive to make your inner progress as god would have it and by it conquer the passions of the outer man 5 he also said if we seek god he will appear to us if we hold him he will stay with us 2 abba agatho said a monk ought not to let his con science accuse him about anything when this abba agatho was on his death bed he remained motionless for three days with his eyes open the brothers shook him saying abba where are you and he said i am standing in the presence of god's judgement they said to him are you afraid and he said mostly i have worked as much as i could to keep the commandments of god but i am a man and i do not know whether my works will be pleasing in god's sight the brothers said to him do you not trust in your works for they were obedient to god's will and the old man said i do not presume except i come before god for the judgements of god are not the judgements of men when they still wished to ask him to speak he said to them of your charity do not talk to me for i am busy and at the words he breathed forth his spirit with joy and they saw him welcoming his spirit as a man greets his dear friends in every thing abba agatho kept a careful guard and he used to say there is no virtue which a man can acquire without taking guard 3 they said of abba ammoi that when he went to church he did not let his disciple walk with him but made him follow a long way behind and if the disciple drew near to ask him 132 western asceticism something he gave him a rapid answer and drove him back at once saying i am afraid that while we are talking for the soul's good some irrelevant words will be spoken and that is why i do not let you walk by my side 4 abba ammoi began by saying to abba aesius how do you see me now 55 and he said like an angel father and later he said again now how do you see me and he said like satan for even if you speak a good word it is like a sword to me 5 abba allois said unless a man say in his heart only i and god are in the world he shall not find rest 6 he also said if a man wills in one day he can come by the evening to a measure of divinity 7 abba bessarion said when he was dying a monk ought to be all eye like the cherubim and seraphim 8 abba daniel and abba ammoi were once on a journey together abba ammoi said do you think sometime we shall rest in a cell father abba daniel said to him who can take god away from us god is abroad in the world and he is in the cell likewise 9 abba evagrius said it is a great thing to pray without hindrance it is a greater to sing psalms without hindrance 10 he also said if you always remember your death and do not forget the eternal judgement there will be no sin in your soul 11 abba theodore of the ninth region of alexandria said if god reckons to us the carelessness of our times of prayer and the captivity of our minds to other things during our psalmody we cannot be saved 12 abba theonas said our mind is hindered and held back from contemplating god because we are imprisoned in our bodily passions 13 some of the brothers once came to tempt abba john the short for he never let his mind wander among worldly thoughts and he never spoke for the world's sake they said to him thanks be to god it has rained hard this year and the palm trees have had enough water to begin to bear and so the brothers who are engaged in bodily labour will find fruit from their labour so abba john said to them so it is when the holy spirit comes down into the hearts of saintly men they grow green and fresh and in the fear of god put forth leaves 14 they said of this abba john that he once made enough the sayings of the fathers 133 material for two baskets and twisted it all into one basket but did not see what he was doing until he tried to hang them on the wall for his mind was occupied in the contemplation of god i4a abba john the short also said i am like a man sitting in the shade of a tall tree who sees wild beasts and snakes coming at him and knows his danger and rushes to climb the tree to safety i sit in my cell and see temptations coining at me and when i cannot stand up to them i rush to pray god and so i find safety from the enemy's attack 15 there was an old man in scete with a reasonable rule of bodily life but not at all careful in remembering what he heard so he went to abba john the short to ask him about forgetfulness he listened to abba john went back to his cell and forgot what he had been told he came a second time and asked him listened went back and forgot what he had heard the moment he had reached his cell many times he went back wards and forwards but could never remember he happened to meet the old man and said do you know father that i again forgot what you told me i did not wish to trouble you so i did not come again abba john said to him go light a lamp and he lit it and he said bring more lamps and light them from the first and he did so and abba john said to the old man was the first lamp harmed because you used it to light others and he said no so john is not harmed even if all the monks of scete should come to me it does not keep me from god's love so come to me whenever you want and do not hesitate and so by patience on both sides god cured the forgetful ness of the old man this was the work of the men of scete to strengthen those who were attacked by passion their own experience in the moral struggle enabled them to help others along the road 1 6 a brother asked abba john what am i to do a brother keeps coming and takes me away to help with the work which he is doing but i am wretched and sick and am too weak for it how then am i to obey god's commandment the old man answered him caleb the son of jephunneh said to joshua the son of nun 42 e l was forty years old when moses the servant of the lord sent me with you to that country and now i am eighty five then i was strong and i am still just as capable of beginning and ending a battle and so do you go 42 josh 14 6 and 10 11 inaccurately 134 western asceticism if you can finish the work as well as you begin it if you cannot sit in your cell and lament your sins and if they find you weeping when they come they will not force you to go out with them 17 abba isidore who was the priest in scete said when i was a young man and stayed in my cell i made no limit to the number of psalms which i used in the service of god night and day alike were spent in psalmody 1 8 abba gassian told a story of an old man living in the desert who asked god to grant that he never fell into a doze when the conversation was edifying but that if anyone spoke with back biting or hate he should immediately fall asleep and so he would not listen to the poisonous words he said that the devil strove earnestly to make men speak idle words and assailed all spiritual teaching in this connexion he gave the following example when once i was talking to some brothers for the good of their souls they fell into a drowsiness so deep that they could not even keep their eyelids open i wanted to show them that this was the devil's work so i started gossiping and at once they lost all drowsiness and began to enjoy what i was saying but i said sorrowfully c we were talking of the heavenly till just now and your eyes were drooping into heavy slumber but the moment the talk is frivolous you all begin to listen avidly i beg you then dear brothers since you know that this is the work of an evil demon to look to yourselves and beware of sleep when ever you are doing or hearing the things of the spirit 9 43 19 when abba poemen was a young man he once went to an old man to ask him three questions when he arrived at the old man's cell he forgot one of his three questions and went back to his own cell and he was just stretching out his hand for the key of his cell when he remembered the question which he had forgotten he left the key lying there and returned to the old man the old man said to him you have travelled fast to get here my brother 9 and poemen told him when i was stretching out my hand for the key i remembered the question so i did not open my cell door but immediately returned to you the distance between the cells was very great the old man 43 gassian institutes v 29 and 31 verba smiorum has again translated from a greek translation of gassian's latin text but it was a full translation and not an epitome gassian himself attributed the first story to an old man named machetes the sayings of the fathers 135 said to him truly you are poemen 44 shepherd of sheep for your name shall be renowned in all egypt 20 abba ammon came to abba poemen and said to him if i go to my neighbour's cell or if he comes to mine we are both frightened of unsuitable conversation which may harm our monastic purpose and the old man said to him you are right young men need to be on their guard abba ammon said to him what about old men and abba poemen said to him old men who make progress and are stable do not find these unsuitable words in their mouths and so they do not say them and abba ammon said if i need to talk with my neighbour do you think i should talk to him about the scrip tures or about the sayings and judgements of the elders and the old man said to him if you cannot keep silence it is much better to talk about the sayings of the elders than about the scriptures for the danger is no small one 21 abba poemen was asked about pollutions he replied if we strengthen our moral life and make earnest efforts we shall not find pollutions in ourselves 22 they used to say of abba poemen that when he was soon to go out for the divine office he first sat by himself for an hour in self examination and then went out 23 abba poemen said that a man asked abba paysio this question what am i to do to my soul it has become in capable of feeling and does not fear god and he said to him go and put yourself under a man who does fear god and when you live with him you will learn to fear god also 24 he also said the beginning and the end is the fear of the lord for thus it is written the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom 3 and when abraham built an altar the lord said to him now i know that thou fearest god 4s 24a he also said if a man makes a new heaven and a new earth he still cannot be safe from temptation 25 he also said depart from any man who is always scorn ful in his conversation 26 he also said i once asked abba peter the disciple of abba lot 6 when i am in my cell my soul is at peace but if some brother arrives and tells me what is being said outside my soul is troubled and abba peter told me that abba lot said your key has opened my door 44 poemen is greek for shepherd some of the latin translators turned his name into pastor 45 ps 1 1 1 io a et d gen 22 g and 12 136 western asceticism and i said what does that mean and he said if someone comes to visit you you ask him how are you where do you come from how are such and such brothers faring did they receive you or not then you are opening the door for your brother to talk and you hear words which you do not want to hear 3 and i said to him that is so but what shall a man do otherwise when a brother visits him and the old man said true teaching is always in sorrow where sorrow is not you cannot keep a watch on the mind and i said to him when i am in my cell sorrow is with me but when anyone visits me or when i go out of my cell i am sorrowful no longer and the old man said c you are not yet stable in sorrow you use it as a transitory and expedient feeling and i said what does that mean and he said to me if a man labours for something as vigorously as he can he finds it ready to hand whenever he needs it for his spiritual profit 27 a brother asked abba sisois i long to guard my heart the old man said to him and how can we guard the heart if our tongue leaves the door of the fortress open 28 abba silvanus was once living on mount sinai his disciple who was about to go off on some necessary task said to the old man bring water and water the garden the old man went to draw water and he covered his face with his cowl so that he could see only his feet by chance a visitor arrived to see him at that moment and looking at him from a distance marvelled at the sight and he went up to him and said tell me abba why did you cover your face with your hood and so water the garden and the old man said to him so that my eyes should not see the trees and my mind should not be disturbed from its work by the sight 29 abba moses asked abba silvanus can a man live every day as though it were the first day of his religious life abba silvanus answered if a man is a labourer he can live every day nay every hour as though it were the first day or hour of his religious life 30 some brothers once asked abba silvanus what way of life did you practise to be endowed with such prudence and he answered i never let any embittering thought remain in my heart 3 1 abba serapion said the imperial guards while on duty in the emperor's presence must keep their eyes to the front and not turn their heads to one side or the other and the monk in god's presence must keep his attention all the time upon the sayings of the fathers 137 the fear of god and so none of the enemy's wickednesses can affright him 9 3 1 a saint syncletice said my sons we all know the way to be saved and fail to travel it because we do not care 32 saint syncletice said let us live soberly for through our bodily senses willy nilly robbers come in the inside of the house is sure to be blackened when the smoke that is climbing up the outer walls finds the windows open 33 she also said we ought to be armed at all points against the demons they come at us from outside and are invited by the inner man if the soul is weak sometimes a ship is crushed by the battering of heavy seas sometimes it is sunk because the bilge water steadily rises within and in the same way we are sometimes condemned because we have committed wicked acts and sometimes because the inner thoughts are evil so we must watch for the assaults of unclean spirits and cleanse the thoughts of the heart 34 she also said we have no security in this world the apostle said c let him that standeth take heed lest he fall 46 we are sailing on uncharted seas as the psalmist david said our life is like a sea yet some seas have dangerous reefs some are full of sharks some seas are calm we seem to be sailing in calm waters while men of the world are sailing in rough weather and we are sailing in daylight led by the sun of righteousness while they are being driven along in the night time the night of ignorance yet it often happens that worldly men sailing in darkness and through storms are so afraid of the danger that they save the ship by calling upon god and by watchfulness while we in our calm waters become negligent get off the proper course of righteousness and are sunk 35 abba hyperichius said let your mind be ever upon the kingdom of heaven and you will soon win its inheritance 36 he also said the life of a monk should be like that of the angels in burning up sin 37 abba orsisius said i think that unless a man has a good watch on his heart he will become forgetful and careless in his conversation and so the enemy gets a footing in him and overthrows him a lamp will give light if it has oil and a trimmed wick but if the oil is forgotten it goes slowly out and little by little the shadows creep in upon it if a mouse comes to it and tries to eat the wick before it is quite out it is thwarted by the heat of the dying flame but when it sees that the light 46 i cor 10 12 138 western asceticism is gone and the wick is cool it knocks the lamp to the floor if the lamp is earthenware it is smashed if it is brass it is re parable if the soul is negligent the holy spirit goes from it little by little until it has grown quite cold and then the enemy devours the soul's purpose and wickedness puts an end to it if a man through his godward affection is a good man and has merely been caught in temporary negligence the merciful god stirs the mind to remember the punishment waiting for sinners in the next life and henceforth the mind takes trouble to be earnest and watches itself carefully until the time of its visita tion 55 38 an old man visited another old man in their con versation one said i am dead to the world 5 and the other said do not be self confident until you die you may say about yourself that you are dead but satan is not dead 55 39 an old man said a monk ought every day to examine himself morning and evening how far he has kept the lord's will he ought to be leading a penitential life all his days that was the way abba arsenius lived 5 40 an old man said if you lose gold or silver you can find something as good as you lost but the man who loses time can never make up what he has lost 55 41 an old man said before soldiers or hunters start on expeditions they do not consider whether some will be wounded and others unhurt each one fights for himself alone that is how the monk should be 55 42 an old man said no one can harm the man at the emperor's side and satan cannot harm us if our souls are fixed upon god as it is written draw nigh to me and i shall draw nigh unto you 547 but because we are so often puffed up with pride it is easy for the enemy to snatch away our wretched soul to carnal passion and its ignominy 55 42 a an old man said a man must work so that his work does not perish however much he does it is no use if it is im permanent it is work that is little and lasting which shall stand 55 42b an old man said sometimes i do a great work some times a little and i have regard to the results in my thoughts and deeds 5 420 an old man said waking or sleeping whatever you do a you will not fear the devil if god be before your eyes even 47 zech r 13 the sayings of the fathers 139 if temptation stays with a man so does god's power stay with him 420 an old man said when you wake in the morning tell yourself this work my body for your food be earnest my soul to win your inheritance 9 43 a brother said to an old man i see no battle in my heart and the old man said you are like double doors anyone who likes can go inside and come out again when he likes and you are unaware of what is happening if you had a door and shut it you would not let wicked thoughts come in and then you would see them standing outside the door and fighting against you 44 they said of an old man that his thoughts suggested to him let be today tomorrow you shall do penance and he contradicted them thus no i do penance today and to morrow the lord's will be done 45 an old man said unless the inner man live soberly the outer man is uncontrollable 46 an old man said satan has three powers which lead to all the sins the first is forgetfulness the second negligence the third concupiscence if forgetfulness comes it begets negli gence negligence is the mother of concupiscence and by concupiscence a man falls if the mind is serious it repels forgetfulness negligence does not come concupiscence finds no entry and so with help from christ's grace he shall never fall 47 an old man said take care to be silent empty the mind attend to your meditation in the fear of god whether you are resting in bed or at work if you do this you will not fear the assaults of demons 48 an old man said to a brother the devil is like a hostile neighbour and you are like a house the enemy con tinually throws into you all the dirt that he can find it is your business not to neglect to throw out whatever he throws in if you neglect to do this your house will be so full of mud that you will not be able to walk inside from the moment he begins to throw put it out again bit by bit and so by christ's grace your house shall remain clean 49 an old man said when the donkey's eyes are covered it walks round the mill wheel if you uncover its eyes it will not go on walking in the circle and if the devil succeeds in covering a man's eyes he lowers him into every kind of sin but if man's eyes are uncovered he can more easily escape i4o western asceticism 50 the old men used to say that on the mountain of abba antony seven monks took turns at the time of the grape harvest to drive away the birds from the fruit one old man among them on the day when it was his turn to guard the grapes used to shout go away ill thoughts within birds without 5 1 a brother collected palm leaves in his cell and as soon as he sat down to plait them his mind suggested to him that he should go visit one of the old men he meditated on it and said i will go in a few days and then his mind suggested suppose he dies during the next few days what will you do i will go now and talk with him because it is summer time and again he thought no it is not the proper time yet then he said it will be time when you have cut the reeds for the mats and he said i will spread out these palm leaves and then go then he said but today it is fine weather so he rose left his pile of palms took his cloak and went out but nearby was another old man a man of prophetic vision when he saw the brother hurrying out he called to him prisoner prisoner where are you running to gome here to me he came and the old man said to him go back to your cell the brother described to him the ups and downs and indecisions of his mind and then went back to his cell and as soon as he entered it he fell down and did penance and suddenly the demons shrieked aloud you have conquered us monk you have conquered us and the mat on which he lay was singed as though by fire and the demons vanished away like smoke and so the brother learnt their wiles 52 they told a story of an old man who was dying in scete the brothers stood round his bed and clothed him and began to weep but he opened his eyes and began to laugh it hap pened three times so the brothers asked him tell us abba why do you laugh at our weeping and he told them i laughed the first time because you fear death i laughed the second time because you are not ready for death i laughed the third time because i am passing from labour to rest and yet you weep and so saying he closed his eyes and died 53 a brother who was living in his cell once came to one of the fathers and said that he was grievously troubled by his thoughts and the old man said you have thrown on the ground a mighty weapon which is the fear of god and taken in your hand a stick made of reeds which is wicked thoughts you must take to yourself the fire which is the fear of god the sayings of the fathers 14 and when the wicked thought approaches you the fear of god will destroy it as a fire burns reeds wickedness cannot over come men who fear god 54 one of the fathers said unless you first hate you cannot love unless you hate sin you cannot live righteously as it is written eschew evil and do good 48 but mental purpose is needed for all this adam though in paradise dis obeyed god's command job living in a dung hill kept it it seems that god requires from man a good purpose the purpose of fearing him always part xii that we ought to pray earnestly and unceasingly 1 they said of abba arsenius that on saturday evening he put his back to the setting sun and stretched out his hands towards heaven and prayed until at dawn on sunday the rising sun lit up his face and then he sat down again 2 the brothers asked abba agatho father which virtue in our way of life needs most effort to acquire and he said to them forgive me i think nothing needs so much effort as prayer to god if a man is wanting to pray the demons infest him in the attempt to interrupt the prayer for they know that prayer is the only thing that hinders them all the other efforts of a religious life whether they are made vehemently or gently have room for a measure of rest but we need to pray till we breathe out our dying breath that is the great struggle 3 abba dulas the disciple of abba bessarion said i once went into the cell of my abba and found him standing in prayer with his hands stretched towards heaven he stayed like that for fourteen days at the end he called me and said follow me we went out and took our way through the desert i grew thirsty and said to him abba i am thirsty he took off his cloak and went away a stone's throw and he prayed and brought me the cloak full of water and we went to the city of lycus and came to abba john and greeted him and prayed then they sat down and began to talk about a vision which they had seen abba bessarion said the lord has given a commandment that the temples be destroyed and so it was done they were destroyed 4 abba evagrius said if your soul grows weak pray as 48 ps 37 27 142 western asceticism it is written 49 pray in fear and trembling earnestly and watchfully we ought to pray like that especially because our unseen and wicked enemies are vehemently trying to hinder us 5 5 he also said when a contrary thought enters the heart do not cast around here and there in your prayer but be simply penitent and so you will sharpen your sword against your assailant 6 epiphanius of holy memory the bishop from cyprus was told this by the abbot of his monastery in palestine by your prayers we have kept our rule we carefully observe the offices of terce sext none and vespers but epiphanius rebuked him and said then you are surely failing to pray at other times the true monk ought to pray without ceasing ought always to be singing psalms in his heart 7 abba isaiah said a priest at pelusium was holding a love feast and while the brothers in church were eating and conversing he rebuked them thus e be silent my brothers i know of one brother who is supping among you and his prayer mounts in the sight of god like a darting flame 8 abba lot went to abba joseph and said abba as far as i can i keep a moderate rule with a little fasting and prayer and meditation and quiet and as far as i can i try to cleanse my heart of evil thoughts what else should i do then the old man rose and spread out his hands to heaven and his fingers shone like ten candles and he said if you will you could become a living flame 9 some monks called euchites 50 or men of prayer once came to abba lucius in the ninth region of alexandria and the old man asked them what work do you do with your hands and they said we do not work with our hands we obey st paul's command and pray without ceasing the old man said to them do you not eat they said yes we eat and the old man said to them when you are eating who prays for you again he asked them do you not sleep they said we sleep and the old man said who prays for you while you are asleep they would not answer him w later copyists removed

god's help i sit and collect a few palm leaves and plait them and say have mercy upon me o god after thy great mercy and according to the multitude of thy mercies do away with mine ini quity 51 and he said to them is that prayer or is it not they said it is prayer and he said when i stay all day working and praying in my heart i make about sixteen pence two of these i put outside the door and with the rest i buy food and he who receives the two pennies outside the door prays for me while i am eating and sleeping and so by god's grace i fulfil the text tray without ceasing 10 some brothers asked abba macarius how should we pray and the old man said there is no need to talk much in prayer spread out your hands often and say c lord have mercy upon me as thou wilt and as thou knowest but if war presses into the soul say lord help me 9 he knows what is best for us and has mercy 1 1 they said of abba sisois that unless he soon lowered his hands when he stood up to pray his mind was snatched up into the heavenly places so if he happened to be praying with another brother he quickly lowered his hands and ended the prayer so that his mind should not be rapt or remain in prayer too long for his brother 12 an old man used to say constant prayer soon cures the mind 13 one of the fathers said no one can see his face re flected in muddy water and the soul cannot pray to god with contemplation unless first cleansed of harmful thoughts 14 an old man once visited mount sinai and when he was going away a brother met him by the path and groaned and said abba we are afflicted by drought there has been no rain and the old man said why do you not pray and ask god and he said we have been praying and asking god constantly and still there is no rain and the old man said i believe you are not praying intently enough shall we try whether it is so come let us stand and pray together he stretched out his hands to heaven and prayed and at once the rain fell the brother was afraid at the sight and fell down and worshipped him but the old man fled away from that place 51 ps 51 1 144 western asceticism 15 the brothers told this story we once visited some old men and after the usual prayer we exchanged greetings and sat down and after we had talked together we made ready to go and asked once again for prayer to be made but one of the old men said to us what have you not prayed already and we said yes father when we came in we prayed and since then we have been talking and he said forgive me brothers one brother while he was sitting and talking with you offered a hundred and three prayers ajad with these words he prayed and sent us away part xiii that we ought to be hospitable and show mercy with cheerfulness 1 some of the fathers once came to abba joseph in pane physis to ask him if they should break their fast when they re ceived brothers as guests and so could celebrate their coming and before they asked their question the old man said to his disciple meditate on what i am going to do today and he put two seats made of reeds tied in bundles one on his left and the other on his right and said sit down then he went into his cell and put on rags and he came out and walked past them and then went in again and put on his ordinary clothes the visitors were astonished and asked him what it meant he said to them did you see what i did they said yes and he said did the rags change me for the better they said no he said did the good garment change me for the worse they said no and he said so i am myself whether i wear good clothes or rags i was not changed for better or worse because i changed my clothes that is what we ought to do in receiving guests it is written in the holy gospel render unto caesar the things that are caesar's and unto god the things that are god's so when visitors come we ought to welcome them and celebrate with them when we are by our selves we need to be sorrowful when they heard it they were astonished that he knew what they intended to ask him and they glorified god 2 abba cassian said 52 we came from palestine to egypt and visited one of the fathers after he had offered us hospital ity we asked him why when you receive guests do you not keep the fast in palestine they keep it he answered fasting is ever with me i cannot keep you here for ever fasting is 52 institutes v 24 the sayings of the fathers 145 useful and necessary but we can choose to fast or not fast god's law demands from us perfect charity in you i receive christ and so i must do all i can to show you the offices of charity when i have bidden you farewell i can return and make up my rule of fasting the sons of the bridegroom cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them when he is taken from them then they can fast 53 3 abba cassian also said 54 we came to another old man and he invited us to sup and pressed us though we had eaten to eat more i said that i could not he answered c i have already given meals to six different visitors and have supped with each of them and am still hungry have you only eaten once and yet are so full that you cannot eat with me now 4 in scete there once went out an order that they should fast that week and then celebrate easter during the week some brothers happened to come from egypt to visit abba moses and he cooked a little vegetable stew for them the nearby hermits saw the smoke and said to the clergy of the church what is that smoke moses must be disobeying the order and cooking stew in his cell the clergy said we will talk to him when he comes on saturday the clergy who knew the greatness of his way of life said to abba moses in front of the whole congregation abba moses you have broken a commandment of men but you have mightily kept the com mandments of god 5 a brother came to abba poemen in the second week of lent and told him his thoughts and found peace of mind from his answer then he said i was almost stopped from coming to see you today and the old man said why and he said i was afraid that the door would not be opened as it is lent and abba poemen answered him we were not taught to shut wooden doors the door we need to keep shut is the mouth 55 6 a brother said to abba poemen if i give my brother anything like a piece of bread the demons pollute the gift for it makes it seem to be done to please men and the old man told him even if it is done to please men we still ought to give our brothers what they need and he told him this parable there were in a town two farmers one of them sowed seed 53 matt 9 15 54 institutes v 25 55 in latin a pun non januam ligneam lineam mb scd linguae januam but the greek had no pun cf apophthegmata poemen 27 pg 65 col 335 146 western asceticism and gathered a poor harvest the other was idle and did not sow and had no harvest to gather if famine came which of them would survive and the brother answered the one who sowed even if the harvest was poor and the old man said it is so with us we sow a few seeds and they are poor but in a time of famine we shall not die 7 a brother came to a hermit and as he was taking his leave he said forgive me abba for hampering you in keep ing your rule the hermit answered my rule is to welcome you with hospitality and to send you on your way in peace 8 a hermit possessed of much virtue lived not far from a community of monks some visitors to the community happened to go to see him and made him eat though it was not the proper time later the monks of the community said to him were you not disturbed abba and he answered i am disturbed when i do my own will 9 an old man in syria they said lived near the way to the desert and it was his work faithfully to refresh every monk who came from the desert at whatever time he came one day a hermit arrived and was asked by him to sup but the hermit refused saying i am fasting the old man was grieved and said i beseech you do not pass by your servant do not scorn me come let us pray together look here is a tree let us obey him for whom the tree bows down when he kneels and prays so the hermit knelt and prayed but nothing happened then the old man knelt down and at once the tree bent its trunk as he did they rejoiced at the sight and gave thanks to god who is ever performing marvels 10 two brothers once came to an old man whose custom it was not to eat every day when he saw them he greeted them gladly and said a fast has its reward and he who sups from a motive of charity obeys two commandments he leaves his self will and refreshes his brothers 11 an old man in egypt lived in a desert place and far away lived a manichaean who was a priest at least was one of those whom manichaeans call priests while the manichaean was on a journey to visit another of that erroneous sect he was caught by nightfall in the place where lived this orthodox and holy man he wanted to knock and go in and ask for shelter but was afraid to do so for he knew that he would be recognized as a manichaean and believed that he would be refused hospitality but driven by his plight he put the thought aside and knocked the sayings of the fathers 147 the old man opened the door and recognized him and he welcomed him joyfully made him pray with him gave him supper and a bed the manichaean lay thinking in the night and marvelling why was he not hostile to me he is a true servant of god and at break of day he rose and fell at his feet saying henceforth i am orthodox and shall not leave you and so he stayed with him 12 a monk of the thebaid received from god the grace of ministry to minister to the poor as they had need in a village once he happened to be holding a love feast and a woman clad in tatters came up to him to receive her share when he saw the tatters he meant to take a great handful so as to give her a big helping but his hand was kept nearly shut and he took little another well dressed woman came up and seeing her clothes he meant to take a little handful for her but his hand was opened and he took a big helping so he made enquiry about the women and he found that the well dressed woman had been a lady who had sunk to poverty and clothed herself well because she felt that she had a standard to maintain before her family but the other had put on tatters so as to receive more 13 a monk had a poor brother living in the world to whom he gave all the profit from his work but the more he gave him the poorer he became so the monk went and told an old man what was happening the old man said to him if you take my advice you will give him nothing more but will tell him brother i have given you what i had it is yours to work now and give me of the produce accept whatever he brings you and give it to any poor pilgrim or old man whom you find and ask them to pray for him the monk listened to the advice and did so when his brother from the world came he spoke to him as the old man advised and his brother went away grieved and then the next day he brought the monk a few vegetables from the garden the monk accepted them and gave them to some old men asking them to pray for his brother he received a blessing from them and returned home later his brother brought him vege tables and three loaves of bread and he accepted it and gave it and again received a blessing but the third time his brother brought costly articles wine and fish the monk was astonished at the sight and called in poor men and fed them but he said to his brother from the world do you not need all that bread and his brother said no lord when i used to 148 western asceticism accept presents from you it was as though a fire entered into my house and consumed it but now while i am receiving nothing from you i have plenty and god blesses me so the monk went and told the old man what had happened and the old man said to him do you not know that the monks work is a fire which consumes wherever it passes it is best for your brother that he should eke out a pittance from his own effort and be prayed for by holy men then he receives god's blessing and he will have plenty 14 one of the old men said there are some who do good yet the devil insinuates a mean spirit into their souls so that they lose the reward of all the good that they do when i was once living in oxyrhynchus with a priest who was generous in almsgiving a widow came to ask him for a little barley he said to her c go and fetch a measure and i will weigh you some 3 she brought a measure but he weighed the measure in his hand and said it is too big and he made the widow ashamed after she had gone i said triest did you lend barley to that widow or what he said no i gave it her but i said if you wanted to make her a free gift why were you so exact about the measure and made her ashamed 15 an old man lived a common life with another brother and he was an old man with a merciful disposition once in a time of famine people began to come to his door to take part in a love feast and the old man ministered bread to everyone who came but when his brother saw this he said give me my share of the bread and do what you like with your share the old man divided the bread into two and went on giving away his own share as usual but a multitude flocked to the old man hearing that he gave to all comers and god seeing his purpose blessed that bread but the brother who had taken his share gave none away and he ate up his bread and said to the old man i have only a little of my bread left abba so take me back to a life in common aiid the old man said to him i will do whatever you want and again they began to live together and have everything in common again they had plenty of food and again the needy kept coming to receive a love feast one day the brother happened to go in and see that there was no bread left and a poor man came asking for the love feast so the old man said to the brother give him some bread and he said there is none left father and the old man said go in and look for some the brother went in the sayings of the fathers 149 and saw the bin full of loaves he was afraid at the sight and took some and gave to the poor man and he recognized the faith and goodness of the old man and glorified god part xiv of obedience 1 abba arsenius of blessed memory once said to abba alexander when you have finished your palm leaves come and have supper with me but if pilgrims come eat with them abba alexander worked away gently and unhurriedly and at supper time he had not finished his palm leaves wanting to obey the old man's order he went on hungry until he had finished the palm leaves abba arsenius saw that he was late and had his own supper for he thought that perhaps pilgrims had come and he was eating with them abba alexander finished his task and in the evening came to abba arsenius and abba arsenius said to him did pilgrims visit you and he said no and abba arsenius said then why did you not come and he answered because you told me come when your palm leaves are finished i kept your word in mind and did not come and have only just now finished the work and the old man admired the exactness of his obedience and said to him you should lay aside your work sooner so as to make your psalmody and fetch water for yourself otherwise your body will soon grow weak 2 abba abraham came to abba ares and while they were sitting together a brother came and said to abba ares tell me what must i do to be saved and the old man said go away eat bread and salt every evening for a whole year and come back and i will talk to you so the brother went away and did so and at the end of a year came again to abba ares by chance abba abraham was again with him this time abba ares said to the brother go away fast for a year and eat every second day when he had gone abba abraham said to abba ares why when you put a light yoke on all the brothers have you laid such a grievous burden on this brother and the old man said to him other brothers come to ask questions and go away as they came but this brother comes to hear a word for god's sake and he is a mighty labourer of god who takes the greatest trouble to do whatever i tell him that is why i speak to him the word of god 150 western asceticism 3 they told this story of abba john the short he went to an old man from the thebaid who was living in the desert of scete his abba once took a dead stick and planted it and told him pour a jug of water over its base every day until it bears fruit water was so far from their cell that he went away to fetch it every evening and did not return until dawn at the end of three years the stick turned green and bore fruit the old man picked some of the fruit and took it to church and said to the brothers take and eat the fruit of obedience 56 4 they said of abba john the disciple of abba paul that he was a man who possessed the virtue of obedience in great measure there was a tomb in which lived a dangerous lioness the old man saw the dung of the lioness lying round and said to abba john go fetch that dung and abba john said to him and what am i to do abba about the lioness the old man smiled and said if she comes at you tie her up and bring her here so the brother went there in the evening and the lioness rushed out at him he obeyed the old man's word and ran at her to catch her the lioness turned and fled abba john chased her shouting wait my abba told me to tie you up and he caught her and tied her up the old man sat a long time waiting for him and was greatly troubled in his mind because he was late but at last he came and brought the lioness with him tied the old man marvelled at the sight but wanting to humble him he beat him and said you fool have you brought me a silly dog and the old man immediately untied her and drove her away 5 they said that abba silvanus had a disciple in scete named mark who possessed in great measure the virtue of obedience he was a copyist of old manuscripts and the old man loved him for his obedience he had eleven other disciples and they were aggrieved that he loved mark more than them when the nearby old men heard that he loved mark above the others they took it ill one day they visited him abba silvanus took them with him and went out of his cell and began to knock on the door of each of his disciples saying brothers come out i have work for you and not one of them appeared immediately then he came to mark's cell and knocked saying mark and as soon as mark heard the voice of the w the same story is to be found in cassian institutes iv 24 and sulpidius severus dialogues i 19 each tradition of the story appears to be inde pendent of the others the sayings of the fathers 151 old man he came outside and the old man sent him on some errand so abba silvanus said to the old men where are the other brothers and he went into mark's cell and found a book which he had just begun to write and he was making the letter o and when he heard the old man's voice he had not finished the line of the o and the old men said truly abba we also love the one whom you love for god too loves him 57 6 once the mother of mark with many attendants came to see him she said to the old man when he went out to receive her abba tell my son to come out to me so that i can see him the old man went into mark's cell and said to him go out so that your mother can see you mark was clad in a torn piece of sackcloth patched with rags and his head and face were sooty from smoke of the cooking fire he came out obediently but closed his eyes and so greeted his mother and her attendants saying i hope you are well and none of them not even his mother knew who he was again she sent a message to the old man saying abba send me my son so that i may see him and he said to mark did i not tell you to go out so that your mother could see you and mark said to him i went out as you said father but i beg you do not give me that order again for i am afraid of seeming disobedient to you the old man went out and said to his mother your son is the man who came out and greeted you with c i hope you are in good health and he comforted her and sent her on her way 7 four monks once came from scete to abba pambo clothed in tunics of skin and each described the goodness of one of the others though not in his presence one of them fasted much one of them owned nothing the third was a man of great charity and they said of the fourth that he had lived in obedience to the elders for twenty two years abba pambo answered i tell you this last is a greater virtue than the others each of you others has to use his own will to keep his virtue but he eradicates his self will and makes himself the servant of another's will men like that if they persevere till death are confessors 8 there once came to abba sisois of the thebaid a man who wanted to become a monk and the old man asked him have you any ties in the world and he said cc i have a son and the old man said to him go and throw him in the river and 5 7 gassian knew the story cf institutes iv 12 and rule ofst benedict 9 5 152 western asceticism then you would be a monk he went away to throw his boy into the river but the old man sent a monk to stop him he was already holding his son ready to throw him in when the brother said stop what are you doing and he said the abba told me to throw him in and the brother said now the abba says do not throw him in so he left his son and came to the old man and became a monk of high worth tested through obedience 58 9 saint syncletice said i reckon that for coenobites obedi ence is a higher virtue than continence however perfect con tinence carries pride with it obedience has the promise of due humility 10 she also said we ought to rule our souls with dis cretion and to remain in the community not following our own will nor seeking our own good we are like exiles we have been separated from the things of the world and have given ourselves in faith to the one father we need nothing of what we have left behind there we had reputation and plenty to eat here we have little to eat and little of everything else 11 abba hyperichius said the monk's service is obedi ence he who possesses it shall have his prayers answered and shall stand by the crucified in confident faith for that was how the lord went to his cross being made obedient even unto death 12 the old men said if a man trusts another man and makes himself his servant he ought not to think about god's commandments but give himself completely to obey the will of his spiritual father if he obeys him in everything he will not sin against god 13 the old men used to say god demands this of chris tians to obey the inspired scriptures which contain the pattern of what they must say and do and assent to the teaching of the orthodox bishops and fathers 14 a brother from scete was going to harvest and he turned to a great old man and said tell me abba what am i to do for i go to harvest the old man said to him if i tell you will you do as i say the brother answered yes i will obey you the old man said if you do what i say you will rise and give up your harvesting and come here and i will tell you what to do so the brother abandoned his harvesting and came to the 58 cassian knew a different version of the same story institutes iv 27 it was a common piece of desert homiletic the sayings of the fathers 153 old man the old man said go into your cell and stay there fifty days without a break eat bread and salt once a day at the end i will tell you what to do next and he did so and at the end came back to the old man the old man knew him for an earnest person and told him what sort of a person he ought to be in his cell and the brother went down to his cell and for three days and nights he lay prone upon the ground in peni tence before god then the thought came into his mind you are exalted you are a great man and so he took control of his thoughts and in humility called his sins to mind saying and where are all the sins i have done and if the thought rose in his mind that he had much neglected the command ments of god he said to himself i will offer god a little service and i believe that he will have mercy upon me so he conquered the spirits which sent wicked thoughts and the spirits appeared before him in a visible form and said you are troubling us he said to them why they said if we exalt you you are quick to be humble if we humble you you lift yourself on high 15 the old men used to say from those who have not long been converted to the life of a monk god demands no virtue so much as earnest obedience 1 6 an old hermit had a servant who himself lived on a nearby estate once it happened that because the servant did not come the hermit had not what he needed neither food to eat nor materials to work he was troubled at having neither means of work nor means of keeping alive and said to his disciple do you want to go to the estate and call here the servant who usually brings what we need and he answered i will do as you say but the old man would not yet give him an order to go for he did not dare to send the monk after they had suffered for a long time because the servant did not come the old man again said to his disciple do you want to go to the estate and bring him here and he answered i will do what you want the disciple was afraid that if he went down to the estate he would cause scandal but so as not to be dis obedient to his father he consented to go the old man said go and believe in the god of your fathers who will protect you in every temptation and he prayed and sent him on his way the monk came to the estate and enquired where the servant lived and found his house the servant happened to be away from the estate with all his family except a daughter 154 western asceticism when the monk knocked the daughter opened the door and when he asked her where her father was she urged him to come into the house and indeed tried to pull him inside he at first refused to go in but in the end she pressed him and succeeded in persuading him in then she flung herself about him and tried to seduce him to lie with her he felt lust rising in him and his mind in a turmoil and he groaned and called out to god lord for the prayers of my father give me liberty now as soon as he said it he found himself by the river on the path to the hermitage and so was restored unharmed to his abba 17 two men who were brothers in the worldly sense came to live in a monastery one possessed the virtue of self control the other the virtue of obedience each to a remarkable degree if the abba said to the second do this he did it if he said sup at dawn he supped at dawn and so he gained a reputation in the monastery for his obedient conduct but the other brother was pricked by the needle of envy against him and said to himself i will test whether he is so obedient he went to the father of the monastery and told him send my brother away with me and we will go somewhere else the abba sent them on their way and the ascetic brother wanted to tempt the obedient brother they came to a river infested by crocodiles and he said to him walk down into the river and cross he im mediately walked into the river and the crocodiles swam to him 3 and licked his body but did not hurt him and when his brother saw what happened he said gome out of the river on their journey they found a corpse lying by the wayside and the ascetic said to his brother if we had an old coat we could put it over the corpse and he answered we had better pray perhaps he will live again and when they had stood in earnest prayer the dead man stood up the ascetic brother was proud and said this dead man has been raised because i am so self controlled but god revealed what had happened to the abba of the monastery how he had tempted his brother how the crocodiles had not hurt him and how the dead had been raised and when they came back to the monastery the abba said to the ascetic why did you do this to your brother the dead man was raised because he is so obedient 1 8 a man of worldly life who had three sons renounced the world and leaving his sons in the city came to a monastery the sayings of the fathers 155 after three years in the monastery he began to be much troubled in his mind by memories of the three sons and was very grieved for their sakes he had not told his abba of their existence the abba seeing him to be grieving said why are you sad he told him that he had three sons in the city and he wanted to bring them to the monastery the abba told him to bring them when he arrived at the city he found that two of them were already dead and only one survived he took him back to the monastery and looked for the abba but could not find him he asked the brothers where was the abba and was told that he had gone to the bakery he took his child in his arms and went to the bakery the abba saw him coming and greeted him and he took the child and hugged and kissed him then he said to the father do you love him he said yes and he said do you love him with all your heart he answered yes at these words the abba said then if you love him pick him up and throw him into the oven throw him now while it is red hot and the father took his son and threw him into the red hot oven and in that moment the oven was transformed and became as cool as the dew so the father received glory for an act like that of the patriarch abraham 19 an old man said a brother who entrusts his soul in obedience to a spiritual father has a greater reward than the brother who retires alone to his hermitage and he said one of the fathers saw a vision of four ranks in heaven the first rank was of men who are sick yet are grateful to god the second rank was of men who minister to them with willingness and generosity the third rank was of men who live in the desert and see no one the fourth rank was of men who for god's sake put themselves under obedience to spiritual fathers but the rank of the obedient men had a golden necklace and a crown and shone more than the others and i said to the being who showed me the vision how is it that the rank which is least shines the most and he answered hospitable men do what they themselves want hermits have followed their own will in withdrawing from the world but the obedient have cast away their self will and depend on god and the word of their spiritual father that is why they shine the most so my sons obedience is good if it is for god's sake strive to win at least some trace of this virtue it is the salvation of the faithful the mother of virtue the opening of the kingdom of heaven the raising of men from heaven to earth obedience 156 western asceticism lives in the house of the angels is the food of all the saints who turn to it at their weaning and by its nourishment grow to a perfect life part xv of humility 1 abba antony was baffled as he meditated upon the depths of god's judgements and prayed thus lord how is it that some die young and others grow old and infirm why are there some poor and some wealthy and why are the rich unrighteous and grind the faces of the righteous poor and a voice came to him antony look to yourself these are the judgements of god and it is not good for you to know them 2 abba antony said to abba poemen man's great work is to lay his guilt upon himself before god and to expect to be tempted to the end of his life 3 abba antony also said i saw all the devil's traps set upon the earth and i groaned and said who do you think can pass through them and i heard a voice saying humility 4 once some old men came to abba antony and abba joseph was with them abba antony wanting to test them began to speak about holy scripture and he began to ask the younger monks the meaning of text after text and each of them replied as he was able and to each the old man said you have not yet found it then he said to abba joseph what do you say is the meaning of this word he answered i do not know and abba antony said truly abba joseph alone has found the true way for he answered that he does not know 5 some demons were once standing near abba arsenius in his cell and were troubling him then some brothers came who usually ministered to him and as they stood outside the cell they heard him crying aloud to the lord lord do not leave me though i have done nothing good in thy sight grant me lord according to thy loving kindness at least the very beginning of a good life 6 they said of abba arsenius that while he was in the emperor's palace he was the best dressed person there and while he was leading the religious life no one was clothed in worse rags 7 abba arsenius was once asking an old egyptian for advice the sayings of the fathers 157 about his temptations and another who saw this said abba arsenius how is it that you who are so learned in the greek and latin languages come to be asking that uneducated countryman about your temptations he answered i have acquired the world's knowledge of greek and latin but i have not yet been able to learn the alphabet of this uneducated man 8 the old men said that they once gave the brothers in scete a few figs but because they had so few they did not give any to abba arsenius for fear he should be offended when he heard of this he did not go out as usual to the divine office with the brothers and said you have excommunicated me by not giving me the blest food which the lord sent to the brothers because i was not worthy to receive it and they were edified at his humility and the priest went and took him some of the figs and brought him back to the congregation happy 9 they used to say that no one could fathom the depth of his religious life once when he was living in lower egypt and suffering from importunate visitors he decided to leave his cell he took nothing with him and said to his disciples alexander and zoilus alexander you board a ship and you zoilus come with me to the nile and find for me a little boat that is sailing to alexandria and then sail to join your brother zoilus was troubled at this but said nothing and so they parted the old man went down to the country near alexandria and theie fell gravely ill but his disciples said to each other do you think one of us has grieved him and that is why he has separated from us they examined themselves but could not find that they had been ungrateful to him or that they had ever disobeyed him when the old man had recovered from his illness he said to himself i will go to my fathers and so he came to the place called petra where were alexander and zoilus his servants while he was by the river bank he met an ethiopian girl who came up and touched his cloak the old man rebuked her but she said if you are a monk go to the mountain the old man was stricken in heart at these words and said to himself arsenius if you are a monk go to the mountain and on the way his disciples alexander and zoilus met him and fell at his feet and the old man too threw himself on the ground and they all wept then the old man said did you not hear that i fell ill they said to him yes we heard and he said then why did you not come to see me and alexander 158 western asceticism said we were aggrieved at your parting from us for many people were vexed at it and said unless they had disobeyed the old man he would surely not have left them 3 and the old man said to them yes i knew this would be said but men shall say again the dove found no rest for his feet and so returned to noah in the ark the minds of his disciples were healed by the saying and they stayed with him to the end of his life but when he lay dying they were much distressed and he said to them the hour is not yet come but i will tell you when it comes you will be judged with me before the judgement seat of christ if you let anyone touch my dead body and they said what then shall we do we do not know how to clothe or bury a dead body and the old man said surely you know how to tie a rope to my leg and pull me up the mountain when he was soon to commit his soul to god they saw him weeping and said truly father are you afraid even you of death and he said truly the fear which possesses me now has been with me since i became a monk and i am very afraid so he slept in peace arsenius always used to say this why you words did i let you go out i have often been penitent that i spoke never that i kept silent when abba poemen heard that arsenius had departed this life he wept and said you are blessed abba arsenius for you wept for yourself in this world and he who does not weep for himself in this world shall lament for ever in the next we cannot escape lamentation if we do not lament here of our own will we shall later be forced to lament against our will 10 abba daniel said of abba arsenius that he never wanted to discuss any question about the scripture though he was wonderful at expounding it when he wanted and that he was very slow to write anyone a letter when from time to time he came to the meeting in church he sat behind a pillar so that none should see his face and he himself should be undistracted and like jacob he looked like an angel having white hair a man lovely to look upon yet somehow dried up he had a long beard which reached down to his waist his eyes were dim with constant weeping and although he was tall his body was bent for he died at the age of ninety five he lived for forty years in the palace of the emperor theodosius the great of holy memory the father of arcadius and honorius then he lived forty years in scete ten years in the place called trohe 3 above the sayings of the fathers 159 babylon near the city of memphis and three years in canopus near alexandria then he returned to trohe for two more years and there ended his life in peace and the fear of god he was a good man full of the holy spirit and of faith 59 1 1 abba john told this story abba anub and abba poemen and the others who were born of the same mother were monks in scete and some savage mazicae came and sacked scete the monks went away and came to a place called terenuthis while they discussed where to live and stayed a few days there in an old temple abba anub said to abba poemen of your charity let me live apart from you and your brothers and we shall not see each other for a week and abba poemen said let us do as you wish and they did so in the temple stood a stone statue and every day at dawn abba anub rose and pelted the face of the statue with stones and every day at evening he said forgive me every day for a week he did this and on saturday they met again and abba poemen said to abba anub i saw you abba throwing stones at the face of the statue every day this week and later doing penance to the statue a true christian would not have done that and the old man answered for your sakes i did it when you saw me throwing stones at the statue's face did it speak was it angry and abba poemen said no and he said when i did penance before the statue was it troubled in heart did it say c i do not forgive you and abba poemen answered no and he said here we are seven brothers if we want to stay together we must become like this statue which is un troubled by the injuries i have done it if you will not become like this statue see there are four doors to this temple and each of us may go in the direction he chooses at these words they fell upon the ground before abba anub and said to him as you say father we will do what you tell us and afterwards abba poemen described what happened we remained together all our lives doing our work and everything else as the old man directed us he appointed one of us as a steward and we ate whatever he put before us no one could have said bring something else to eat 9 or i will not eat that and so we passed our lives in quiet and peace 12 they said of abba ammon that some people asked him to arbitrate in their quarrel but the old man took no notice 39 acts 1 1 24 l6o western asceticism of them and one woman said to another woman standing next to her that old man is a fool and the old man heard what she said and he called her and said can you imagine what travail i have endured in different deserts in the effort to acquire this folly and you are making me lose it all today 13 there was a bishop of the city of oxyrhynchus named affy they said that while he was a monk he treated his body very severely and when he became a bishop he wanted to continue in his city the austerities which he had practised in the desert but he could not so he fell prostrate before god and said dost thou think my lord that thy grace has left me because i have become a bishop and it was revealed to him no in the desert you had no man to help you and god alone sustained you but now you are in the world and have men to help you 14 abba daniel said that in babylon there was a nobleman's daughter who had a devil her father sought out a monk and the monk said to him no one can cure your daughter except some hermits i know and if you go to them they will refuse to do it from motives of humility let us do this when they come bringing their produce for sale tell them that you want to buy what they have and when they come into the house to receive the money we will ask them to pray and i believe that your daughter will be healed so they went into the street and found a disciple of the old men who was sitting there to sell his baskets they took him back with them to the house as if to receive the money for his wares and when the monk had come into the house the girl who was troubled with the demon went up to him and slapped him and he followed the lord's commandment and turned her the other cheek the demon was forced out and began to cry violence the commandment of jesus christ is driving me out and so the girl was in that moment healed when they came to the old men they told them what had happened and glorified god saying the pride of devils cannot but fall before the humble obedience to the commandments of jesus christ 15 abba evagrius said the beginning of salvation is to contradict yourself 1 6 abba serapion said i have afflicted my body far more than my son zacharias and i cannot equal his humility or his silence 17 abba moses said to the brother zacharias tell me what to do and at the words zacharias threw himself at his the sayings of the fathers l6l feet saying why ask me father the old man said believe me my son zacharias i saw the holy spirit coming upon you and so i cannot but ask you then zacharias took his cowl from his head and put it beneath his feet and stamped on it and said unless a man stamps upon himself like that he cannot be a monk 1 8 abba poemen said abba moses asked the monk zacharias who was dying what can you see and he said nothing better than being silent father and abba moses said truth my son keep silent at the moment of his death abba isidore looked up to heaven and said rejoice my son zacharias for the gates of the kingdom of heaven are opened to you 19 theophilus of holy memory the bishop of alexandria once went to the mount of nitria and an abba of nitria came to him the bishop said what have you found upon your way father and the old man answered to blame myself un ceasingly and the bishop said this is the only way to follow 20 when abba theodore was supping with the brothers they received the cups with silent reverence and did not follow the usual custom of receiving the cup with a pardon me and abba theodore said the monks have lost their manners and do not say pardon me 21 they said of this abba theodore that after he was ordained deacon in scete he refused to minister in services but escaped to various places to avoid having to do so and the old men brought him back and said do not desert your ministry abba theodore said to them let me go and i will pray to god if he shows me that i ought to act as a minister i will do so and he prayed to god thus show me lord if it be thy will that i minister as a deacon and there appeared a pillar of fire from earth to heaven and a voice was heard saying if you can become like this pillar go and exercise your ministry when he heard this he determined never to exercise his ministry and when he came back to the church they did penance before him and said if you do not want to take part in the service at least hold the chalice but he re fused saying if you do not let me go i will leave this place altogether and so they left him 22 abba john the short said the gateway to god is humility our fathers endured much suffering and so entered the city of god with joy l62 western asceticism he also said humility and the fear of god surpass all the other virtues 23 abba john of the thebaid said the monk ought above all to be humble for this is the saviour's first commandment blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven 60 24 the brothers in scete were once assembled and began to discuss melchizedek the priest but they forgot to call for abba copres later they summoned him and asked him what he thought upon the question he struck his mouth three times and said woe upon you copres you have left undone what god commanded you to do and you have dared to enquire into things which he did not ask of you at these words the brothers fled each to his own cell 25 abba macarius once said of himself when i was a young man and was staying in my cell in egypt they caught me and made me a cleric at a village and because i did not want to minister i fled to another place and a man of the world but of a devout life came to me and took what i made with my hands and ministered to my needs it happened that a girl of the village was tempted by the devil and seduced and when she was seen to be pregnant she was asked who was the father of the child and she said c lt was this hermit who slept with me 5 they came out arrested me and brought me back to the village and they hung dirty pots and jug handles on my neck and made me walk round the vil lage beating me as i went and saying this monk has seduced our girl away with him away with him and they beat me until i was almost dead but one of the old men came and said c how long have you been beating that stranger monk the man who used to minister to my needs followed behind ashamed and they heaped insults on him saying you bore witness to this hermit and look what he has done the parents of the girl said that they would not let me go unless i found someone to guarantee her support i spoke to the man who used to minister to me and asked him to be my guarantor and he gave a pledge on my behalf i went back to my cell and i gave him all the baskets i had and said sell them and give my woman some food then i said to myself macarius you have found a woman for yourself you need to work much harder to support her so i worked night and day and passed her the money which i made 60 matt 5 3 the sayings of the fathers 163 when it was time that the unfortunate girl should bear a child she spent many days in travail and still did not bring forth the baby they said to her what's the matter she said i know why i am in agony so long her parents asked her why she said i accused that monk falsely for he had nothing to do with it the father is a young man named n the man who ministered to me heard this and came to me with joy saying the girl could not bear her child until she confessed that you had nothing to do with it and that she told lies against you and look all the villagers want to come to your cell and glorify god and do penance to you when i heard this i did not want the mefi to trouble me so i rose and fled here to scete and this was the reason why i began to live here 26 abba macarius was once returning to his cell from the marsh carrying palm leaves and the devil met him by the way with a sickle and wanted to run him through with the sickle but could not the devil said macarius i suffer much violence from you for i cannot overcome you for whatever you do i do also if you fast i eat nothing if you keep watch i get no sleep but it is only one quality in you which overcomes me and abba macarius said to him what is that the devil ans wered your humility that is why i cannot prevail against you 27 abba mathois once went from raythu to the country of gebalon and his brother was with him and the bishop of gebalon came to him and ordained him priest and at supper the bishop said forgive me abba i know that you did not want to be ordained but i dared to do it so that you would give me your blessing the old man said humbly my soul did not much want ordination it is true but i am grieved by the fact that i must be divided from my brother who is with me and by myself i cannot offer all the prayers which together we offer the bishop said if you know that he is a worthy person i will ordain him too abba mathois said whether he is worthy i do not know but one thing i do know that he is better than i am so the bishop ordained his brother too and neither of them when he died had offered the sacrifice at the altar the old man said i trust god that perhaps he will not judge me hardly for my ordination provided i do not dare to consecrate the offering for that is the duty of men who live innocently 28 abba mathois said the nearer a man comes to god 164 western asceticism the more he sees himself to be a sinner isaiah the prophet saw the lord and knew himself to be wretched and unclean 61 29 they said of abba moses that when he was ordained a cleric they put the pall on his shoulders and the archbishop said to him see you are clothed in white and ready for your ordination abba moses he answered white outside lord pope or white inside do you think the archbishop wishing to test him said to the clergy when abba moses comes to the altar turn him away but follow him and listen to what he says they began to drive him from the church saying get out ethiopian as he went out he said you thing of dust and ashes they have done you a good turn you are not a man how dare you remain in the company of men 30 while abba poemen was in a community he heard of abba nesteros and wanted to see him so he sent a message to his abba to ask him to let nesteros come to him but the abba did not wish it and refused a few days afterwards the steward of the monastery asked the abba to let him go to abba poemen so that he could tell him his thoughts his abba when he was giving him leave said to him take with you the brother nesteros whom the old man asked me to send him i did not dare to let him go alone and have put off sending him until now when the steward reached the old man he talked to him about his thoughts and the old man healed his mind by his answer then the old man turned to the brother and said abba nesteros how have you won this virtue that if there is trouble within the monastery you do not speak and remain serene the brother had to be pressed by the old man for an answer in the end he said forgive me abba when i first entered the community i said to my soul you and the donkey must be alike the donkey says nothing when he is beaten that is what you must do as you read in the psalm i am become as a beast before thee and i am always with thee 31 they told this story of abba olympius in scete he was a slave and each year went down to alexandria carrying what he had earned for his masters they met him and greeted him the old man put water in a basin and brought it to wash his masters feet but they said to him no father please do not put a burden on us he answered i confess that i am your slave and i am grateful that you have let me go free to serve 61 isa 6 ps 73 21 2 the sayings of the fathers 165 god yet i wash your feet and here is what i have earned but they refused to accept it and he said believe me if you will not accept my earnings i shall stay here and be your servant but they revered him and gave him leave to do what he wanted and they brought him back to the desert with honour and gave him what he needed to make a love feast on their behalf and henceforward was renowned in scete 32 abba poemen said a man ought ever to be absorbing humility and the fear of god as the nostrils breathe air in and out 33 a brother asked abba poemen how ought i to behave in my cell in the place where i live the old man answered be as prudent as a stranger and wherever you are do not expect your words to be powerful in your presence and you will find peace 34 he also said the tools of the soul are these to cast oneself down in god's sight not to lift oneself up and to put one's self will behind one 35 he also said do not put a value on yourself but cleave to the man who is living a good life 36 he also said a brother asked abba alonius what is lowliness and the old man said to be lower than brute beasts and to know that they are not condemned 37 he also said humility is the ground whereon the lord ordered the sacrifice to be offered 38 he also said if a man keeps his own place he shall not be troubled 39 he also said once when the old men were sitting down to supper abba alonius stood and waited on them and when they saw it they praised him but he said not a word so one of them whispered to him why do you not answer when the old men praise you and abba alonius said if i answer them i shall find pleasure in being praised 40 abba joseph told this story once when we were sitting with abba poemen he talked of abba agatho we said to him c he is a young man why do you call him abba and abba poemen said his speech is such that we must call him abba 41 they said of abba poemen that he never wanted to cap the saying of another old man but always praised what had been said 42 once theophilus of holy memory the archbishop of alexandria came to scete the brothers assembled there said l66 western asceticism to abba pambo say a word to the pope that his soul may be edified here and the old man answered if my silence does not edify him my speech certainly will not 43 a brother named pystus told this story seven of us hermits went to abba sisois who was living in the island of clysmatus and when we asked him to give us a word he answered forgive me i am an ignoramus but i once went to abba hor and abba athrem abba hor had been ill for eighteen years and i began to beg them to speak a word to me and abba hor said what have i to say to you go and do whatever you think right god is the god of the man who extracts from himself more than he can do and carries all by violence these men abba hor and abba athrem were not of the same province but there was much grace between them until they died abba athrem was a man of perfect obedience abba hor of great humility i spent a few days with them observing their virtues and i saw abba athrem do a wonderful thing someone brought them a little fish and abba athrem wanted to prepare it for his elder abba hor so abba athrem took a knife and cut into the fish but at that moment abba hor called him athrem athremp and he left the knife in the middle of the fish and did not finish the cut but ran to abba hor i was astonished at his obedience and that he did not say wait until i have cut the fish so i said to abba athrem where did you find this obedience and he answered me it is not mine it is that old man's and he took me and said come and see his obedience he cooked a piece offish badly intentionally so and put it in front of the old man abba hor ate it without saying a word abba athrem said is it good abba he answered very good then he brought him another piece very well cooked and said see i have ruined it abba by cooking it badly abba hor answered yes you have cooked it rather badly and abba athrem turned to me and said did you see his obedience and i left them and have tried as far as i could to practise what i saw all this was told the brothers by abba sisois one of us asked him of your charity speak us a word and he said the man who has limitless knowledge understands the scriptures perfectly another of us asked him what is pilgrimage father he answered keep silent and wherever you go say i am at peace with all men that is pilgrimage the sayings of the fathers 167 44 a brother once came to abba sisois on the mountain of abba antony and in their talk he said to abba sisois have you not yet attained the stature of abba antony father and the old man answered if i had a single thought like abba antony i should quite leap toward heaven like a flame but i know myself to be a man who can only with an effort bear his thoughts 45 the same brother asked him do you think satan per secuted the men of old as he persecutes us and abba sisois said more for now his doom has drawn nearer and he is troubled 46 some others came to hear a word from abba sisois and he said nothing to them but kept repeating forgive me they saw his baskets and said to his disciple abraham what are you doing with those baskets and he answered we sell them now and then the old man heard and said and so sisois eats now and then they were very edified at his humility and went away happy 47 a brother asked abba sisois i observe my own mind and i see that it is recollected and intent upon god and the old man said to him this is no great thing that your mind should be with god the great thing is to see yourself to be lower than every created being bodily toil will put it right and lead you on the way to humility 48 syncletice of blessed memory said as a ship cannot be built without nails a man cannot be saved without humility 49 abba hyperichius said the tree of life is lofty and humility climbs it 50 he also said imitate the publican to prevent yourself being condemned with the pharisee follow the gentleness of moses and hollow out the rocky places of your heart so that you turn them into springs of water 51 abba orsisius said 63 if you put a piece of unbaked tiling in a building with a river nearby it does not last a day if it is baked it is as good as stone so it is with the man with worldly wisdom who is not proved by the word of god as joseph was proved at his beginning to live among men is to be tempted often it is good that a man should know his weakness and not pick up too heavy a burden at first but men of strong faith cannot be moved take the life of saint joseph and see what grievous temptations he suffered and 6 in the syriac wallis budge paradise vol ii no 220 of arsenius l68 western asceticism in a country where there was no trace of the true worship of god but the god of his fathers was with him and kept him safe in every tribulation and he is now with his fathers in the kingdom of heaven let us then own our weakness and so struggle onward for it is hard for us to escape the judgement of god 52 there was an old hermit in the desert who said to him self that he was perfectly virtuous he prayed god and said show me what makes me perfect and i will perform it but god wanted to humble him and said go to that archi mandrite and do what he tells you god gave a revelation to the archimandrite before the hermit came and said a hermit is soon coining to see you tell him to take a whip and go and herd your swine the old man arrived knocked at the door and went in to the archimandrite they greeted each other and sat down the hermit said tell me what i must do to be saved and the archimandrite said will you do what i tell you and he said yes the archimandrite said take this whip and go herd the swine when those who knew the hermit and his reputation saw that he had gone to be a swineherd said do you see that hermit who had won so great a reputation look what he is doing he has gone mad and is troubled by a demon and is herding swine but god looked upon his humility and saw how he bore these insults with patience and told him to go back to his cell 53 a demoniac frothing terribly at the mouth struck an old hermit on the jaw and the old man turned him the other cheek the humility tortured the demon like flames and drove him out there and then 54 an old man said to a brother when a proud or vain thought enters you examine your conscience to see if you are keeping god's commandments if you love your enemies if you rejoice in your adversary's triumph and are grieved at his downfall if you know yourself to be an unprofitable servant and a sinner beyond all others but not even then must you think yourself to have corrected all your faults knowing that this thought alone in you shall undo all the other good you have done 55 an old man said to a brother do not measure your heart against your brother saying that you are more serious or more continent or more understanding than he but be obedient to the grace of god in the spirit of poverty and in the sayings of the fathers 169 charity unfeigned the efforts of a man swollen with vanity are futile it is written c let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall be in your spirit seasoned with salt and so dependent upon christ 55 64 56 an old man said he who is praised and honoured above his deserts suffers grievous loss he who receives no honour at all among men shall be hereafter glorified 57 a brother asked an old man is it good to be constant in penitence 5 and the old man answered we have seen joshua the son of nun it was when he was lying prostrate on his face that god appeared to him 55 65 58 an old man asked why we are troubled by demons answered because we throw away our armour humility poverty patience and men 5 s scorn 55 59 a brother asked an old man if a brother brings me talk from the world abba do you want me to tell him not to bring them to me 55 and the old man said no 55 the brother said why 55 the old man answered because we cannot stop ourselves doing the same we should find ourselves doing what we are telling our neighbour not to do 55 and the brother said then what is best 55 and the old man answered if we would keep silence that is enough for our neighbour as well 55 60 an old man was asked what is humility he answered if you forgive a brother who has wronged you before he is penitent towards you 55 61 an old man said in every trial do not blame another but blame yourself saying this has happened to me because of my sins 5 55 62 an old man said i never push myself up and walk above my station and am untroubled when i am put in a low place for all the time i try to pray god to strip me of un regenerate man 55 63 a brother asked an old man what is humility 5 and the old man answered to do good to them that do ill to you 5 and the brother said suppose a man cannot attain that standard what is he to do 5 the old man answered he is to run away and choose silence 64 a brother asked an old man what is the work of pilgrimage and he said i know a monk who was on pilgrimage and came into a church where a love feast was being held and he sat down to eat with the monks but some i cor 10 12 gol 4 6 josh 5 14 j7o western asceticism of them said who brought that man in here and they saic to him get out of here he rose from the table and went out but some of the others were grieved that he had been driver away and went outside and brought him back then someone asked him c how do you think you felt in your heart when yot were driven out and then brought back and he said i pui it in my heart that i was no better than a dog and a dog goe out when he is chased out and comes back when he is called 65 some people once came to an old man in the thebaid so that he might cure a demoniac whom they brought with them after the old man had been importuned for some time he said to the demon go out of god's creature the demor answered i will go but i ask you a question tell me who an the goats and who are the sheep and the old man said the goats are people like myself who the sheep are god alone knows and the demon shouted aloud at the words crying see i go out because of your humility and he went out al that moment 66 an egyptian monk was living in the suburbs of con stantinople 66 and when the emperor theodosius ii passed that way he left his train of courtiers and came unattended tc the cell the monk opened the door to his knock and at one recognized him to be the emperor but he received him as though he was one of the imperial guards after he had conu in they prayed together and sat down the emperor began tc ask him how are the fathers in egypt he answered the are all praying for your salvation the emperor looked round the cell to see if he had any food and saw nothing except a basket with a little bread and a flagon of water the monk said to him will you take a little supper and he put the bread in front of him and mixed oil and salt and gave hino to eat and drink the emperor said to him do you know who i am and he said god knows you who you are the emperor said i am the emperor theodosius the monk at once fell down before him and did humble obeisance the emperor said blessed are you for you have an untroubled life without thought of the world i tell you truly i was born an emperor and i have never enjoyed bread aad water as i have today i have supped with real pleasure and he began to do honoui to the monk but the old man went out and fled back to egypt s in vitae patrum iii 19 the narrator of this story is the sayings of the fathers iji 67 the old men said we are the more humbled when we are tempted for god knowing our weakness protects us but if we boast of our own strength he takes away his protection and we are lost 68 the devil appeared to a monk in the guise of an angel of lightj and said to him i am the angel gabriel and i have been sent to you but the monk said see whether you were not sent to someone else i am not worthy that an angel should be sent to me and the devil vanished 69 the old men said if an angel in truth appears to you do not accept it as a matter of course but humble yourself and say e l live in my sin and am not worthy to see an angel 70 they said of another old man that while he was under going temptation in his cell he saw the demons face to face and was contemptuous of them the devil seeing himself overcome came and showed himself saying i am christ the old man looked at him and then shut his eyes the devil said i am christ so why have you shut your eyes the old man answered i would not see christ in this life but in the next and the devil vanished at the words 71 the demons wanting to seduce an old man said to him would you like to see christ he said a curse be upon you and him of whom you speak i believe my christ when he said c lf anyone says to you lo here is christ or lo there do not believe him and they vanished at the words 72 they said of an old man that he went on fasting for seventy weeks eating a meal only once a week he asked of god the meaning of a text of the holy scriptures and god did not reveal it to him so he said to himself here i am i have worked so hard and profited nothing i will go to my brother and ask him just as he had shut his door on the way out an angel of the lord was sent to him and the angel said the seventy weeks of your fast have not brought you near to god but now you are humbled and going to your brother i have been sent to show you the meaning of the text and he ex plained to him what he had asked and went away 73 an old man said if anyone in humility and the fear of god orders a monk to do something the very word thus spoken for god's sake makes the monk ready and obedient to the command but if he gives the command because he wants to give a command if he sets himself up as an authority and seeks power over the monk and does not give a command in the fear of god god sees the secrets of the heart and does not 172 western asceticism let the monk obey the command everyone can see whether the work is done for god or whether it is an order of self will and desire for power an order from god is given with humility and gentleness an order given from a desire for power is given with anger and trouble of mind for it is of the devil 74 an old man said i would rather be defeated and humble than win and be proud 75 an old man said do not think little of your neighbour for you do not know whether god's spirit is in you or in him i tell you that your servant is your neighbour 76 a brother asked an old man if i live with other monks and see something wrong do you want me to speak out the old man said if some are older than you or your contem poraries you will have more peace of mind in keeping silent for you will make yourself at peace in the fact that you are putting yourself below the others the brother said to him what then am i to do father for the spirits trouble me the old man said to him if you are suffering about the matter give a piece of advice once with humility if they do not obey you leave what you have done in god's sight and he will comfort you for this is the way the worshipper of god should lay himself before god and not follow his self will but take care that your anxiety be of god yet as far as i see it is good to be silent for here silence is humility 77 a brother asked an old man what is man's way of progress the old man answered humility the more a man bends himself to humility the more he is lifted up to make progress 78 an old man said if anyone says forgive me and humbles himself he burns up the demons which tempt him 79 an old man said even if you have succeeded in the habit of keeping silent you are not to have it in you as though it was a kind of virtue but say c i am not worthy to speak 80 an old man said unless the miller blindfolded the donkey in the treadmill it would turn round and eat the corn and god has mercifully blindfolded us so that we cannot see the good that we do for then we should perhaps pat ourselves on the back and lose our reward that is why we are left for a time with ill thoughts so that as we see them we judge and condemn ourselves those very thoughts are the cloth which blindfolds and prevents the piece of goodness from being seen when a man accuses himself he does not lose his reward 81 an old man said i would learn rather than teach the sayings of the fathers 173 he also said do not teach too early or you will have less understanding during the rest of your life 82 an old man was asked what is humility he answered humility is a great work and a work of god the way of humility is to undertake bodily labour and believe yourself a sinner and make yourself the servant of all and a brother said what does it mean to be the servant of all the old man answered to be the servant of all is not to look out for the sins of others ever to look out for your own sins and to pray god without ceasing 83 a brother asked an old man tell me one thing that i may keep it and live by it and the old man said if you can suffer injury and endure this is a great thing above all virtues 84 an old man said he who bears scorn and injury and loss with patience can be saved 85 an old man said do not take much notice of your abba and do not often go to see him for you will get confidence from it and start to want yourself to be a leader 86 a brother 67 so took upon himself any charge that threatened his community that he even accused himself of fornication some of the monks who did not know the truth about his life began to murmur against him saying this man does much ill and no work the abba knowing the truth said to the brothers i want rather one mat with humility than all your mats with pride and to show by god's judge ment the kind of person the monk was he brought all the things which the monks had made and the mat made by the monk of whom they were complaining and he brought a lighted brand and threw it into the pile of mats all the mats were burnt except the mat of this monk which was untouched the brothers were afraid at the sight and did penance to him and thenceforth treated him as a father 87 an old man was asked how it was that some people said they had seen angels he answered blessed is he who always sees his own sin 88 a brother learnt that another brother was aggrieved at him and went to make satisfaction but the other did not open the door of his cell so he went to an old man and told him the circumstances and the old man said see that you have no reason which looks like a just reason in your heart for blaming your brother as though you would accuse him and justify yourself and so god would not touch his heart to open the door 67 vitae patrwn iii 29 gives him the name of eulalius 174 western asceticism to you i tell you this even if he has sinned against you keep it in your heart that you have sinned against him justify your brother rather than yourself and then god will put it into his heart to make peace with you and he told him the following story there were two devout men living in the world and after talking with each other they went out and became monks wanting to equal the precept in the gospel but not according to knowledge they castrated themselves as if it was for the sake of the kingdom of heaven the archbishop heard of it and ex communicated them they believed that they had done right and were indignant with the archbishop saying have we castrated ourselves for the kingdom of heaven and he ex communicates us let us go and persuade the archbishop of jerusalem against him they went and told everything to the archbishop of jerusalem and he said and i excommunicate you too 3 further aggrieved they went to the archbishop of antioch and told him everything and he excommunicated them likewise so they said let us go to see the patriarch at rome and he will vindicate us from all these others so they went to the pope of rome and put before him what the other arch bishops had done saying we have come to you as you are the head of all but he also said to them i excommunicate you and you are put out of the church then the excommunicated persons had no further excuse and said to each other these bishops defer to each other and reach agreement because they meet in synods let us go to that holy man of god epiphanius the bishop in cyprus for he is a prophet and takes no account of anyone's rank as they were approaching his city he received a revelation about them and sent to meet them saying do not enter this city then they recovered their right minds and said truly we are rightly blamed why then do we seek to justify ourselves even supposing the archbishops excommunicated us unjustly that cannot be true of this prophet for he has received a revela tion about us and they charged themselves with the great guilt of what they had done so god who sees men's hearts revealed to epiphanius the bishop that they had made them selves guilty for the truth's sake and so of his own initiative he sent and brought them back and comforted them and received them to communion he wrote to the archbishop of alexandria about them saying receive back your children for they have dojie penance in the truth the sayings of the fathers 175 the old man who told the story added this is a man's sanity and his obedience to god's will that he casts himself before god with confession of his sin at these words the brother obeyed his word and went and knocked on the other monk's door as soon as the other learnt who it was he spoke penitently and opened the door at once they kissed each other with sincerity and perfect peace was established 89 two monks brothers in the flesh lived together and the devil wanted to cause division between them the younger once lit a lamp and put it on the lampstand the demon playing his trick upset the lampstand and the elder was angry and beat his younger brother but the younger was penitent and said be patient with me brother and i will light it again and suddenly the power of the lord came and tortured that demon until break of day so the demon told his chief a pagan priest what had happened and the pagan priest went out and became a monk and from the start of his religious life he held to humility saying humility breaks the power of the enemy i know for i have heard them saying when we trouble the monks one of them turns to god and is penitent and so destroys our power part xvi of patience i the brothers said that abba gelasius 58 had a parchment book worth eighteen shillings containing the whole of the old and new testament the book was put in the church so that any monk who wished could read it but a travelling monk came to visit the old man and when he saw the book he coveted it stole it and went away the old man though he knew who the thief was did not give chase or try to catch him the thief went to a city and looked for a buyer he found a man who wanted it and began by asking him sixteen shillings for it the man who wished to beat him down said first give it to me so that i may show it to someone and get advice and then i will pay your price so the monk gave him the book for this purpose he took the book to abba gelasius to discover whether it was a good bargain and worth this high price he told abba gelasius the price that the seller was asking the old 68 vp iii 30 attributes this to anastasius in budge ii no 184 it is anony mous 176 western asceticism man said buy it it is a good bargain and worth that price so he went back to the seller but instead of doing what the old man had told him he said look i showed this book to abba gelasius and he told me it was too highly priced and not worth what you said 35 the thief said did the old man tell you nothing else he answered nothing then the thief said now i do not want to sell the book stricken in heart he went to the old man did penance and asked him to take the book back the old man did not want to accept it then the monk said unless you take it back i cannot have peace of mind and the old man said if you cannot have peace of mind unless i take it back i will take it back and the brother remained with the old man until his death and made progress by learning from his patience 2 at a meeting of the hermits in celka an abba evagrius spoke and the priest there said abba evagrius we know that if you were in your own country perhaps you would already be a bishop and ruling over many souls here you are like a stranger evagrius was stricken in heart at the words but serenely and without haste he bent his head looked at the ground wrote in the dust with his finger and said truly fathers it is so but as it is written i have spoken once and i will no more answer 69 3 the brothers surrounded abba john the short when he was sitting in front of the church and each of them asked him about their thoughts another old man flared up in envy at the sight and said abba john your cup is full of poison and abba john answered yes father it is but you have said this when you can only see the outside what would you say if you saw the inside 4 john the less of the thebaid a disciple of abba ammon ius was said to have lived for twelve years ministering to an old man who was ill and sitting on a mat near him but the old man was always cross with him and although john worked a long time for him he never said may it be well with you but when the old man was on his death bed in the presence of the elders of the place he held john's hand and said may it be well with you may it be well with you and the old man commended john to the old men saying this is an angel not a man 5 they said of abba isidore the priest in scete that if job 40 5 the sayings of the fathers 177 anyone had a monk sick or weak or insolent and wanted to drive him out he would say bring him to me and he took him and cured the soul by his patience 6 abba macarius when in egypt found a man who had brought a beast to his cell and was stealing his possessions as though he was a traveller who did not live there he went up to the thief and helped him to load the beast and peaceably led him on his way saying to himself we brought nothing into this world 70 but the lord gave as he willed so it is done blessed be the lord in all things 7 at a meeting of monks in scete the old men wanted to test abba moses so they poured scorn on him saying who is this blackamoor that has come among us moses heard them but said nothing when the meeting had dispersed the men who had given the insults asked him were you not troubled in your heart he answered i was troubled and i said nothing 8 paysius the brother of abba poemen loved a monk of his cell abba poemen did not like it so he rose and fled to abba ammonas and said to him my brother paysius loves some people and i do not like it abba ammonas said to him abba poemen are you still alive go sit in your cell and put it in your heart that you have been already a year in your grave 9 abba poemen said whatever travail comes upon you shall be overcome by silence 10 a brother who was hurt by another brother went to the theban abba sisois and said i want to avenge myself on a brother who has hurt me the old man begged him don't my son leave vengeance in the hands of god but he said i cannot rest until i avenge myself the old man said my brother let us pray the old man stood up and said o god we have no further need to think of thee for we take vengeance of ourselves the brother heard it and fell at the old man's feet saying no longer will i quarrel with my brother i beg you to forgive me 1 1 a man who saw a religious person carrying a corpse on a bed said are you carrying dead men go and carry the living 12 they said of a monk that the more bitterly anyone injured or assailed him the more he was well disposed to him for he said people like this are a means to cure the faults of serious men people who make them happy do their souls harm 70 i tim 6 7 job 1 21 178 western asceticism for it is written they that call thee blessed deceive thee 71 13 some robbers once came to the hermitage of an old man and said we have come to remove everything in your cell and he said take what you see my sons 35 so they took what they found in the cell and went away but they missed a little bag which was hidden in the cell the old man picked it up and gave chase shouting out my sons you missed this take it they admired his patience and restored everything and did penance to him and said to each other truly this is a man of god 14 some brothers came to a holy old man who lived in the desert and outside the hermitage they found a boy tending the sheep and using ill mannered words after they had told the old man their thoughts and profited from his reply they said abba why do you allow those boys to be here and do not order them to stop hurling abuse at each other the old man said believe me my brothers there are days when i want to order them but i stop myself saying if i cannot put up with this little thing how shall i put up with a serious temptation if god ever lets me be so tempted so i say nothing to them and try to get a habit of enduring whatever happens 15 there was a story that an old man had a little boy living with him and seeing him doing some unsuitable work he said don't do that the child disobeyed him the old man observing him to be disobedient washed his hands of his upbringing and let him do as he liked but for three days the boy kept shut the door of the room with the bread and let the old man go without food the old man did not say where are you or what are you doing out there a neighbour of the old man saw that the boy was late in bringing food he made a little stew and passed it to him through a hole in the wall of the cell and asked him to eat and he said to the old man why is that disciple of yours so long away the old man said when he has leisure he will come back 1 6 there was a story that some philosophers once came to test the monks one of the monks came by dressed in a fine robe the philosophers said to him come here you but he was indignant and insulted them then another monk came by a good person a libyan by race they said to him gome here you wicked old monk he came to them at once and they began to hit him but he turned the other cheek to them then 7i isa 3 12 the sayings of the fathers 179 the philosophers rose and did homage to him saying here is a monk indeed and they made him sit down in their midst and asked him what do you do in this desert more than we do you fast and we fast also you chastise your bodies and so do we whatever you do we do the same the old man answered we trust in god's grace and keep a watch on our minds they said that is what we cannot do and they were edified and let him go 17 an old man who had a proved disciple once turned him out in a fit of irritation the disciple sat down outside to wait and the old man found him there when he opened the door and did penance to him saying you are my father because your humility and patience have conquered the weak ness of my soul come inside now you are the old father and i am the young disciple my age must give way to your conduct 1 8 one of the old men said that he had heard holy men say that there are young men who show old men how to live and they told this story there was a drunken old man who wove a mat a day sold it in the next village and drank as much as he could with the money then a monk came to live with him and also wove a mat a day the old man took this mat as well sold it bought wine with the price of both and brought back to the monk only a little bread for the evening meal though this went on for three years the brother said nothing at the end of three jars the monk said to himself here am i with little enough bread and nothing else i will go away but then he had second thoughts and said to himself where can i go i will stay here and for god's sake continue with this common life and immediately an angel of the lord appeared to him and said don't go away we shall come for you tomorrow that day the monk begged the old man don't go anywhere today they will come to take me away at the time when the old man usually went out to the village he said to the monk they will not come today my son it is already late the monk used every argument to show that they would come and even while he was talking he slept in peace the old man wept and said i am sorrowful my son that i have lived in neglect for so many years and you through patience have saved your soul in so short a time and thence forward the old man became sober and serious 19 a brother who lived near a great old man is said to have entered his cell from time to time and stolen the contents 180 western asceticism though the old man saw him he did not abuse him but struggled to produce more than usual saying i believe that brother is in need and while he worked harder than usual he tightened his belt and ate less when the old man was on his death bed the brothers stood round him and he looked at the thief and said come here and touch me 5 and he grasped his hand and kissed it saying i thank these hands of yours my brother it is because of them that i go to the kingdom of heaven the thief was stricken with remorse and did penance and he became a true monk and followed the example of that great old man 20 72 there was a harlot named thais so beautiful that for her sake many people impoverished themselves her lovers used always to be quarrelling and several young men spilt their blood on her doorstep when abba paphnutius heard of it he took a secular dress and a gold shilling and set out to see her in one of the cities of egypt he gave her his gold shilling for the price of her sin she accepted it and said let us go into the house as he was about to he on the bed which was strewn with costly coverlets he beckoned her and said if there is an inner room let us go into it she said there is an inner room but if you are frightened of men no one comes into this outer room if you are frightened of god you cannot escape his eye any where to this the old man said do you know about god she answered i know about god and the kingdom of the next world and the future torment for sinners he said if you know this why have you destroyed so many souls and therefore will have to give account for theirs as well as your own when thais heard this she fell down at paphnutius feet weeping and said lay a penance upon me father i trust with your prayers to win forgiveness let me have three hours grace and i will come wherever you command and do what ever you tell me when abba paphnutius had appointed her a place to meet she collected all the presents she had won by her sins she took them into the city square and publicly burnt them crying come all you people who have sinned with me see how i am burning your presents the value of the pile was forty pounds when she had burnt it all she went to the appointed place he found for her a hermitage for maidens and put her in a 72 a later addition found in none of the manuscripts the sayings of the fathers l8l little cell he sealed the door and left a little window through which she could receive food and told the sisters of the convent to bring her a little bread and water every day when paph nutius had sealed the door and was going away thais said to him where father would you have me pour my water and he said in the cell you are worthy then she asked him how to pray to god he said you are not worthy to have god's name on your lips nor to stretch out your hands towards heaven for your lips are full of wickedness and your hands polluted you must simply sit down look towards the east and say this prayer again and again thou who hast fashioned me have mercy upon me after she had been shut there for three years abba paph nutius was moved with sympathy and went to see abba antony to ask him whether god had forgiven her sins or not abba antony learning all the circumstances summoned his disciples and told them to watch all night and persevere in earnest prayer that god would declare to one of them the answer for which abba paphnutius had come they all went apart and prayed continually and abba paul the chief disciple of saint antony suddenly saw a bed in heaven covered with precious coverlets and guarded by three maidens whose faces shone paul said to himself this is the gift of none but my father antony and a voice came to him it is not the gift of your father antony but of the harlot thais abba paul told what he had seen and abba paphnutius recognized the will of god returned to the hermitage where thais was shut and broke the seals on the door she asked him to let her stay shut in but he opened the door and said come out for god has forgiven your sins she answered i call god to witness that from the time i came here i have kept my sins in my mind's eye like a burden and i have kept weeping at the sight of them abba paphnutius said god has forgiven you not for your penitence but because you always kept in your mind the thought of your sins and he brought her out and she lived for only fifteen days and died in peace part xvii of charity i abba antony said now i do not fear god but i love him for love casteth out fear 73 73 1 john 4 18 i 2 western asceticism 2 he also said from our neighbour are life and death if we do good to our neighbour we do good to god if we cause our neighbour to stumble we sin against christ 3 abba ammon of nitria came to abba antony and said to him i see that i endure more than you how is it that your reputation is great among men and abba antony said it is because i love god more than you do 4 abba hilarion once came from palestine to abba antony on the mountain and abba antony said to him welcome morning star for you rise at break of day and abba hilarion said peace to you pillar of light for you prop up the earth 5 abba mark said to abba arsenius why do you run away from us the old man said god knows i love you but i cannot be with god and with men the countless hosts of angels have but a single will while men have many wills so i cannot let god go and come and be with men 6 abba agatho said i never went to sleep intentionally while i kept a grudge against anyone nor did i let anyone go away to sleep while he had a grievance against me 7 once when abba john was going up from scete with other monks their guide missed his way in the night the brothers said to abba john what are we to do abba to prevent ourselves dying in the desert now that this brother has missed the way the old man said if we say anything to him he will be grieved look i will pretend i am worn out and say i cannot walk and will lie here till daylight and they did so the others said we will not go on but will stay with you here they stayed there until daybreak so that they should not abuse the monk who had wrongly guided them 8 before abba poemen went to egypt there was an old man there with a great reputation but when abba poemen came up from scete with his monks the people left this old man in favour of abba poemen the old man was jealous and spoke ill of them when poemen heard this he was sad and said to his monks what shall we do for that old man these people have made us suffer by leaving that old man and visiting us who are nobody how can we heal his mind and he said to them make some supper and take a little jug of wine we will go and eat with him perhaps we shall be able to heal his mind so they took the bread which they had made ready and went to the old man's cell when they knocked his disciple answered the door and said who are you they said tell the abba that it is poemen the sayings of the fathers 183 who wants to be blessed by you 95 the disciple told the old man who returned the message go away i am busy but they persevered and said we will not go away until we have got the old man's blessing so seeing their perseverance and their humility the old man was stricken with remorse and opened the door to them they entered and supped with him while they were having supper the old man said truly i have heard less than the truth about you i see that you do a hundred fold more than i was told arid he became their friend from that moment 9 abba poemen said try so far as you can to do wrong to no man and keep your heart chaste to every man 10 he also said there is nothing greater in love than that a man should lay down his life for his neighbour when a man hears a complaining word and struggles against himself and does not himself begiu to complain when a man bears an injury with patience and does not look for revenge that is when a man lays down his life for his neighbour 11 abba pambo happened once to be travelling in egypt with some monks he saw some men from the world sitting down and said to them stand up and give a greeting and kiss the monks that you may be blessed for they often talk with god and their mouths are holy 12 abba paphnutius is said to have drunk wine seldom but once on a journey he happened upon a meeting place of robbers while they were drinking the chief of the robber band recognized him and knew that he would not drink wine he saw that he was tired out so he filled a cup with wine held a naked sword in his other hand and said if you do not drink i will kill you the old man knew that the robber chieftain was trying to obey the commandment of god and in his desire to help him he took the cup and dr nk then the robber chieftain did penance before him and said forgive me abba that i grieved you and the old man said to him i believe that because of this cup my god will have mercy upon you in this world and the next and the robber chieftain answered and i believe in god that henceforward i shall harm no one and the old man won over the whole band of robbers because for god's sake he let himself fall into their power 13 abba hyperichius said snatch your neighbour from his sins so far as you caw and refrain from condemning him for god does not reject those who turn to him let no word of 184 western asceticism wickedness towards your brother dwell in your heart so that you can say forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors 14 two monks were in cellia one of them was an old man and asked the younger let us stay together my brother the other said i am a sinner and cannot stay with you abba but he begged him yes we can stay together the old man had a clean heart and the younger did not want him to know that he sometimes fell to lust the monk then said let me go away for a week and we will talk about it again at the end of the week the old man came back and the younger wishing to test him said i succumbed to a great temptation during this week abba when i had gone to a village on an errand i lay with a woman the old man said are you penitent and the brother said yes the old man said i will carry half the burden of the sin with you then the brother said now i know that we can stay together and they remained together till death parted them 15 one of the fathers said if anyone asks you for some thing and you give it to him even if you are forced to give it let your heart be in the gift as it is written c lf a man forces you to go with him one mile go with him two 74 it means if you are asked for something give it with a willing heart 1 6 a monk is said to have made baskets and put handles on them when he heard another monk saying nearby what am i to do the trader is soon coming and i have no handles to put on my baskets so he took of the handles he had put on his own baskets and took them to the nearby monk saying i do not need these take them and put them on your baskets and he allowed the brother to finish his baskets but left his own unfinished 17 they said that an old man in scete who was ill wanted to eat a little new bread one of the experienced monks heard of it and he took his cloak put stale bread into it went to egypt chaiiged the stale bread for new and brought the new bread back to the old man when the brothers saw the new bread they were astonished the old man did not want to eat it and said it is the blood of this brother and the old men begged him saying for god's sake eat so that his sacrifice is not vain and so he ate it 18 a brother asked an old man there are two monks one stays quietly in his cell fasting for six days at a time and 7 matt 5 41 the sayings of the fathers 185 laying many austerities upon himself and the other ministers to the sick which of them is more acceptable to god the old man answered if the brother who fasts six days even hung himself up by his nostrils he could never be the equal of him who ministers to the sick 19 an old man was asked how is it that some struggle away at their religious life but do not receive grace like the old fathers the old man said because then charity ruled and each one drew his neighbour upward now charity is growing cold and each of us draws his neighbour downward and so we do not deserve grace 20 three monks once went to harvest and were given a big area to harvest but the first day one of them fell sick and returned to his cell of the two remaining one said to the other look brother our brother has fallen ill you work as hard as you can and i will do what little extra i can and we will trust god that by our sick brother's prayers we shall harvest his part of the field as well as finishing our own part so they harvested the whole area which they had been given and went to receive their pay and they summoned their brother saying gome brother take your money he said i have not harvested so i have earned nothing they said to him we finished the harvest through your prayers come and take your pay and there was fierce argument between them the one saying i will not take it because i have not earned it the others refusing to accept their pay unless he would take his share so they went off to a great old man to accept his judgement and the brother who had been sick said to him we three went to earn money by harvesting in a man's field when we came to the place i fell ill on the first day and returned to my cell and i could not har vest a single day with them and now they are forcing me saying c come brother take your pay for work you have not done but the other two said the truth is this when we arrived at the field we were given a big area to harvest if there had been three of us we might with the greatest difficulty have just finished the work but by the prayers of this our brother the pair of us harvested the field more quickly than three of us would have done so we say to him come take your pay and he will not the old man marvelled to hear them and said to one of his monks ring the bell in the brothers cells to gather them l86 western asceticism here when they had assembled he said to them come brothers and hear today a just judgement 33 and the old man told them the whole story and decided that the brother should receive his pay and do with it whatever he would and the brother went away grieved and weeping like a man who has been sentenced 21 an old man said our fathers had the custom of visiting the cells of new brothers who wanted to lead a solitary life to see if any of them was tempted by demons and had taken harm from his thoughts and if they found anyone who had taken harm they brought him to church a basin was filled with water then after they had all prayed for the one who was suffering under temptation all the monks washed their hands in the basin and then the water was poured upon the tempted brother and he was at once cleansed 22 two old men lived together for many years without a quarrel one said to the other let us have one quarrel with each other as is the way of men and the other answered i do not know how a quarrel happens and the first said look i put a tile between us and i say that's mine then you say no it's mine that is how you begin a quarrel so they put a tile between them and one of them said that's mine ajnd the other said no it's mine and he answered yes it is yours take it away and they went away unable to argue with each other 23 a brother asked an old man if i see a monk of whom i have heard as guilty of a sin i cannot persuade my soul to bring him into my cell but if i see a good monk i gladly bring him in and the old man said if you do good to a good brother it is little to him to the other give twofold for it is he who is sick 24 an old man said i never wanted a work to be useful to me while causing loss to my brother for i have this hope that what helps my brother will bring fruit to me 25 there was a brother who served one of the fathers the old man's body happened to be badly hurt and evil smelling pus flowed out of the wound the serving brother thought to himself get out of here you cannot bear the smell of the gangrene to quell the thought he took a bowl washed the wound and kept the water which he used and whenever he was thirsty he drank from it but the thought began to trouble him again saying to him if you will not go away at least do notdrink this pus the brother struggled away with endurance the sayings of the fathers 187 and went on drinking the washing water and god saw his charity as he ministered to the old man and god turned the washing water into the purest water and by some unseen means healed the old man part xviii of the sayings is of ecstasies and raptures and prophecies and wondrous visions such as this a brother went to the cell of abba arsenius in scete and looked through the window and saw him like fire from head to feet he was a brother worthy to see such sights and when he knocked the old man came out and saw the brother standing there in amazement and said to him have you been knocking long did you see anything and he answered no and after talking with him abba arsenius sent him on his way in the middle of part xviii is the division where it is believed that the deacon pelagius ceased to translate and the subdeacon john contin ued the work part xix is of the holy men who wrought signs for example a demoniac once came to scete prayer was made for him in the church and his demon could not be cast out because it was a powerful demon the clergy said to each other what shall we do to this demon nobody but abba bessarion can cast him out and if we ask abba bessarion he will not even come to the church this is what we will do he will come to the church at daybreak tomorrow before anyone else and we will make the demoniac sit in abba bessarion's seat and when he comes in we will stand in prayer and say abba wake up that brother 3 and they did so when the old man came at daybreak they stood in prayer and said abba wake up that brother and the old man said to the sufferer get up and go outside and at once the demon went out of him and he was made whole part xx is of the holy life of various men and contains a miscellany of stories some of which might from their subject have been included under one of the existing headings here is one example 5 abba sisois was once living alone pn the mountain of antony his servant wa slow in coming to him and for ten months ho did not see a single human being but walking one 188 western asceticism day on the mountain he found a tribesman herding beasts the old man said to him where have you come from and how long have you been here he said abba i have been eleven months on this mountain and you are the first person i have seen when he heard this the old man went back to his cell and struck himself and said look sisois you thought you had done something and you have not even done as much as that man from the world and it contains one of the most celebrated of the macarius stories 17 once when abba macarius was praying in his cell he heard a voice which said macarius you have not yet reached the standard of two women in that city on his arrival he found the house and knocked at the door a woman opened it and welcomed him to her house he sat down and called them to sit down with him then he said to them it is for you that i have taken this long journey tell me how you live a religious life they said indeed how can we lead a religious life we were with our husbands last night but the old man persuaded them to tell him their way of life then they said we are both foreigners in the world's eyes but we accepted in marriage two brothers today we have been sharing this house for fifteen years we do not know whether we have quarrelled or said rude words to each other but the whole of this time we have lived peaceably together we thought we would enter a convent and asked our husbands for permission but they refused it so since we could not get this permission we have made a covenant between ourselves and god that a worldly word shall not pass our lips during the rest of our lives when macarius heard it he said truly it is not whether you are a virgin or a married woman a monk or a man in the world god gives his holy spirit to everyone according to their earnestness of purpose part xxi is another miscellany in some early manuscripts mp there is a part xxii of various final sayings sententiae patrum but in spite ofdom wilmarfs

wisdom deign of thy great goodness to help and defend me guide my heart almighty god that i may remember thy presence day and night 3 ii the conferences of cassian introduction cassian had begun his career in a monastery in bethlehem though not the monastery presided over by st jerome he had then visited egypt for some un certain number of years more than seven probably ten or twelve and studied under various egyptian hermits and coenobites mainly near the nile delta and in scete like many others among the more educated greek speaking monks he was concerned in the origenist controversy of 399 401 which sharply divided the monastic world and soon found himself with other origenists seeking the support and patronage of the patriarch john chrysostom of constantinople with the fall of his protector he had to take refuge elsewhere and like other refugees he found his way to rome whether he ever returned to the east is not known when the visigothic leader alaric sacked rome in 410 many prominent men fled to provence and it is possible that the flowering of monastic life in provence and its surrounding islands from 410 onwards is connected with the circumstance that provence seemed a haven for refugees cassian was in a monastic house which he had founded in marseilles at least as early as 425 and probably for several years before that there as one of the rare persons in the west with expert and first hand knowledge of the egyptian monks he was in demand to instruct edify and inform the young gallic monastic houses castor bishop of the little town of apt forty miles north of marseilles was founding a monastery and asked cassian to give it both practical arrangement and spiritual ideals based upon the egyptian models the result was the institutes published about 425 426 these were followed by the conferences which purport to be the addresses of various ascetics 190 the conferences of cassian igi mainly hermits whom cassian interviewed during his stay in egypt just as the egyptians regarded the coenobium as the training school for those who could endure before the monk went out to the higher life of prayer possible in the desert solitudes so the institutes are designed like the rule of st benedict for the training school and the conferences for hermits or those who might be turning from the life in a community to the hermit life how far the conferences represent the actual words of the egyptian abbots in whose mouths gassian puts the addresses is still a matter of debate almost everyone allows that cassian who had been away from egypt for a quarter of a century touched them gave them his own framework many scholars think that each egyptian father talked upon the subject which cassian says he talked and substantially in the sense which cassian ascribes to him others with whom i agree think that not even the subjects can safely be attributed to the indi vidual authors whom he mentions but that the substance of the teaching is certainly egyptian teaching seen through cassian's later perspective he certainly believed that he was transmitting the authentic doctrine of the egyptian desert and there is no adequate reason for supposing him to be mistaken the latin of cassian is as far apart from the latin of the sayings of the fathers as it well could be the rugged stark often ungrammatical vigorous staccato of the apophthegmatists gives way to the smooth flowing rhetorical periods by a master of fifth century latin prose it is clear its meaning unmistak able but its expression has the amplitude part cloudiness part exuberance part delight in patterns and rhythms acquired from the rhetorical schools to put the apophtheg matists into english you sometimes need to expand the laconic epigram to put cassian into english you need to remember that the epithets of the fifth century have less than their full value that cassian's contemporaries constantly used a super lative or two superlatives where a simple epithet would have represented the meaning to translate the jejune aphorisms of the apophthegmatists is like abba john watering his dead stick until it burst into flower to translate the urbane reiterations of cassian you need a moderate use of the pruning knife to cut away some of the luxuriant foliage in order to see the fruit apart from the partial removal of a few superlatives or the ex clusion of what fowler calls elegant variation i have taken one other liberty occasionally cassian reinforces his point iq2 western asceticism with a string of scriptural quotations had he been writing in a modern manner he would have transferred these quotations to a footnote which is where they ought to be for they inter rupt the sense of what he is saying and are armoury to protect his argument against critics precisely the function of the modern footnote i have therefore transferred a small number of blocks of texts to footnotes these footnotes are given in quotation marks and this will show the reader that these are in cassian's original text so popular was cassian as reading matter in the medieval monasteries that the manuscript tradition is over abundant and work is still needed upon it but for most practical purposes the edition of m petschenig published in the vienna corpus volumes 13 and 17 i 886 8 is excellent and is certainly in dispensable i have followed his text and departed from it only i believe at one point where his apparatus seemed to provide the more likely reading the conferences of cassian the text conferences i io preface to the best of my slender ability i have now fulfilled the promise which i made to bishop castor in the preface to the institutes which i wrote with god's help about the rules of the monks and the cures for the eight chief sins i should much like to know what you and he think about the book after a sober examination of it and whether in putting into prose for the first time i believe a discussion of a subject so profound and so sublime i have succeeded in producing a work of value and interest to you and all the brothers in the community bishop castor was a man who above all others longed for saintliness and so in his charity and oblivious of the difficulty of the task and of my incompetence to fulfil it rightly he required me to write in the same way these first ten conferences of the best of all the fathers the hermits who used to live in the desert of scete but he has died and passed to be with christ and therefore i have thought it right to dedicate these conferences to you two bishop leontius and my brother helladius for one of you is castor's brother in blood relationship in the office of a bishop and above all in love for sacred study and so has the hereditary right to demand the payment of a debt incurred to castor the other has chosen the austere life of a hermit not like some out of personal presumption but following the law ful tradition of ascetic doctrine which he began to receive from the inspiration of god's spirit almost before he began to learn it consciously rather than search out his own way of life he has chosen to receive it from the regular teaching of the fathers just as i have taken my little boat into harbour and decided not to write any more i see an ocean opening out in front of 194 western asceticism me it is evidently my duty that i should however rashly set down on paper something about the way of life and the teach ing of those great egyptian saints before it is forgotten and my little boat has now to venture out among the perils of much deeper water than before for life in a hermitage is a finer life than that in a monastic community and the contemplation of god which is the continual aim of the hermits is a loftier life than the pursuit of the daily virtues which is the purpose of life in a monastic community it is therefore your duty to help me with your prayers i am going to treat this sacred subject as faithfully as i can but i ask you to pray that my boat may not sink amid these deep waters through mere clumsiness or in experience i pass now from the outward and visible life of the monk the subject of my earlier book to the invisible life of the inner man from the vocal prayers of the canonical office to the unceasing prayer which st paul commanded if anyone through reading my earlier work has won the allegorical name jacob got for him self by supplanting the sins of his flesh he may now learn the rules of the perfect life and win if i may so put it the merit and the name of israel which means the man who sees god and he will do it by receiving the doctrines of the fathers i am not inventing this teaching but simply passing on what i learnt and by contemplating the purity of god god deemed me worthy to see them and learn from them and live with them i ask you to pray that i may truly remember what they told me and may be given a ready tongue to tell it that i may be enabled to pass it on with the same completeness and in the same pious spirit as i received it and that i may be enabled to show you the men themselves who are in a measure inseparable from their way of life and to transmit their teaching by making them speak in the latin language i want to give the reader of these conferences as of the earlier book an emphatic warning if perhaps he thinks anything here impossible or very difficult because of his condition or his manner of life or habits he should not measure it against the limits of his own powers but against the worth and sanctity of the speakers he should first consider their earnestness and determination truly they were dead to the life of this world and had cut every string which tied them to it even their natural family feeling then he ought to remember the kind of place they lived in how they had their hermitages scattered over a great desert and were far removed from any company the conferences of cassian 195 of men and so they found their senses quickened and saw or uttered what perhaps will seem impossible to the ignorant and the uninitiated who know only their own ordinary manner of life but if the reader wants to judge them rightly and would test whether what they did is possible let him without further delay resolve to adopt their purpose and their earnestness as his own then he will find that what once seemed beyond human capacity is not only possible but most pleasant and now without further preface i come to their confer ences conference i first conference of abba moses on the monk's goal 1 i was staying in the desert of scete where are the hermits of highest repute and spiritual perfection i had as my com panion the holy abba germanus who had been my fellow warrior since the earliest days of my ascetic life first in the com munity at bethlehem and afterwards in the desert a friend so close sharing so intimately the same aims that people might say there was a single mind and a single spirit in our two bodies together we sought out abba moses to find him among the other hermits it was like looking along a bed full of fragrant flowers until we found the flower which smelt the sweetest as he was so eminent in the practice of virtue and in the art of contemplative prayer we asked him with a deep compunc tion of heart to give us words which would help us in our spiritual progress we had heard of his inflexible rule never to give instruction in the spiritual life except to persons who sought it in faith and heartfelt contrition for he was afraid that if he poured out the water of life indiscriminately to people who had no use for it or were hardly even thirsty he would cast his pearls before swine and would be liable to the charge either of boasting about his prowess or of betraying his trust in the end he consented to our importunities and this is what he said 2 all arts and sciences have some immediate goal or destination scopes and also an ultimate aim a telos the earnest student of each art willingly endures the hard work and peril and expense by looking towards the goal which he will ulti mately achieve the farmer in his ploughing suffers heat or frost and ice or rocklike soil and turns the ground again and again to clear it of brambles and weeds and make it as soft and ig6 western asceticism fine as grains of sand that is his immediate purpose his scopes his ultimate purpose is to gather a bumper harvest and so live without fear of starvation and grow wealthy when his barn is fulfilled he uses some of the crop as manure and is prepared to lessen his present stock in the expectation of future harvest merchants are not afraid of storm and tempest because they are carried onward by the hope of gain ambitious soldiers think nothing of far journeys hardships and risk of life in battle because they have their eyes set upon the goal of power and place and will endure anything to obtain it the hermit in the same way has his immediate goal and his ultimate goal and for this he endures every kind of labour tirelessly even gratefully for this he grows not weary of fasting enjoys the fatigue of watching in the night is not tired by the continual reading of the scriptures and meditation upon them bears even the naked and grinding poverty and loneliness of life in this desert i have no doubt that this was the goal which has led you on to turn from your family and homeland and scorn the pleasures of this world and to travel so far to find us ordinary and ignorant men living squalidly in this desert tell me he said what is the purpose which has brought you to bear all this cheerfully 5 3 i tried not to answer but when he persisted i said that we bore all this for the sake of the kingdom of heaven 4 yes said moses that is indeed the ultimate goal but first you ought to know the immediate goal for which we strive in order to make the ultimate goal possible i said simply that i did not know i compared the aims of every art or science said moses and how each must have its immediate goal on which the mind may concentrate and unless it does concentrate with care and perseverance it cannot attain its ultimate goal the farmer's ultimate goal is to live well with fertile crops his immediate goal is to eradicate brambles and weeds from the soil and he knows that this is the only way to be sure of his ultimate end the trader has to amass goods for sale before he can amass riches it is vain to yearn for wealth without choosing the path which leads to it ambitious men have first to decide what profession they will follow so as to have some reasonable prospect of attaining the honours they desire in the same way the ultimate goal of our life is the kingdom of heaven but we have to ask what the immediate goal is for if we do not find it we shall exhaust ourselves in futile efforts the conferences of cassian iq7 travellers who miss their way are still tiring themselves though they are walking no nearer to their destination at this remark we stood and gaped the old man went on the ultimate goal of our way of life is as i said the kingdom of god or kingdom of heaven the immediate aim is purity of heart for without purity of heart none can enter into that kingdom we should fix our gaze on this target and walk to wards it in as straight a line as possible if our thoughts wander away from it even a little we should bring back our gaze to wards it and use it as a kind of test which at once brings all our efforts back onto the one path 5 when expert archers want to display their prowess before a king they try to shoot their arrows into little targets which have the prizes painted on them they know they can only win the prize which is their real goal by shooting straight into the mark which is their immediate goal but suppose that the target were carried out of sight they would then have no means of knowing how unskilfully and crookedly they were shooting but would be shooting their arrows at random into the air without any guide to accurate or inaccurate aim and without the pos sibility of estimating what correction was needed st paul tells us that the end which we have set before us is eternal life having your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life 1 the scopes is purity of heart which he rightly terms holiness without which eternal life cannot be won it is as though he said having your scopos in purity of heart and your telos eternal life and significantly he uses the very word scopes to describe it forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press forward toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god 2 in greek the words for press forward to the mark are kata scopon dioko and really mean press forward according to the mark it is as if he said with this aim whereby i forget what is behind the sins of the old man i strive to attain to the prize of heaven then whatever can guide us towards purity of heart is to be followed with all our power whatever draws us away from it is to be avoided as hurtful and worse it is for this end to keep our hearts continually pure that we do and endure everything that we spurn parents and home and position and wealth and comfort and every earthly pleasure if we do not keep this mark continually before the eyes all our travail will be futile waste rom 6 aa 2 phil 3 13 14 ig8 western asceticism that wins nothing and will stir up in us a chaos of ideas instead of singlemindedness unless the mind has some fixed point to which it can keep coming back and to which it tries to fasten itself it will flutter hither and thither according to the whim of the passing moment and follow whatever immediate and external impression is presented to it 6 this is the reason why some people who have given away worldly wealth in gold or silver or lands are afterwards agi tated about a knife a pencil a pin or a pen if they steadily contemplated purity of heart they would never suffer over these trivialities the state of mind which they sought to avoid by giving away their property some people guard their books so closely that they refuse to let anyone else touch them or read them for a moment and so they minister to themselves the irritation which is the death of the prayerful life in those very times which ought to give them an opportunity for patience and charity they have given up all their property for the love of christ and yet keep their old acquisitive attitude over little things and quickly become upset over them then they are as barren of fruit as those who as st paul said lack charity prophesying in the spirit he said though i give all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing 3 it is clear that you do not attain the perfect life simply by self denial or simply by throwing away your money or your rank there must go with it the charity which the apostle des cribed and which consists in purity of heart alone for not to be envious not to be puffed up not to be angry not to do wrong not to seek one's own not to rejoice in iniquity not to think evil and the rest what is this except the continual offering of a perfect and pure heart to god a heart which is kept free from every earthly distraction 7 to this end everything is to be done solitude watches in the night manual labour nakedness reading and the other disciplines we know that their purpose is to free the heart from injury by bodily passions and to keep it free they are to be the rungs of a ladder up which it may climb to perfect charity if by accident some right and needful occupation prevents us from keeping these acts of discipline we should not be guilty of gloom or annoyance for the aim of these acts is to drive away these faults the loss you incur by being irritated out weighs the gain of fasting dislike of your brother cannot be 3 1 cor 13 3 the conferences of cassian 199 counterbalanced by reading the bible these practices of fast ing watching withdrawal to the hermitage meditation on the scriptures are all subordinate means to your chief aim which is purity of heart or charity and we ought never to allow them to take precedence over charity charity will not suffer hurt if some necessary reason prevents us fulfilling our disciplinary rule none of these practices are of any profit at all if the pur pose for which they are undertaken is lost a man diligently collects all the tools of his trade he does not expect to sit in idleness and enjoy possession of the tools but to use them skilfully for the purpose for which they were designed in the same way fasting watching meditation on scripture nakedness and poverty are not perfection but the means towards it not the end of our discipline but the means to that end the man who is content with these practices as the summum bonum and not as means will use them in vain he pos sesses the tools of the trade but has no idea what they are for whatever can trouble our purity and peace of mind however useful and necessary it seems to be should be avoided as hurt ful this is the general rule by which we can avoid wandering off the right path and keep in a straight line towards our end 8 it should be our main effort the immovable and steadfast purpose of the heart to cleave with our mind to the things of god and to god himself whatever is not this however im portant should be put second or last and judged to be hurtful there is a lovely type of this mental attitude in the gospel story of martha and mary when martha was performing her act of holy ministry in serving the lord and his disciples mary was sitting at jesus feet which in faith she had kissed and anointed and was hanging upon his words as he taught the things of the spirit the lord praised mary above martha because she had chosen the better part and that which should not be taken away from her for when martha was working away in a truly religious spirit and was busy about much serving she saw that unaided she could not serve so many people and asked the lord that her sister might help her saying carest thou not that my sister has left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she help me she was calling mary to no lowly task but to an excellent work of ministry yet the lord replied martha martha thou art anxious and troubled about many things we need few things or even one thing mary has chosen the good part which shall not be taken away from her 4 4 luke 10 4o 2 a text with no mean manuscript authority to support it 20o western asceticism the lord you see placed the chief good in divine contem plation all the other virtues however necessary and useful and good we deem them must be placed on a lower plane because they are sought for the sake of this one thing when the lord said thou art anxious and troubled about many things but we need few things or even one thing he was putting the sup reme good not in the pursuit of virtue however excellent and fruitful but in the pure and simple and singleminded contem plation of himself when he said that few things were needful he means that contemplation which begins with meditation upon a few holy subjects from the contemplation of these few sub jects the soul in its progress mounts with god's help to one thing the gazing upon god the soul passes beyond saintly acts and ministries and attains the true knowledge of god and feeds upon his beauty mary therefore has chosen the good part which shall not be taken away from her mark the text when he says c mary has chosen the good part he is silent about martha and seems in no way to blame her yet in praising mary he declares the work of martha to be lower again when he says which shall not be taken away from her he shows that martha's part could be taken away from her to minister to the body is a transitory work to listen to his word is the work of eternity 9 germanus and i were deeply disturbed at these words what 3 i said shall fasts and reading and works of mercy of righteousness and of kindness be taken away from us surely the lord promises to these works the reward of the king dom of heaven when he says come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world for i was an hungered and ye gave me to eat i was thirsty and ye gave me to drink 5 and the rest how shall we lose these things which open to the doers of them the gates of the kingdom of heaven 10 i did not say answered moses that the reward for good deeds should be taken away the lord said c whosoever shall give to one of the least of these a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you he shall not lose his reward 6 i say that the deed itself which has to be done because of the needs or temptations of the body or the injustice of the world will be taken away the earnest practice of reading or of fasting is only useful to purify the heart and chastise the flesh so long as the flesh lusteth against the spirit 7 sometimes 5 matt 25 34 5 matt 10 42 gal 5 17 the conferences of cassian 2oi we see that even in this life these works are taken away 3 men exhausted with austerities or old age are no longer able to perform them all the more shall they cease in that future life when c this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and the body which is now a natural body shall have risen a spiritual body 8 and the flesh has begun to be transformed so that it no longer lusts against the spirit st paul is plainly referring to this when he says bodily exercise is profitable for a little but godliness by which he surely means charity is profitable for all things having the promise of the life which now is and of the life to come 9 what is said to be profitable for a little cannot be profitable for ever and cannot of itself bring a man to the perfect life the phrase tor a little might mean one of two things it might mean c for a short time since these bodily exercises are not going to last as long as the man who practises them or it might mean only of little profit corporal austerity brings the first beginnings of progress but it does not beget that perfect charity which has the promise of this life and the life to come we deem these works necessary because without them we cannot climb to charity for what you call works of godliness and mercy are necessary for this life where inequality prevails among men but we should not expect to do them unless we found the world full of the needy and destitute and infirm thanks to the wickedness of greedy men who have seized and kept for their use though they do not use them the goods which god created for all in common so long as injustice prevails in the world works of mercy are needed and will be useful to the man who practises them and his godliness and good intention will make him an heir of eternal fife but in the world to come when all men are equal these works will not be needed there everyone will pass from the multiplicity of different good works to the love of god and the contemplation of the things of god in an unceasing purity of heart this is the goal which the hermits direct all their efforts to win even in this world this is why they study to win the true knowledge of god and to purify their minds though still in this corruptible flesh they seek that state which they will find when they lay aside their corruption and attain to the promise of our lord and saviour blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god 10 8 i cor 15 53 and 44 i tim 4 8 1 matt 5 8 2o2 western asceticism 11 it is no wonder that these works shall pass away when st paul asserts that even the loftier gifts of the spirit will pass away and declares that charity alone will abide for ever 6 whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away 5 but charity never faileth 11 every other gift is granted for our temporal needs and use and in the future king dom will disappear charity will continue uninterrupted for charity is not only useful to us in this life it will abide yet more excellently when we have put aside the burden of this flesh and cleave in spotless purity to god 12 germanus is there any frail mortal who can be im movable in contemplation and never think about a guest arriving or visiting the sick or manual labour or the need to show kindness to pilgrims and travellers must he not be interrupted by the need to eat we should like to know how the mind is capable of clinging to god whom men can neither see nor understand 13 moses you are right a frail mortal cannot contem plate god in such a way that his mind is never drawn aside what is important is knowing where we ought to concentrate our mental attention and how to direct the eyes of the soul when the mind succeeds in this it can be glad when it fails and it fails as often as the mental attention is withdrawn from god it can be sorry and feel that this is a fall from the supreme good and think that even a passing lapse in contemplating christ is a sin like adultery whenever the gaze strays even a little we should turn back the eyes of the heart into the straight line towards him every thing depends upon the soul's detachment if the devil has been driven out and sin no longer reigns then the kingdom of god is founded in us as it is written in the gospel the kingdom of god cometh not with observation nor shall they say lo here or lo there verily i say unto you that the kingdom of god is within you 12 the only thing which can be c within us is know ledge of the truth or ignorance of it and affection for righteous ness or affection for sin whereby we prepare our hearts to be a kingdom either of christ or the devil st paul described the nature of this kingdom thus tor the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit 3 13 if the kingdom of god is within us and the king dom of god is righteousness and peace and joy then the man 11 i gor 13 8 smd 10 12 luke 17 20 1 13 rom 14 17 the conferences of gassian 2o3 who abides in these is surely within the kingdom of god and the man who abides in unrighteousness and conflict and the melancholy that kills the life of the spirit is already a citizen of the devil's kingdom of hell and of death these are the signs whether it is god's kingdom or the devil's if we lift up pur mind's eye to the condition of heavenly and supernatural virtues which are truly in the kingdom of god how shall we imagine it to be anything but a state of continual joy what is so natural in true blessedness as unshakable peace of mind and happiness this is not a mere guess you have the sure authority of the lord when he disclosed the nature of that heavenly kingdom behold i make a new heaven and a new earth and the former things shall not be remembered nor come into the heart but ye shall be glad and rejoice for ever in my creation and again e joy and gladness shall be found therein thanksgiving and the voice of praise and there shall be month after month and sabbath after sabbath and again they shall have joy and gladness sorrow and sighing shall flee away and still more clearly listen to what the lord himself says of jeru salem c i will make thine officers peace and thine overseers righteousness violence shall no more be heard in thy land nor desolation nor destruction within thy borders salvation shall possess thy walls and praise shall possess thy gates the sun shall be no more thy light by day neither shall the brightness of the moon give light to thee but the lord shall be thine ever lasting light and thy god thy glory thy sun shall no more go down neither shall thy moon withdraw itself but the lord shall be thine everlasting light and the days of thy mourning shall be ended 14 st paul does not say simply and without qualification that all joy is the kingdom of god but selectively and specially joy in the holy spirit he knew that there was another kind of joy a joy to be detested the scripture refers to this kind of joy in texts like the world shall rejoice or woe unto you that laugh for you shall mourn the kingdom of heaven then may be understood in three ways first the heavens shall reign which means the rule of the saints as in texts like be thou over five cities and thou over ten or the word to the disciples c ye shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel second that christ begins to reign over the heavens when all creation is subject to god ulsa 65 17 18 51 3 66 23 35 i o 60 17 20 2o4 western asceticism and he becomes all in all or third that the saints shall reign in heaven with the lord 15 14 everyone knows that on earth he shares the ministry which the lord shared during his earthly life and he doubts not that in the life to come he will be a companion of the lord whose servant and friend he has in this life chosen to be the lord himself said c lf anyone serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall my servant also be 9 16 a man gains the kingdom of the devil by consenting to sin the kingdom of god by practising goodness in purity of heart and in knowledge of the things of the spirit wherever the king dom of god is is life eternal wherever the kingdom of the devil is is death and hell if a man is in death and hell he cannot praise the lord the prophet spake thus the dead shall not praise thee o lord nor shall those who go down into hell he means the hell of sin but we are alive 5 he means alive not to sin nor this world but to god and shall bless the lord from this time forth for ever more for in death no man remembereth god and who shall confess the lord in hell 17 again he means the hell of sin no one not even though he call himself a christian or a monk a thousand times over confesses god while he is sinning no one remembers god while he allows what the lord hates it is like pretending he is a faithful servant while he takes no notice of his master's commands st paul says of a widow she that giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth 18 and this is the kind of death he means many men whose bodies are alive are dead and in hell and cannot praise god and many whose bodies are dead bless and praise god together in the spirit o ye spirits and souls of the righteous bless ye the lord and let every spirit praise the lord 5 19 in the apocalypse the souls of the martyrs are described as praying to god as well as praising him in the gospel the lord said plainly to the sadducees have you not read the word which god had spoken to you i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is the god not of the dead but of the living all men live to him and st paul says god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a city after they have parted from their body they can still act and feel as is evident from the is john 16 20 luke 6 25 luke 19 17 and 19 matt 19 28 isjohn 12 26 i ps 115 17 18 6 5 is i tim 5 6 i dan 3 86 lxx ps 150 6 the conferences of cassian 205 parable of dives and lazarus where the poor man went to abraham's bosom the place of bliss and the other was con sumed with the agonizing heat of everlasting fire remember what he said to the thief on the cross today shalt thou be with me in paradise 9 20 surely this means not only that the original understandings remain in souls but also that they enjoy a state proportionate to the goodness or other wise of their deeds the lord would never have promised him this if he had known that his soul would after its separation from the body lose all power of perception or be annihilated it was not his flesh but his soul which was to enter paradise with christ the heretics have suggested an ungodly punctuation of the sentence which we should at all costs disallow and detest because they do not believe that christ could be in paradise on the same day on which he descended into hell they put the comma after the word today and read verily i say unto thee today thou shalt be with me in paradise 3 the aim of this punctuation is to suggest that the promise was not fulfilled at once but that it will be fulfilled in the general resurrection these heretics have appealed to a text which they have mis understood the word which he spoke to the jews who believed that he was tied and bound like themselves in the coils of human frailty no one hath ascended into heaven but he who came down from heaven even the son of man who is in heaven 21 by this text to the penitent thief he shows that the souls of the dead do not lose their senses or their affections like hope and melancholy joy and fear and that they begin to experience a foretaste of what they will receive in the last judgement that they are not annihilated as some infidels think but they enjoy a fuller life and praise god more ardently put aside scriptural evidence for a moment and consider the matter a little by the light admittedly dim of human reason must not the mind be worse than silly nay worse than de ranged which can even think it possible for the most precious part of human nature that part which st paul tells us is formed in the image of god to lose consciousness in the moment when it puts aside the burden of mortal flesh this is the part of the human being which contains the whole power of the reasoning faculty the part which enables the dumb and un perceptive material flesh to perceive and perceive reasonably it follows logically that when the mind has put off the flesh which blunts its faculties it will recreate into fresh strength the 20 matt 22 131 2 heb 1 1 16 luke 23 143 21 john 3 13 2o6 western asceticism intellectual faculties and so far from losing them will find them purer and more acute st paul was so vividly aware of this truth that he wished to depart from the flesh and thereby come into closer unity with his lord i have a desire to be dissolved and to be with christ which is far better for while we are in the body we are absent from the lord and therefore c we are bold and have our desire always to be absent from the body and present with the lord wherefore also we strive whether absent or present to be pleasing to him he believed with an absolute and confident faith that being in the body meant absence from christ and de parture from the body brought presence with christ he spoke again still more openly about this fuller life of souls in the text but ye are come to mount sion and the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels and the church of the first born who are written in heaven and the spirits of just men made perfect and again we have had our earthly fathers and masters and we revered them shall we not much more be subject to the father of spirits and live 22 15 in many ways we come to contemplate god we know him in worshipping his very being which we cannot fathom the vision which is yet hidden though it is promised and for which we may hope we know him in the majesty of his crea tion in regarding his justice in apprehending the help we re ceive for our daily lives we contemplate him when we see what he has wrought with his saints in every generation when we feel awe at the mighty power which rules creation the un measurable knowledge of his eye which sees into the secrets of every heart when we remember that he has counted the grains of sand upon the shore and the waves upon the sea and the raindrops that he sees every day and hour through all the centuries past and future when we remember his mercy un imaginable seeing countless sins committed every moment and yet bearing them with inexhaustible long suffering when we contemplate that he has called us by reason of no merit which he found in us but simply of his free grace when we see so many opportunities of salvation offered to those whom he is going to adopt as his sons how he caused us to be born in cir cumstances where we might from our cradles receive his grace and the knowledge of his law how he is working to overcome the enemy in us simply for the pleasure of his goodness and is 22 phil 1 123 ii cor 5 6 heb 12 s 2 3 and 9 the conferences of cassian rewarding us with everlasting blessedness and finally how for our salvation he was incarnate and made man and has spread his wonderful mysteries among all nations there are countless other contemplations of this kind which arise in our perceptions in proportion to our holiness of life and our purity of heart and through which if our eyes are clean we see and grasp god no man in whom anything of earthly passion remains can keep the vision continually thou canst not see my face said the lord tor no man shall see me and live 23 live to this world and its desires 1 6 germanus how is it that idle thoughts creep into our minds when we do not want them or are unaware of them so that it is quite difficult even to understand them let alone drive them away is it possible for a mind to avoid delusions like this 17 moses thoughts inevitably besiege the mind but any earnest person has the power to accept or reject them their origin is in some ways outside ourselves but whether to choose them or not lies within us 24 but because i said it was impossible for thoughts not to come to the mind you must not put all the blame upon the spirits who assault our integrity otherwise the will of man would not be free and we could make no effort for our own improvement to a great extent we have the capacity to better the sort of thoughts we receive to let holy thoughts or secular thoughts grow into our minds this is the purpose of reading the bible often and meditating upon it always to attain a higher state of recollectedness this is the purpose of singing psalms often so that feelings of repentance may be continually elicited this is the purpose of constancy in watchings or fasts or prayer so that the mind in its weakened body may care nothing for the world but may contemplate the things of heaven if we neglect these the mind will surely creep back towards squalid sin and fall 1 8 this movement of the heart may suitably be compared to a mill wheel spinning round under power from a waterfall the wheel must revolve so long as the water flows but the mill owner can decide whether to grind wheat or barley or darnel and the wheel will crush whatever he chooses so the mind cannot but move hither and thither under the impetus of external circumstances and the thoughts which pour 23 ex 33 20 24 reprobatio vel electio lies in our power possibly a sentence glancing at st augustine's theology of grace 208 western asceticism in upon it like a torrent but which thoughts to reject or accept an earnest and careful mind will determine if we are continu ally meditating upon holy scripture and lifting up the mind to desire a perfect fife and to hope for a future blessedness the mind cannot help receiving and dwelling upon the thoughts of the spiritual which thereby arise if sloth and carelessness dominate us and we spend our time in sinful and idle gossip or are busied unnecessarily with the cares of the world a variety of tares will infallibly spring up and minister temptations harm ful to the heart as our lord and saviour said where our treasure is of effort and intention there will our heart abide 25 19 it is important to distinguish three sources of our thoughts god the devil ourselves thoughts are of god when he illuminates our minds with his holy spirit helping us upon our road or when for our salvation he chastens us and casts us into a mood of repentance that we have failed and been idle or when he opens to us the mysteries of heaven and turns us to choose decisively to amend our lives 26 thoughts are of the devil when he tries to make us fall by holding before us the pleasure of sin by making bad appear good or transforming himself into an angel of light 27 thoughts are of ourselves when as normally we remember what we are doing or have done or have been told 28 25 gf matt 6 21 2 examples from the bible when kong ahasuerus was chastened by the lord he was stirred to ask for the books of the annals and so remembered the services of mordecai rewarded him with the highest rank and re voked his bloody order to kill the jews the prophet says i will hearken what the lord god shall speak within me ps 85 8 another prophet says an angel uttered speaking within me zech i 14 the son of god promised that he will come with his father and dwell among us cf john 14 23 it is not you that speak but the spirit of your father who speaks within you 9 matt 10 20 and st paul you seek a proof of christ who speaks in me ii cor 13 3 27 the evangelist notices it and after supper was ended when the devil had already put it into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray the lord and after the sop satan entered with him 1 john 13 2 and 27 peter said to ananias satan has tempted thee in thy heart to lie to the holy spirit 9 acts 5 3 compare what we read much earlier in the gospel in eccl 10 4 if the spirit ascend upon thee with power leave not thy place this description of ecclesiastes as in evangelio caused much perturbation to the copyists in the third book of kings it is said to god against ahab in the character of an unclean spirit i will go forth and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets i kings 22 22 28 examples david said i thought upon the ancient days and had in the conferences of cassian 2og 20 we ought always to remember that thoughts may arise in these three different ways and try to determine discreetly the source and the author of the thoughts we find this judge ment upon their author enables us to consider how we ought to behave towards them and so become what the lord com manded us to be good money changers 3 29 the highest skill of a money changer consists partly in testing when the gold coin is unadulterated and as they commonly say e of true alloy and when it is not sufficiently purified by the fire and partly in not being deceived by a cheap brass penny if it is fabricated to glitter like gold they have to recognize coins stamped with the heads of usurpers and in spite of the greater difficulty to determine which coins bear the head of the legal emperor and yet have been illegally minted and finally they have to use scales to discover whether the legal coins have lost anything of their proper weight the gospel text by using this simile tells us what we ought to do in the life of the spirit first whatever doctrine enters the heart we have to examine it to see whether it is of god and purified in the holy spirit's fire or whether it belongs to the false religion of the jews or arises from the intellectual pride of a secular philosophy and is making a mere outward show of piety we must fulfil the pre cept of the apostle believe not every spirit but prove the spirits whether they are of god 30 this first test is failed by men who become monks and then are drawn by the grace of style or by philosophical teachings which have an apparent meaning consonant with religion and attractive to religious men like cheap brass coins manufactured to resemble gold and so impoverishing their cheated owners for ever they entice them away again to the world's clangour or to the bombast of heretical thought we read in the book ofjoshua that this happened to achor who coveted and stole a golden weight from the camp of the philistines and was smitten with a curse and condemned to suffer an eternal death mind the years of old and i meditated by night i exercised myself with my heart and searched out my spirit ps 77 6 7 lxx again the lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are but vain ps 94 1 1 and the thoughts of the righteous are judgements prov 12 15 in the gospel the lord said to the pharisees why do you think evil in your hearts matt 9 4 29 a saying found nowhere in the gospels but commonly reported among the early fathers 30 i john 4 i 2io western asceticism secondly we should take care that no faulty interpretation mixed with the pure gold of scripture should delude us about the value of the money wily satan tried to impose thus upon our lord and saviour hke any ordinary man with an evil motive he interpreted a text about the guardian angels which applies generally to all men as though it possessed a special application to him who needed no guardian angels tor he shall give his angels charge concerning thee to keep thee in all thy ways and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone 3 31 by some skilful as sumption he twists and turns the precious text of scripture into a meaning harmful and contrary to the true meaning like a coin which seems to be gold but is stamped with the usurper's head sometimes he tries to cheat us with counterfeits by sug gesting that we ought to undertake some good work a work which apparently leads towards virtue but which would not be approved by our elders and in fact leads to sin sometimes he suggests excessive or impossible fasts too long vigils too many prayers unsuitable reading and so brings us to a bad end sometimes he persuades us to go visiting for good and religious purposes and so extracts us from our spirit filled cloisters and our quiet and friendly retirement or he persuades us to under take the charge of nuns or of pauper women and so entangles us in the anxieties which destroy a spiritual life sometimes on a plea of building the faith of many and winning souls for religion he incites us to want to be ordained and so snatches us from the humility and the discipline of our way of life all these courses of action deceive the unwary by appearing to be merciful and pious they are contrary to our salvation and our profession they are like coins which imitate the coins of the true emperor but have not been coined by the legal mint though at first they seem full of piety they have not been coined by approved and catholic fathers but have been manu factured in secret and bring loss to the ignoramuses who accept them unawares however useful and needful they seem to be at the moment later they begin to undermine the solidity of our religious profession and to weaken so to say the whole body of our purpose then it is best that they be amputated like a right hand or foot which we need yet which causes us to stumble better it is to leave behind one limb if by so doing we may keep the other parts of the body healthy and active and so be able to limp into the kingdom of heaven than to try to take 31 matt 4 6 the conferences of cassian 211 the whole body with us and stumble on the way to be parted from our strict rule may lead to a loss which can never be com pensated by future results and which would cause all the best fruits of our labour to be destroyed in hell fire 32 21 not long ago we heard that abba john who lives at lycopolis was deluded in this way he had put off taking food for two days and had exhausted his body and when at last he sat down to eat the devil came to him in the shape of a hideous negro and fell at his feet saying forgive me for making you undertake this labour john who possessed a perfect judgement understood that on the pretext of an abstinence unsuitably practised the devil had cheated him and forced him into a useless fatigue of body and worse a fatigue which would harm the spirit here he was cheated by a forged coin he respected the face of the true emperor imprinted upon it but failed to examine carefully enough whether it was legally struck the final duty of a good money changer is to check the weight whenever we find a particular course of action sug gested we weigh it with a judgement as careful and as balanced as possible to determine whether it is a course of common honesty whether it can be done soberly and in the fear of god whether it is the course of integrity or whether it is short weight like a dud coin a trivial piece of ostentation or conceit or love of novelty we weigh it in the public scales that is test it by the acts and teachings of the apostles and prophets and then either keep it as true and genuine and authorized by those authorities or else carefully throw it away as debased and of an inadequate and unauthorized weight 22 we need then the power of discrimination for four pur poses first to know whether the metal is genuine or painted secondly to reject as forgeries because bearing the illegally stamped head of the legal emperor ideas which falsely suggest works of piety thirdly to detect the coins which are stamped with the usurper's head the perversion of the precious gold of scripture by untrue and heretical interpretations 32 proverbs expresses this sort of illusion powerfully there are ways which seem to be right to a man but their latter end will come into the depths of hell and an evil man is harmful when he attaches himself to a good man which means that the devil deceives when he puts on a cloak of sanctity but he hates the sound of the watchman which means the power of discretion which comes from the advice of the elders prov i6 25 3 lxx ii:i 212 western asceticism fourthly to reject the coins which are light weight corroded by vanity coins which cannot pass the test when weighed in the scales of the fathers without this discrimination we might lose the reward of all our labour by disobeying the command which our lord warned us to do all we could to observe lay not up for yourselves treasure on the earth where rust and moth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal 33 to do anything with the aim of increasing our reputation is to lay up treasure on earth to hide it and bury it where demons will eat it vanity will corrode it like rust pride will ruin it like moths and the man who hid it will gain nothing from it we should ever examine the inner sanctuary of the heart and track down whatever comes into it perhaps a snake or lion has crept into the mental fastness through the undergrowth and has left a spoor which other beasts could follow if we were heedless it is as though we were always to be ploughing up the ground of the heart the plough is the constant recollection of the lord's cross and by its means we shall exterminate the rats and vipers which have made their habitations in our field 23 seeing our surprise and earnestness at his words he stopped his discourse out of respect and was silent for a little then he added your eagerness has provoked me to talk at length my sons it struck a spark which kindled me into flame i see that you thirst for the teaching which leads to a perfect life i still want to say a little more about the virtue of a bal anced judgement discretion a grace which guards the keep in the castle of all virtues and to give you practical examples of its value and the opinions of the old fathers about it i remember how often people have importuned me even to tears to talk on this subject and how although i longed to satisfy them i could not i felt nothing had nothing to say and could not even send them away with a little word of comfort this is a clear sign that the lord gives a man grace of speech in pro portion to the sincerity with which his audience wishes to hear him only a little of the night remains not enough to finish the subject let us therefore go to rest if we do not take a little rest now we shall later have to sleep all night long let us keep the remainder of our talk for another day or night the best counsellors on the subject of discretion ought to start by displaying the virtue in their own conduct and not fall into its 33 matt 6 19 the conferences of cassian 213 opposite by talking too long and so contradicting what they preach by their practice though i still mean to talk about the virtue of discretion so far as the lord gives me power it will be a fundamental advantage if i am not so busy praising the excellence of moderation that i go on talking immoderately so moses put an end to the conference though we were still greedy for more he encouraged us to sleep for a short time suggesting that we should lie down on the mats on which we were sitting and use our bundles for pillows these bundles are made of thick papyrus leaves evenly tied together into long slender bales six feet in length sometimes the brothers use them at the daily service instead of a low stool sometimes as pillows for they are quite soft and comfortable they are thought particularly suitable for use by the monks because though they are reasonably soft they are cheap and easy to make papyrus grows everywhere on the banks of the nile and the material is flexible and easily utilized we obeyed the old man's command to go to sleep though we thought it tiresome for we were still excited and delighted by his conference and were looking forward to continue the talk the next morning moses resumed his talk he described discretion as the greatest gift of god's grace st antony had taught that it was the mistress of virtues because without it the virtues could end in ruin discretion teaches the monk to avoid excess on either hand and ever to walk the king's highway herein lies the wisdom without which the inward house cannot be built discretion is the mother of virtues as well as their guardian and regulator moses gave examples of destruction through lack of dis cretion too rigorous solitude too rigorous abstinence too much faith in visions germanus asked how to gain discretion and so become good money changers moses replied that true discretion is gained by true humility and the first proof of humility is to reserve everything even the thoughts to the judgement of the elders a wrong thought is enfeebled the moment it is confessed there is nothing so liable to cause a fall as leaving the advice of the elders and experi menting with untried methods 1214 western asceticism discretion is to be found not in all old men but in those old men known to have lived a religious life when young practically moses insisted upon i the importance of dis closing thoughts to the elders and receiving discretion from them and 2 the need for moderation in fasting and vigils excessive abstinence being as weakening to the soul as no abstinence conference 9 the first conference of abba isaac on prayer 1 if the lord gives his blessing these conferences of abba isaac will keep the promise to write about unceasing prayer which i made in the second book of the institutes when i have completed these i believe i shall have fulfilled the duty which bishop castor of blessed memory laid upon me as well as your request bishop leontius and brother helladius first you will forgive the length of the book i tried to compress and to omit much but still it is longer than i planned that is why i leave out much of blessed isaac's talk about various monastic teach ings and proceed to the latter part of his discourse 2 isaac fe every monjk who looks for the perfect way aims at uninterrupted prayerfulness as far as is possible to a frail man he struggles for imperturbable peace and purity of mind this is the reason why we try so unwearyingly to practise the different disciplines of the body and the spirit the discipline of the body and spirit on the one side and unceasing prayer fulness on the other cannot help having a mutual effect upon each other the keystone in the arch of all virtues is perfect prayer and without this keystone the archway becomes rickety and insecure conversely without the virtues no one can attain the continual serenity of prayerfulness which i am discussing therefore i cannot rightly and shortly treat of the effect and chief object of prayer which is perfected in the truly virtuous life unless first i treat systematically the way of avoiding sin and attaining goodness as the gospel parable teaches the man who is going to build a tower first takes care to estimate and assemble his materials but it is impossible to build a fine tower upon this prepared material unless the ground is cleared of rotten or dead rubbish and the foundations are built in firm or lively as they say soil or on rock so it is in the realm of the spirit to build a tower of the spirit you must clear the soul of its sins and passions and build firm foundations of simplicity the conferences of cassian 215 and humility upon the gospel this is the only way the tower can rise unshakable as high as heaven then though the tempests of passion be poured down upon it though the floods of persecution beat upon it like battering rams though the storm of hostile spirits blows upon it it shall still stand and stand undamaged 3 no one can offer prayer of a proper intensity and sincerity unless he is seeking to live thus first there must be no anxiety about the bodily needs not only no worry about a piece of busi ness but not even the recollection of it no detraction no gossip above all no anger nor wrongful sorrow for these cannot but disturb the spirit no lust of the flesh no love of money by clearing the ground weeding out these and other public sins a man makes his life pure and attains the state of sim plicity and innocence then he must lay a foundation deep enough to support a tower that will reach to heaven and the only foundation deep and strong enough is humility the lower storeys of the building are the other virtues the soul should be kept from wandering abroad and then little by little will begin to lift its eyes to contemplate god whatever the mind has been thinking about before it prays will certainly come to it while it is praying therefore before we begin to pray we ought to be trying to be the kind of people whom we wish god to find when we pray the mind is condi tioned by its recent state in prayer the mind remembers recent acts or thoughts or experiences sees them dancing before it like ghosts and this annoys us or depresses us or reminds us of past lust or past worry or makes us i am ashamed to say laugh like fools at some absurd joke or circumstance or go over again some recent conversation whatever we do not want to creep into our time of prayer we must try to keep out of the heart when we are not praying st paul's words were tray without ceasing 3 and c ln every place lifting up pure hands without wrath or controversy 34 to obey this is impossible unless the mind is purified from sin is given to virtue as its natural good and is continually nourished by the contemplation of god 4 there is a good comparison between the soul and a deli cate little feather if a feather has not been touched by damp it is so light that the slightest breath of wind can puff it high into the air but if even a little damp has weighed it down it cannot float and falls straight to the ground in the same way the 34 i thess 5 17 tim a 8 2l6 western asceticism mind 3 if not burdened by sin and the cares of daily life and evil passion has a natural purity which lifts it from earth to heaven at the least breath of a meditation upon the invisible things of the spirit the lord's command is sufficient warning take heed that your hearts be not weighed down by surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this world 35 so if we want our prayers to reach the sky and beyond the sky we must make sure that the mind is so unburdened by the weights of sin and pas sion as to be restored to its natural buoyancy then the prayer will rise to god 5 yet we should notice the weights of the mind which the lord selected he did not mention adultery fornication murder blasphemy theft which everyone knows to be damn able sins he mentioned surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this world 5 faults which worldly men do not take trouble to avoid nor consider damnable and which shameful though it is some people who call themselves monks think harmless or profitable though these three sins literally committed weigh down the soul to the earthy and separate it from god they are easily avoidable especially by people like ourselves who are a long way from ordinary life and have absolutely no opportunity to engage in literal overeating or drunkenness or worldly business but even though we have given away all our property even though we have not feasted have not drunk wine even though we have been living in a hermit's cell there is another kind of over eating and drinking and anxiety about the world a spiritual kind which is just as dangerous is harder to avoid and which frequently traps us 36 the heart soiled with sin and passion will be a heart weighted by this drunkenness of the spirit and anxi eties can still afflict us even though we are not engaged in worldly business that is proved by the elders rule that any food which is more than unavoidable necessary and ordinary diet must be regarded as worldly anxiety for example suppose that a job with a wage of a shilling 35 luke 21 34 36 cf the prophet joel 1 15 lxx awake ye that are drunk but not with wine and another be astonished and wonder and stagger be drunk and not with wine be moved and not with drunkenness isa 29 g so the wine of this drunkenness must be what the prophet calls the fury of dragons see the roots from which this vine is growing from the vineyard of sodom is their vine and their branches of gomorrah for the fruit and seed of the text their grape is a grape of gall theirs is a cluster of bitterness deut 32 and 32 lxx the conferences of cassian 2iy would satisfy our needs and we try to work longer hours for two or three shillings or suppose that two tunics are sufficient one for the night and one for the day yet we become owners of three or four or suppose a hut of one or two rooms would be adequate yet we build four or five rooms and these larger and better decorated than we need then we are moved by secular pleasure and desire and are letting worldly passion reign so far as is possible for people in our situation 6 we have practical proof that this happens by the prompt ing of devils one day an elder of repute was passing by the cell of a brother who was suffering from this disease of the soul and used to sweat to build and repair buildings which he did not need from a distance the elder watched him breaking up a rock with a heavy hammer and he saw a negro standing beside him putting his hands on the hammer and inciting him to work harder for a long time the elder stood there marvel ling at the terrible appearances of the demon astonished that the monk could thus be deceived for when the monk was exceeding weary and wanted to stop work and rest he was in cited by the demon to pick up his hammer again and go on and he was so buoyed up that he did not feel the harm which this overwork was doing him in the end the elder disturbed by this horrible satanic jest turned aside to the monk's cell greeted him and asked what are you doing my brother he replied we are working at this exceedingly hard rock which we can hardly break at all the elder said you are right in saying we can't you were not alone when you hit it but an un seen person was standing by you driving you on to hit harder in this way it is no proof that our hearts are not plagued with ambition if we abstain from worldly occupations in which we could not engage even if we wanted nor if we despise what would if we achieved them render us notorious among worldly men as well as religious men but only if we eschew everything which ministers to our own power even when it seems to be clothed in a garment of right truly these things which seem trivial or which we see other monks allow without a qualm weigh the mind down more in proportion than the bigger things which normally and in their measure intoxicate the senses of worldly men for they prevent the monk from leaving the earthly mind behind and concen trating his due attention upon god and even a little parting from that supreme good must be regarded as an approach to destruction 2l8 western asceticism when the mind is freed from lust established in tranquillity and does not waver in its intention towards the one supreme good the monk will fulfil the precept of st paul pray without ceasing and c ln every place lifting up holy hands without wrath and controversy 37 by purity of heart so to say the mind is abstracted from earthly feelings and is re formed in the likeness of an angelic spirit then whatever thought the mind receives whatever it considers whatever it does will be a prayer of true purity and sincerity 7 germanus i would i could keep the thoughts of the things of the spirit as easily as i can conceive their first begin nings i conceive them in my heart through remembering the scripture or through recollecting spiritual acts or through an intuition of the heavenly mysteries and then they vanish all too soon though how i do not know and when the mind has found some other opportunity of spiritual experience other thoughts crowd in upon us and scatter the thoughts we had grasped the mind has no perseverance no stable control of its thoughts even when it does seem to retain them for a while i believe it happens unintentionally and if the retention of a thought is not in my power why should i think the origin of that thought to be so but this is a digression we ought to keep to the plan of your discourse in order not to delay any further your exposition of the nature of prayer leaving this question to its proper place i ask you to tell us at once the nature of prayer particularly in the light of st paups command to pray without ceasing by nature of prayer i would like first to know what sort of prayer it is that ought always to be offered and secondly how we can offer this prayer whatever it is your explanation confirms our ordinary experience that this cannot be done by any light pur pose of heart for you have defined the goal of the monks the summit of his moral ascent to consist in perfect prayer 8 isaac i imagine that no variety of prayer can be appre hended fully without great purity of heart and soul and the illumination of the holy spirit there are as many kinds of prayer as there are different states of soul as many kinds of prayer as there are souls although i know that my dull heart prevents me from experiencing all kinds of prayer yet so far as my slender experience allows i shall try to go through them in order according to the progress of the mind in purity the state in 37lthess 5 17 i tim 2 8 the conferences of cassian 2iq which its response to circumstance and its own effort have placed it its prayers will vary from moment to moment it is therefore certain that no one can go on sending up a prayer which never changes a man prays in one way when he is lively in another when he is weighed down with melancholy or des pair another when he is heartened by success another when he seeks absolution another when he asks for increase of grace or a special virtue or the removal of a special sin another when he is stricken with fear at the prospect of hell and the judgement to come another when he is longing for the future good another in need and danger another in peace and serenity another when he is enlightened by some revelation of heavenly mys teries another when he is oppressed by sensations of dryness and barrenness 9 i have spoken on the states of prayer not as much as the subject needs but as much as the time and my scant abilities warrant now i am faced with a greater difficulty to expound the four kinds of prayer which st paul mentioned i exhort therefore first of all that supplications prayers intercessions thanksgivings be made 38 we cannot suppose that st paul made this fourfold distinction without good reason first we must investigate what he meant by the different words he used supplication prayer intercession thanksgiving then we must ask are they to be used simultaneously do they enter into every prayer which is offered or are they to be offered in turn if in turn are they to be offered by the same man at different times or should one man offer supplications another prayers another intercessions another thanksgivings in accord ance with his state of life and spiritual progress 10 first then i must consider the meaning of the words and the difference between them secondly whether they are to be offered separately or simultaneously thirdly whether st paul arranged this order with a view to teaching the hearer something further or whether he put them in this order without a particular reason this last suggestion seems to me obviously absurd i cannot believe that the holy spirit uttered anything through the apostle without meaning something by it so i begin in the order i have said and trust in the lord's help 1 1 c i exhort therefore first of all that supplications be made supplication is a beseeching or petition for sins in it a person repentant for his present or past sins asks for pardon 38 1 tim a i 22o western asceticism 12 prayers arc those by which we offer a vow to god in greek it is called euche which is the synonym of vow 9 we pray in this way when we renounce the world and vow to mortify every act and earthly relation and to serve god with the whole heart we pray when we promise to despise secular honours and wealth and follow the lord with contrite heart and poverty of spirit we pray when we promise to be chaste in body and to suffer unwearyingly or when we vow to tear from the heart the roots of anger or the sorrow that brings spiritual death if we are guilty of sloth if we fall again to our old sins we shall be before the judgement seat about our prayers and vows and it will be said of us c lt is better not to vow than to vow and not to pay or as it is in greek it is better for thee not to pray than to pray and not to pay 13 the third kind intercession is customarily offered in moments of fervour for other men and women our family the peace of the world to use st paul's words we pray tor all men for kings and all in authority 40 14 the fourth kind thanksgiving is when the mind recol lects what god has done or is doing or looks forward to the good which he has prepared for them that love him and so offers its gratitude in an indescribable transport of spirit sometimes it offers still deeper prayers of this sort when the soul contem plates in singleness of heart the reward of the saints and so is moved in its happiness to pour forth a wordless thanksgiving 15 from each of these four kinds rise other opportunities of richer prayer whether the prayer is expressing repentance or is pledging the heart in the confident trust of a pure conscience or is expressing the intercessions which spring from a charitable heart or is rendering thanks in the sight of the great and loving gifts of god we have known prayers dart up like sparks from a fire it is therefore clear that all men need to use all four kinds the same person according to his diversity of affective states will use prayers of repentance or offering or intercession or thanksgiving nevertheless the first kind seems particularly suitable to beginners who are still smarting under the recollection of their sins the second kind seems particularly suitable to people who 39 where we read in greek tas euchas mou toi kynoi apodoso in latin we read i will pay my vows unto the lord gf the text of eccl 5 3 4 if thou vowest a vow unto the lord do not delay to pay it which is written in greek if thou prayest a prayer unto the lord do not delay to pay 40 i tim 2 1 2 the conferences of cassian 221 have already attained a certain progress towards goodness intercession seems particularly suitable to people who are ful filling the pledges of self offering which they made see the frailty of others and are moved by charity to intercede for them thanksgiving seems particularly suitable for those who have torn out of their hearts the sins which pricked their con science and are at last free from fear of falling again and then recollecting the generosity and the mercy of the lord past or present or future are rapt away into that spark like prayer which no mortal can understand or describe yet sometimes the mind which is advancing to the true state of purity and has begun to be rooted in it can conceive all these kinds of prayer in a single action it cannot be understood but may be compared to the leaping of a flame it consists of a powerful and wordless pouring forth of prayer to god which the spirit with groanings that cannot be uttered sends up though not conscious of its content in that moment it conceives and puts forth what no one can describe and which the mind apart from that moment cannot remember so it happens that whatever state of life a man has reached he sometimes can offer pure and devout prayer even in the lowliest place where a man is repenting from fear of punishment and the judgement to come his supplications can enrich him with the same ardour of spirit as the man who has attained to purity of heart gazes upon god's blessing and is filled with an ineffable happiness as the lord said he begins to love the more who knows he has been forgiven the more 41 1 6 yet in progress towards goodness we ought to aim at those kinds of prayer which are offered from the vision of future good or from charity or at least to speak in a way more appropriate for beginners which are directed to acquiring a virtue or eradicating a sin we cannot attain the higher kinds of prayer unless our mind has little by little been elevated by an advance in the sort of petition which it offers 17 the lord himself deigned to be the author by his example of these four kinds of prayer in this too is fulfilled the text the things which jesus began both to do and teach he used supplication when he said father if it be possible let this cup pass from me 9 or as is sung in his person by the psalmist my god my god look upon me why hast thou for saken me 5 and texts like these he used prayer when he said i have magnified thee upon the earth i have finished the work 4i gf luke 7 147 222 western asceticism which thou gavest me to do and tor their sakes i sanctify myself that they also may be sanctified in the truth 9 he used intercession when he said father those whom thou hast given me i will that they also may be with me that they may see my glory which thou hast given me 9 and tather forgive them for they know not what they do 9 he used thanksgiving when he said c i confess to thee father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast re vealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight 9 and tather i thank thee that thou hast heard me but i knew that thou hearest me always 9 42 although he used these four kinds separately and at different times accommodating himself to the measure that we under stand he showed that in a perfect prayer they can be offered simultaneously in the long prayer which he offered and which we read at the end of st john's gospel the text is too long to insert here but the careful reader will find this to be so st paul in the epi tle to the philippians said the same though slightly changing the arrangement and showed that they ought sometimes to be offered altogether in one ardent offering in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god 9 43 here he particularly wanted to teach us that even in prayers of penitence and self offering thanksgiving should not be absent 1 8 out of these four kinds of prayer rises the loftier state of prayer formed by the contemplation of god alone and by a charity that burns like fire here the mind throws itself into love for god and converses familiarly with him as with its own father the first words of the lord's prayer our father 5 teach us to strive for this state when we confess the god and lord of all creation to be our father we confess that we have been called from a state of slavery to the state of adopted sons who art in heaven we pray that we may shrink from the earthly life in which we live as pilgrims and which divides us so far frpm our father and may long for that country where we know him to dwell that we may avoid everything unworthy of our sonship everything that might deprive us of our inheritance and make us liable to his severity in this loving state of son ship we shall direct our minds to our father's glory instead of our own interests thus 42 acts 1 1 matt 26 39 ps 29 1 john 17 4 19 and 24 luke 23 34 matt 1 1 25 6 john 1 1 14 1 2 phil 4 6 the conferences of cassian 223 hallowed be thy name we declare that our desire and our joy is his glory and in this we imitate our lord who said e he who speaketh for himself seeketh his own glory but he who seeketh the glory of him who sent him the same is true and there is no unrighteousness in him 9 44 this was st paul the chosen vessel's feeling when he wished that he could be accursed of christ if only christ's family might be multiplied and the people of israel be saved to god's glory the man who knows that death is not the end is confident in his wish to die for christ again c we rejoice when we are weak but ye are strong 45 it is no wonder if st paul for the glory of christ and the conversion of his brother jews and of the gentiles should want to be accursed of christ when even the prophet micah wanted to be a liar and to lose the inspiration of the holy spirit if the jews could escape the punishment and destruction which he had prophesied would that i were not a man that hath the spirit and that i rather spoke a lie and there was the case of the lawgiver moses who did not refuse to perish with his brothers who were doomed to die but said e l beseech thee o lord this people hath sinned a heinous sin either forgive them this trespass or if thou do not blot me out of thy book which thou hast written 46 hallowed be thy name may appropriately be taken thus the hallowing of god is our own sanctity so when we pray this prayer we are saying make me the kind of person worthy to understand and take thy great holiness to myself make my spiritual life such that in it thou canst be seen to be hallowed this is what happens when men see our good works and glorify our father who is in heaven 47 19 thy kingdom come the second petition of a pure heart that the father's kingdom may come at once there is a present kingdom where now christ reigns with his saints and in us this comes to pass when we eradicate wickedness and cast the devil's rule from our hearts and god begins to rule in us in fragrant goodness in chastity instead of adultery in serenity instead of rage in humility instead of pride and there is a future kingdom which is promised in due time to all the perfect to all the children of god when christ shall tell them e come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world to this kingdom the soul turns its gaze and its desires and prays thy kingdom come by the 44 john 7 18 45 ii cor 13 9 46 micah 2 1 1 ex 32 3 1 2 4 matt 5 16 224 western asceticism witness of its conscience the soul knows that when he sha appear it will share his glory no guilty person would dare t want or pray thy kingdom come 5 for no guilty person woul want to face the tribunal of the judge knowing that at hi coining he would receive prompt and condign punishmen instead of reward 20 thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven a petition of sons there can be no greater prayer than the prayer tha earth may be like heaven to pray thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven is to pray that men may be like angels tha as angels fulfil god's will in heaven men may fulfil his will instead of their own on earth no one can say this sincerel except one who believes that every circumstance favourable o unfavourable is designed by god's providence for his good ant that he thinks and cares more for the good of his people an their salvation than we do for ourselves it may be understoo thus the will of god is the salvation of all men according t that text of st paul who willeth all men to be saved and t come to the knowledge of the truth 48 it is of this saving wil that isaiah speaks in the name of god the father and all nr will shall be done when we pray thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven we are praying in other words that all th dwellers upon earth may be saved like the citizens of heaven through the knowledge of thee our father 21 give us this day our bread which is emoucrto whicl means supersubstantiap bread which another evangelist call daily 49 super substantial means that its quality is noble beyon other substances that its magnificence and holiness exceed tha 48 i tim 2 4 4 jerome inconsistently translated kiriovcrios by supersubstantialis in matthe and by qitotidianus in luke this piece of inconsistency was due no doubt t the same spiritualizing tendency which made origen deny that the brea intended could be material bread and it led to surprising consequence in the west when the identity of the greek word was forgotten an people believed the difference represented a real difference between th evangelists thus there was a discrepancy throughout the middle age between the fact that m the offices the lord 1 j prayer was said accord in to the matthaean version but with the apparently lucan won quotidianus for the offices preserved the wording existing before s jerome and the fact that the vulgate text of matthew had super substantiate nevertheless the mistaken word of jerome was never in serted into the offices except by the logically minded peter abelard wh ordered heloise and her convent to use the whole matthaean form an not mix matthew's text with the apparently lucan word st bernan objected to these proceedings the conferences of cassian 225 of other creatures daily means that without it we cannot live a spiritual life for a single day the word e this day shows that we must receive it daily that yesterday's supply is inadequate the word suggests that we should offer this prayer at all times there is no day on which we do not need to strengthen the heart of the inner man perhaps the word this day can be understood of c this life while we are mortal men give us this bread though we know that it is given to those who shall hereafter deserve it from thee we ask thee to grant it to us this day unless a man has deserved to receive it in this life he shall never partake of it in the life to come 22 forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors unspeakable mercy of god he has given us a form of prayer has taught us a way of moral life acceptable to himself has given with the form the command to pray always and so is eradicating the roots of anger and sorrow and above all this to men who pray he has provided an opportunity and revealed a way by which they may move god to pronounce a merciful judgement upon them you might say that he has given a power to make the judge's sentence lenient because by for giving others their offences we can draw him to forgive ours forgive us as we also have forgiven 50 and so with the con fidence of faith a man may ask pardon with this prayer if he has been merciful to his own debtors rather than the debtors of his lord some of us regrettably are inclined to be serene and merci ful about sins however grave committed by others against god and inexorable debt collectors when others commit trifling wrongs against ourselves the man who from his heart forgives not his brother who has offended by this prayer calls down not forgiveness but judgement and out of his own mouth asks to incur severer punishment saying forgive me as i also have forgiven if his request is answered surely he will be treated after his example with an implacable sentence if we want to be judged with mercy we must be merciful to those who have sinned against us only so much will be forgiven to us as we have forgiven those who have injured us however wickedly they have injured us there are some people who are so dreadfully aware of this that they silently omit the clause whenever the lord's prayer is recited congregationally in church afraid that they are binding so reading dimisimus rather than the dimittimus of several mss and gibson 226 western asceticism instead of excusing themselves they do not understand ho fruitless is the attempt with quibbles like these to make it judge of all men lenient he has willed to reveal to men wh pray to him the way in which he will judge because he wil not to be harsh and inexorable towards them he has declare his plan of judgement that we must judge our brother if t sins against us in just the way in which we wish him to judg us he shall have judgement without mercy on him who hat shown no mercy 51 23 and lead us not into temptation about the meaning this clause there is much discussion if we pray not to be allowe to be tempted how shall we have any power of resistance thei is a text everyone who is not tempted is not proved 5 an blessed is the man that endureth temptation 52 the claus lead us not into temptation therefore does not mean do nc allow us to be tempted but do not allow us to fall when w are tempted job was tempted but was not led into tempts tion for he did not call god foolish nor did he consent to th blasphemy to which the devil sought to lure him abraham w tempted joseph was tempted but neither was led into tempts tion because neither gave way to the tempter so finally deliver us from the evil one let us not be tempte of the devil above our capacity but with the temptation mak a way of escape that we may be able to bear it 53 24 you see the method and pattern of prayer put before u by the judge to whom we pray it contains no request for richer no thought of honours no petition for power no mention c physical health or length of life the author of eternity woul have us ask nothing ephemeral nothing paltry nothing trans ient he who neglects these petitions for eternity and prefers t ask for the evanescent insults the generous majesty of god meanness in prayer offends the judge instead of propitiatin him 25 the lord's prayer given to us with his authority seem to include the very pattern of a perfect prayer yet it carric those who use it to the higher state of prayer which i mentions before to that spark like and ineffable prayer which very fe men know by experience it transcends the senses is marked b no vocal expression whether silent or aloud but the mind illuminated by an outflowing of light from heaven does no define it in the narrow limit of human language with the sense unified it pours forth prayers almost with violence as a sprinj 5i james 2 13 52 ecclesiasticus 34 10 james i 12 53 1 con 10 i the conferences of cassian 227 pours forth fresh water and in a second's time darts up a prayer of such richness that afterwards the mind returned to normality cannot easily describe it this state of prayer our lord typified in those pattern prayers which he is said to have offered in silent retreat upon the mountain and when though here he gave an example impossible to imitate in an agony of prayer he let drops of blood fall upon the ground 26 can anyone however experienced explain adequately the origins and causes and diversities of compunction in spirit which strikes the spark in the mind and elevates it to prayer of fervent purity i will now give a few examples of these occasions of compunction so far as i can by god's aid remember them at the moment sometimes the verse of a psalm which we are singing sets off the spark sometimes the beauty of the cantor's voice rouses the dull mind to a concentrated prayer i know that the clarity and solemnity of the reader of the psalms can contribute to the fer vour of the congregation often the address or conference of some holy man has been fruitful in stirring the affections of the hearers i have known myself snatched away into true compunc tion of spirit by the death of a brother monk or of a dear friend or relative sometimes the memory of my own half heartedness and carelessness has elevated my soul no doubt there are countless occasions of this sort which can rouse the mind through god's grace from its drowsiness and half heartedness 27 it is just as difficult to describe how these compunctions arise from the inner sanctuary of the soul sometimes it happens because the soul is filled with an indescribable joy and cannot help breaking out into ejaculations and even the occupant of the next cell feels the power of the happiness in the heart sometimes the mind withdraws into a kind of secret abyss of silence sudden illumination leaves it speechless the awe struck spirit locks its feelings within or loses feeling altogether and pours out its longings to god in groanings that cannot be uttered sometimes a compunction of grief overwhelms it and the only way to express it is by a release of tears 28 germanus i have very little experience but even i have experienced something of this compunction of spirit sometimes tears will rise when i remember my sins and then i am visited by the lord and refreshed by the unspeakable joy which you have described and the joy by its very power has given me the assurance not to despair of forgiveness i believe there is no loftier state of prayer than this but the trouble is that 228 western asceticism it cannot be created when we choose sometimes when i am struggling as hard as i can to excite a compunction of penitence and i have decided to imagine my sins i fail altogether in the effort my eyes remain as dry as a flint and i cannot squeeze a drop of moisture out of them when i am granted tears i am happy but when i cannot call them at will i am cast down 29 isaac not all varieties of weeping are evoked by the same feeling there is a weeping because the heart is pricked by sin 54 there is a weeping which springs from contemplating eternal good and longing for future light and tears of joy and desire cannot help but break out as the soul is athirst for the mighty living god saying when shall i come to appear before the presence of god my tears have been my meat day and night 55 there is a weeping which rises not from the con sciousness of mortal sin but still from the fear of hell and the terrible judgement and the soul makes its own the prophetic prayer enter not into judgement with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justified there is a weeping caused not by self knowledge but by awareness of others sins and their lack of repentance so samuel is said to have wept for saul and the lord in the gospel and jeremiah before him are described as weeping for the city of jerusalem o that my head were water and mine eyes a fountain of tears and i will weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people and then there are the tears of the zoist psalm e l have eaten ashes for my bread and mingled my cup with weeping this was not caused by the same feelings as those of the penitent in psalm 6 but arose from the anxieties poverty and suffering of this life the common lot of the righteous in the world 56 30 you can squeeze tears out of dry eyes and with a hard heart but this is quite a different kind of weeping i do not believe that this sort of weeping is altogether without profit for the intention is good especially in people who have not yet been 54 as in the texts c i have laboured in my groanings every night i will wash my bed i will water my couch with my tears ps 6 6 and let tears run down like a torrent day and night give thyself no rest and let not the apple of thine eye cease lam 2 18 55 and woe is me that my sojourning is prolonged too long hath my soul been a sojourner ps 42 13 4 120 5 lxx 143 s 5 this is shown by the title as well as the text for the title reads a prayer of the poor when he was in distress and poured forth his prayer to god it is clear that the psalm is placed in the mouth of one of those poor men of whom the gospel speaks blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven matt 5 3 cf jer 9 1 ps 102 9 the conferences of cassian able to reach perfect knowledge or to be thoroughly purified of past and present sin but in people who have already progressed so far that they love goodness this kind of weeping never ought to be extracted unnaturally even if it succeeds it cannot rival spontaneous weeping as an occasion of elevated prayer it is more likely by the failure of the effort to depress the soul and drive it away from that intention towards heaven in which the prayerful and reverent mind ought to be stable it will force the soul to relax its concentration and instead go feebly after a weeping which is forced and futile 31 to teach you the feeling of true prayer i will give you not my opinion but that of st antony i have known him sometimes so long at his prayers that the sun rose before he had finished and i would hear him still in a rapture of spirit cry out to the sun why do you hinder me the rising of your light draws my mind away from the true light and st antony also uttered this heavenly inspired saying on the end of prayer that prayer is not perfect in which the monk understands himself and the words which he is praying i hardly dare to add anything from my own slender experi ence but so far as i can i will now point out how you can tell whether a prayer is one which the lord hears 32 if we pray unhesitatingly without any touch of hopeless ness to weaken the confident faith of the petitioner if in the act of earnest prayer we feel ourselves to have obtained our request we should not doubt that our prayers have effectively reached god a man will deserve to be heard in proportion as he believes that god is looking upon him and that god can grant his prayer it is impossible to minimize the lord's declara tion c whatsoever ye ask when ye pray believe that ye shall receive and it shall come to you 57 33 germanus i am sure that this confident faith in being heard springs from a clear conscience but sin yet pricks my heart i have no merit to plead for me how can i have this faith so confident as to presume that my prayers will be heard 34 isaac the gospels and the prophets teach us that prayers are heard for different reasons according to the different condition of the praying souls the lord declares first that if two agree their prayer will be heard if two of you shall agree upon earth touching any thing for which they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven 5 mark n 124 23o western asceticism he declares secondly that prayer in fulness of faith which he compared to a grain of mustard seed is heard if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and it shall be removed and nothing shall be impossible to you 5 again persevering prayers which the lord called im portunity will be heard c verily i say unto you that if not be cause of his friendship yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as much as he needs again almsgiving will be heard shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall pray for thee in the time of tribulation a reformed life or works of mercy will be heard loose the bands of wickedness undo the bundles that weigh down and after a few words which castigate the uselessness of a sterile fast then thou shalt call and the lord shall hear thee thou shalt cry and he shall say here am i sometimes the sufferer's prayer of agony is heard when i was in trouble i called unto the lord and he heard me and afflict not the stranger for if he crieth unto me i will hear him for i am merciful 58 you see how many different ways prayer may be made so that it is heard a hopeless conscience should make no one despair of being granted requests for a good which is saving to eternity and as i look at our plight i grant that we possess none of the virtues the right agreement between two people faith like a grain of mustard seed the works of charity which the prophet deserves yet cannot we have that importunity which he sup plies to all who want it and to mere importunity he has promised that he will answer we must pray then without faithlessness and believe that merely by keeping at our prayer we shall be granted what we have asked in accordance with god's will wanting to grant us the everlasting good of heaven the lord encourages us to con strain him by our importunity he does not scorn nor reject the importunate but welcomes and praises them and with his generosity promises to give them what they hopefully persevere to win ask and ye shall receive seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asketh re ceiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive and nothing shall be impos 58 matt 18 19 and 17 so luke 1 1 8 ecclesiasticus 29 15 isa 58 6 and 9 ps 120 i ex 22 21 and 27 the conferences of cassian 231 sible to you 59 so even if all the other grounds for confidence are lacking at least we can rouse our importunities for anyone without either merit or difficulty can do this the man who prays must not doubt that he will certainly not be heard so long as he doubts whether he is heard the example of blessed daniel whose prayer was answered twenty one days after he began to pray teaches us how unwearyingly we must petition the lord if we think the answer is slow in coming we should not cease from the intention with which we began it is possible that the lord is postponing his gracious reply for some useful reason or that the angel who was bringing us god's gift was delayed by the devil's resistance after he left the almighty's presence certainly the angel cannot bring the gift if he finds that we have stopped wanting it this could surely have hap pened to daniel unless he had persevered so courageously to the twenty first day a sense of hopelessness must not weaken our confident faith even when we imagine that our request has been refused let us wholeheartedly accept the lord's promise all things whatso ever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive we should consider the text of the evangelist st john where he removes all doubt about the matter this is the confidence which we have in him that whatsoever we ask according to his will he heareth us 60 he commands us to have this full un hesitating confidence in requests which suit not our own con venience and comfort but the lord's will the lord's prayer teaches us to include this in our prayers thy will be done thy will not our will remember the words of st paul we know not what to pray for as we ought 61 hence we understand that sometimes we ask for a thing which would militate against our salvation and that our request is refused by one who perceives our good more accurately and truly than we do ourselves this was clearly what happened to st paul when he prayed to be freed from satan's messenger who was permitted by the lord to buffet him for his good tor which i besought the lord thrice that he might depart from me and he said unto me a my grace is suf ficient for thee for strength is made perfect in weakness 62 even our lord felt this in his human person here giving us an example in prayer as in all eke when he prayed father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will 59 luke ii g io matt 21 22 17 20 60 i john 5 1 61 rom 8 26 62 ii cor 12 232 western asceticism but as thou wilt 63 though his will was certainly not discordant with his father's will tor he had come to save what was lost and to give his life a ransom for many and no man taketh my life from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again 64 the will of the father and the will of the son is everywhere one instructed by this example of our lord we ought to end every prayer with the proviso nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt 9 everyone is aware that the person who is praying with con centration cannot observe the three profound inclinations which are usual at the end of the office in monastic congregations 65 35 above all we ought to observe the teaching of the gospel to enter into our closet and shut the door and then pray to our father this has a spiritual meaning we pray in the closet when we have driven from the heart the turmoil of thoughts and cares and are offering our prayers like friends whispering inti mately the shut door means that we are praying silently to him who searches the heart and not the lips in secret means that with a concentrated heart and mind we display our peti tion to god alone and no devilish enemy can discover what we are asking so we ought to pray in deep silence this is partly to avoid disturbing monks praying nearby with murmur or noise but partly to prevent the demons who are especially alert to pounce on people at their prayers from knowing our intention in this fi 3 matt 26 39 for the ghristology see gibson's note ad toe 4 he speaks again in psalm 38 40 8 through the mouth of the blessed david of the absolute unity between his father's will and his own to do thy will o my god i have willed we read of the father god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and we read of the son who spared not his own son but gave him for our sins we read of the one who spared not his son but gave him for us all and of the other he was offered because he willed it himself matt 18 n and 20 28 john 10 18 john 3 16 gal 1 4 rom 8 32 isa 53 7 latin even in the mystery of the lord's resurrection we are taught of the harmony in god's working st paul declares that the father raised his body from the dead the son prophesied that he would raise the temple of his body destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up gal i i john 2 19 s this tailpiece is so curious that the roman edition of 1588 added an extra negative to provide the contrary sense none of the best manu scripts supports the extra negative and it is worse sense than the original the conferences of cassian 233 way we shall obey the command keep the doors of thy mouth from her who sleepeth in thy bosom 66 36 hence we should pray often but shortly if we dawdle about our prayers the subtle enemy might be able to sow a seed in our heart the true sacrifice to god is a contrite spirit the saving offerings and libations are the sacrifices of righteousness and praise the true acceptable victims and burnt offerings are those offered by a contrite and humble heart and if we practise this discipline and concentration of spirit which i have des cribed we shall be able effectually to sing let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice 9 67 dusk reminds me that we ought to join in our evening devotions in spite of my meagre experience i seem to have discoursed for a long time however brief it has been in pro portion to the profundity and difficulty of the material he ended we felt awe and wanted him to continue but after we had celebrated vespers we received his promise that at dawn he would treat the subject further and so in happiness at what we had learnt and at his promise of more we returned to our cells to lie down for a little sleep we felt that we had been shown the excellence of prayer but that we had yet to learn fully the method and the power by which we could acquire or preserve the state of unceasing prayerfulness conference 10 the second conference of abba isaac on prayer 1 i have tried however unskilfully to describe with god's help the sublime customs of the hermits the order of my discourse now forces me to insert a passage which may seem like a pimple on a lovely body yet i have no doubt that less edu cated readers will learn much from it about the image of almighty god which genesis describes so i insert it with a view to a better understanding of a great doctrine which cannot be misapprehended without blasphemy and heresy 2 the clergy of egypt observe the feast of epiphany as the time of our lord's birth as well as the time of his baptism and micah 7 5 67 ps 141 z 234 western asceticism unlike the western church with its two separate festivals keep both commemorations upon the same day they keep a custom of immemorial antiquity that after epiphany the bishop of alexandria sends a letter to every church and monastery in egypt declaring the dates for the beginning of lent and easter day a few days after the first conference with abba isaac arrived the customary festal letter from bishop theophilus of alexandria 68 besides declaring the date of easter he included in the letter a long refutation of the absurd heresy of the anthropomorphites nearly all the monks in egypt being un educated and therefore holding wrong ideas received this with bitterness and hostility and a large majority of elders from all the ascetic brotherhood decreed that the bishop was guilty of a grave and hateful heresy because by denying that almighty god was formed in the fashion of a man when scripture bears clear witness that adam was created in his image he seemed to be attacking the text of holy scripture even the hermits in the desert of scete who were more educated and more spiritually advanced than any other egyptian monks rejected the letter of theophilus the priests who were presiding over three of the four churches in scete would not allow the letter to be read at their meetings and the only exception was abba paphnutius who was the priest of my own congregation 3 among those caught by the error was a monk named sarapion who had for many years lived a life of strict discipline and had achieved the leading of a truly good life almost first among monks in merit and in years in the desert equally he was almost first in his ignorant prejudice against orthodox believers the saintly priest paphnutius used many exhortations to bring him back to the true belief but unsuccessfully to sarapion the view seemed a novelty not found in tradition it chanced that a deacon of great learning named photinus arrived from cappadocia with the object of visiting the brothers in scete paphnutius gave him a warm welcome and to support the doctrine contained in the letter of bishop theophilus he led photinus into the middle of the congregation and in the pre sence of all the brothers asked how the catholic churches of the east understood the text in genesis let us make man after our image and likeness 9 photinus explained how all the leaders of the churches understood the text spiritually not literally nor crudely and made a long speech adducing numer in the year 399 gen i 26 the conferences of cassian 235 ous proofs from scripture that immeasurable incompre hensible invisible majesty cannot be limited by a human frame or likeness his nature is incorporeal uncompounded simple and cannot be seen by human eyes nor conceived adequately by a human mind at last old sarapion was moved by the numerous and con vincing assertions of this learned man and consented to the traditional faith of catholics abba paphnutius and the rest of us felt great joy at his assent joy that the lord had not allowed a man of such age and goodness who had erred in simple ignorance to end his days unorthodox in the faith when we stood up to give thanks to the lord in prayer the old man felt mentally bewildered at having to pray because he could no longer sense in his heart the anthropomorphic image of god which he had always before his mind's eye when praying suddenly he broke into bitter weeping and sobbing and throw ing himself prostrate on the ground with groans cried woe is me they have taken my god away from me and i have none to grasp and i know not whom to adore or to address germanus and i were deeply moved by this scene and with the effect of the last conference still in our hearts we returned to abba isaac when we reached his presence we addressed him thus 4 your last conference on prayer stirred our desire to put aside all else and return to you but this new incident has strengthened the desire still further abba sarapion misled by skilful demons as we believe fell into grave error and this has cast us down into a state of hopelessness we are thinking how for fifty years he has so admirably lived as a great ascetic in this desert and yet through ignorance not only lost the merit of that life but incurred a risk of eternal death so first we want to know how and why this grave error crept upon him secondly we ask you to teach us how we can reach the state of prayer of which earlier you taught us at length and so finely your earlier conference made us admire that state but did not show us how to achieve or secure it 5 isaac it is not surprising that a very simple man who had never received any instruction on the being and nature of god could be caught and deceived even until now by an error which he mis learnt a long time ago this error is not as you suppose a modern illusion of demons but an inheritance from the ignorance of the old heathen they used customarily and erroneously to worship demons fashioned in the likeness of men 236 western asceticism and even now they think to worship god in his majesty the in comprehensible and indescribable in the limited form of some statue and they suppose they have nothing to worship unless they have in front of them a statue which they can continually address in their devotions can mentally conceive and can keep in front of their eyes against this error is directed the text and they changed the glory of the incorruptible god into the like ness of the image of corruptible man 5 and jeremiah says my people have changed their glory for an idol 70 this is the way in which this error has been implanted in some men nevertheless in people whose souls have never been polluted by heathenism the error is contracted by ignorance under cover of this text let us make man in our image and likeness hence the so called anthropomorphite heresy has risen out of the detestable interpretation of this text a heresy which maintains obstinately and perversely that the limitless and simple nature of god is fashioned in human form and features anyone well instructed in catholic doctrine will detest the idea as heathen blasphemy and in detesting it he will come to that pure state of prayer where the person will allow i need not say no effigy of god to be mingled in his prayers and will not even admit the recollection of a saying or an action or the outline of a character 6 i said in my first conference that every soul attains the kind of prayer proportionate to its purity for it can abandon the contemplation of the earthy and material only in proportion as its state of purity carries it upwards to see jesus in the mind's eye jesus still in the humility of his incarnate life or jesus glorified and coming in majesty jesus coming in his kingdom shall not be seen by men who are restrained by a weakness like that of the jews and therefore cannot say with st paul c and if we have known christ after the flesh yet now we know him so no more 71 only those of purest sight look upon his divinity men who have climbed up from earthly acts and thoughts and have gone apart with him into a high and lonely mountain jesus untroubled by any earthly thought and passion and sin exalted in the purity of his faith and goodness discloses the brightness of his face and likeness to men who can look upon him because their souls are pure inhabitants of cities and villages and hamlets men engaged in the ordinary and virtuous pursuits of life sometimes see jesus but they cannot see him with the distinctness possible to 70 rom 1 123 jer a 1 1 i ii cor 5 16 the conferences of cassian 237 those who can climb up with him upon the mount of saintliness as did peter james and john so in the wilderness he appeared to moses and spoke with elijah he wanted to teach us this and leave us an example of perfect purity as the source of holiness a source unpolluted like a spring of fresh water he did not need to go apart in the wilderness to attain that perfect purity no dirt no stain from the crowds of human society could lessen the fulness of his purity of heart for he it is who cleanses and purges all pollution yet he went apart alone to the mountain to pray he gave an example of withdrawal to teach us that if we want to address god with a heart of integrity we should go apart from all crowd and tumult that disturbs our peace and there though still mortal men we may in part succeed in attaining at least the shadow of the bliss promised to the saints in the future and god may be to us all in all 72 7 then our saviour's prayer wherein he prayed the father for his disciples will be truly fulfilled in us c that the love wherein thou lovedst me may be in them and they in us 9 and that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us this unity will be when that perfect love of god wherewith he first loved us 9 73 has passed into the affections of our own hearts so his prayer will be fulfilled and we believe that that prayer cannot fail of its effect then god shall be all our love all we desire and seek and follow all we think all our life and speech and breath the unity which now is between father and son shall be poured into our feelings and our minds and as he loves us with a pure sincere unbreakable charity we on our side shall be linked to him by a lasting affection that nothing can spoil in that union whatever we breathe or think or speak is god so the end of his prayer is attained in us that they all may be one as we are one i in them and thou in me that they also may be made perfect in one and father those whom thou hast given me i will that where i am they may also be with me this should be the aim and purpose of the solitary to seek to possess in some measure even while mortal man the first bridal gifts from the heavenly country and its glory i repeat this is the end of all true goodness that the mind may every day be lifted beyond the material sphere to the realm of spirit until the whole life and every little stirring of the heart becomes one continuous prayer 72 i cor 15 28 73 john x7 2i 6 i john 4 10 238 western asceticism 8 germanus we were bewildered by the first conference and returned to you for further explanation but now our be wilderment has grown certainly this doctrine stirs us to long for the bliss of heaven but the more we yearn the more we despair for we still do not know how to achieve the sort of disciplined life which can enable us to reach this lofty goal i beg you to be patient and allow me to explain perhaps at some length what we had begun to consider during our daily medi tations in our cell i know that you are unused to being troubled by the silly questions of weak brothers like ourselves yet it is worth bringing these silly questions into the open so that the absurdity in them may be corrected we think that every art or science must begin with rudiments easy and suitable for the uninitiated a man must be trained so to speak on the milk of the intellect and thereby may grow step by step from ignorance to education first he acquires the more obvious principles passes the gateway to his subject and thereby can chmb without difficulty to the pinnacles of know ledge a boy cannot frame sentences until he has learnt the alphabet properly he cannot become a quick reader unless he can first read short and simple nouns the man ignorant of grammar will never be able to write elegant prose or to become a sound philosopher this higher discipline in which we learn to cleave to god continually must doubtless have first principles foundations on which a man may build to raise the lofty tower i think though hesitantly that its first principles consist in learning by what meditations god may be grasped and conceived and then how to preserve this thought whatever it is uninterruptedly and i am sure that this uninterrupted preservation is the true perfection of the discipline we want you to show us material for this recollectedness by which god is conceived in the mind and the conception is re tained permanently thereby we may keep it in front of us and when we feel we have fallen away may at once be able to return without any delay or ignorant meandering of the thoughts sometimes when my mind has wandered away from con templating god i wake up as if from a sleep as sound as death i look round like a drowsy man just out of bed for the subject matter to recreate recollectedness the process of finding the material distracts and delays me before i find the vision again my purpose of heart is beginning to fade i am sure it happens the conferences of cassian 239 because i do not keep before my eyes some special intention in the way of a formula to which the wandering mind could be recalled from its travels so to say a quiet harbour after a long and stormy voyage thus the mind constantly hampered by this ignorance teeters to and fro like a drunkard and does not even grasp the spiritual thought which comes to it unasked and unsought as it goes on receiving one sensation after another it is unconscious of their arrival their origin or their departure 9 isaac your question is intricate and the fact that you have asked it proves you to have made headway towards purity of mind to ask questions still more to use a delicate introspec tion in this matter is only possible to a person who by mental zeal and alertness has reached a stage where he can understand the complications of the problem to a person whose constant attempts at a disciplined life have given him the experience whereby he may knock at the gates of mental purity i see that you are no longer standing at the outer gate of true prayer but are knocking at its inner door and have already pushed it half open a visitor who has reached the main hall of a house can easily be shown its inner rooms and with god's guidance i think it will be easy to bring you to the heart of true prayer i believe you will allow no obstacle to hinder your self examina tion the man who knows what questions to ask is on the verge of understanding the man who is beginning to understand what he does not know is not far from knowledge so i am not afraid of the charge of speaking irreverently or betraying secrets if i now disclose what i omitted from my earlier conference i think that by god's grace your own study would have taught you the way even if you had no words of mine to help you 10 you made an admirable comparison between spiritual discipline and the education of children a child cannot recog nize or make letters before he has become used to seeing them every day in wax copies i must give you the formula for con templation if you carefully keep this formula in front of you and learn to recollect it all the time you can use it to mount to the contemplation of high truth every monk who looks for continual recollection of god uses this formula for meditation and with the object of driving every other sort of thought from his heart you cannot keep the formula before you unless you are free from all bodily care the formula was given us by a few of the oldest fathers who remained they did not communicate it except to a very few 240 western asceticism who were athirst for the true way to maintain an unceasing recollection of god it is to be ever set before you the formula is o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me 5 74 this verse has rightly been selected from the whole bible for this purpose it fits every mood and temper of human nature every temptation every circumstance it contains an invocation of god a humble confession of faith a reverent watchfulness a meditation upon our frailty a confidence in god's answer an assurance of his ever present support the man who continually invokes god as his guardian is aware that he is always at hand the formula contains a fervent charity a fearful contemplation of the devil's power a regard for the defender's succour which alone can relieve the beleaguered soul from the devil's siege by day and night the verse is an impregnable battlement a shield and coat of mail which no spear can pierce souls sunk in accidie or worry or melancholy thoughts of any kind find the cure of despair in this verse which shows them god's watch over their struggles and their prayers souls happy in their spiritual pro gress it warns against a bubble like complacency assuring them that only with god's protection can they keep what they have won teaching them not merely to ask his help but to ask it speedily i repeat each of us whatever his condition of spiritual life needs to use this verse the man who wants to be helped in all circumstances and at all times shows that he needs god to help him in prosperity and happiness as much as in suffering and sorrow he needs to be delivered from the one and main tained in the other for he knows that frail human nature cannot remain unimpaired in either state without god's help suppose i feel gluttonous i look round for food unknown among hermits in the middle of the desert i scent the cooking of a dish fit for kings and against my better will i cannot help hungering for it then i must say immediately c o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me or i am tempted to eat supper too early or am struggling to eat no more than the right and customary quantity i must cry out o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me i need severe fasts to quench lust yet i dare not undertake them through the delicacy or dryness of my stomach and so to quieten the lust without severe fasting i must pray c o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me 5 1 go to 74 p s 70 1 the conferences of cassian 24 supper at the correct time and shudder at the food and cannot eat what i must eat to live then i must sigh o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me 3 perhaps i want to keep my heart stable by forcing myself to read the bible but a headache stops me by nine o'clock in the morning i have fallen asleep with my head on the page and i am driven to go to bed before the appointed hour and so fail to say the full office and the proper series of psalms again i must say c o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me perhaps night after night i suffer some devilish in somnia and am exhausted from lack of sleep gain no refreshment from my night's rest i must breathe c o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me perhaps if i have not yet tamed the flesh some sudden temptation against chastity comes upon me softly at night and i must prevent this invading fire from burning up the fragrant flowers of chastity so i must call c o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me perhaps i feel the heat of passion to have cooled then this virtue nay this grace for it is a gift of god i must keep within me by saying carefully c o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me perhaps temptations to anger or avarice or melancholy afflict me and force me to disturb my calm state so pleasant to me i must prevent myself being bitter by crying aloud 6 o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me per haps some temptation to accidie or vanity or pride or to des pise the half heartedness of other monks creeps upon the mind to stop this devilish suggestion i must pray with deep con trition c o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me perhaps i have repented long and so have pricked the bubble of pride and gained the grace of humility and simplicity so that the foot of pride may not again c come against me and c the hand of the sinner disturb me 75 and that satisfaction at my success may not cause still worse moral damage i must call with my whole heart c o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me perhaps wandering thoughts career about the soul like boiling water and i cannot contest them nor can i offer prayer without silly mental images interrupting it i feel so dry that i seem incapable of spiritual feeling and many sighs and groans cannot 75 p s 36 11 242 western asceticism save me from dreariness i must needs say c o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me perhaps by some joyous rapture i feel that the holy spirit has visited me and i have gained a re directed purpose a concentration of mind a liveliness of heart and through these overflowing sensations i discern a sudden disclosure by the lord of sacred truths hidden from me till now to dwell upon these truths for more than a moment i must be careful to keep praying c o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me perhaps in the night i am encompassed by appearances of unclean spirits and in my turn am thrown into a despair even of life and salvation i shall find in the whole hearted praying of that verse a safe fortress for the fugitive c o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me then the lord restores and consoles me and i feel that he is garrisoning me with his countless hosts of angels and suddenly i can dare to go out to face the enemy and provoke them to fight when a moment before i was trembling with fear of death and shudder ing in mind and body at their touch or proximity to abide by god's grace in this strength and courage i must say with my whole heart c o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me continuously and ceaselessly in adversity that we may be delivered in prosperity that we may be preserved but not puffed up we ought to send up this prayer meditate on it never stop turning it over within your breast whatever work or ministry or journey you are undertaking go on praying it while you are going to sleep or eating or in the last necessities of nature think on it it will be a saving formula in your heart will guard you from the attacks of demons will cleanse you from the stains of earthly life lead you to contemplate the unseen things of heaven and carry you up to the ineffable glow of prayer which very few have experienced sleep ought to catch you thinking about this verse until you are so moulded by its use that you pray it when asleep when you wake it should be your first thought it should force you from your bed to your knees and thence send you out to your daily work there to be always with you you should think on it in moses words 76 at home or on a journey going to bed or rising from bed you should write it on the doors of your lips the walls of your house the sanctuary of your breast whether you kneel down to pray or whether you rise up from 6 7 the conferences of cassian 243 praying and turn to the needs of your daily life this should be your prayer ii this formula the mind should go on grasping until it can cast away the wealth and multiplicity of other thoughts and restrict itself to the poverty of this single verse so you will attain with ease that gospel beatitude which holds first place among the other beatitudes blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven this noble poverty will fulfil the prophet's saying the poor and needy shall praise the name of the lord 77 truly what higher or holier poverty can there be than this that a man knowing he is defenceless of his own asks help for daily life from another's generosity and realizes his life and being to depend every moment on god's help such a one truly confesses himself the beggar of the lord 5 like the psalmist who said i am a beggar and a poor man and god helps me 7s so by god's light he mounts to the manifold knowledge of god and thereafter to feed on mysteries loftier and more sacred the prophet said the high hills are a refuge for the stags and the rocks for the hedgehogs 5 79 1 think this meaning of the text is appropriate for this reason a man who perseveres in sim plicity and innocence is aggressive to none and content to defend himself from being spoiled by his enemies like the hedge hog hiding under a rock he is protected by his continual recol lection of the lord's passion and meditation upon this verse of the psalms with the same spiritual intention the book of proverbs speaks about hedgehogs the hedgehogs are a feeble folk who have made their homes in the rocks 80 nothing is feebler than a christian nothing weaker than a monk who for wrong may take no vengeance nor even indulge mild feelings of annoyance however concealed within his breast the man who in his moral ascent possesses simple innocence and yet the gift of wisdom has satan crushed like a poisonous viper beneath his feet and as a stag browsing upon high pastures his quick intelligence feeds upon the lofty mysteries revealed by the prophets and apostles there with deep compunction he will make the thoughts of the psalms his own he will sing them no longer as verses com posed by a prophet but as born of his own prayers at least he should use them as intended for his own mouth and know that they were not fulfilled temporarily in the prophet's age and circumstances but are being fulfilled in his daily life there are 77 matt 5 3 ps 74 21 78 p s 40 17 lxx 79 p s 104 1 8 so prov 30 26 lxx 244 western asceticism times when a man understands god's scriptures with the clarity with which a surgeon understands the body when he opens up the marrow and the veins these are the times when our experi ence seems to show us the meaning by practical proof before we understand it intellectually for example if we have the same attitudes of heart wherein the psalmist wrote or sang his psalms we shall become like the authors and be aware of the meaning before we have thought it out instead of after the force of the words strikes us before we have rationally examined them and when we use the words we remember by a kind of meditative association our own circum stances and struggles the results of our negligence or earnest ness the mercies of god's providence or the temptations of the devil the subtle and slippery sins of forgetfulness or human frailty or unthinking ignorance all these feelings we find ex pressed in the psalms we see their texts reflected in the clear glass of our own moral experience and with that experience to teach us we do not hear the words so much as discern the meaning intuitively we will not merely recite them like texts committed to memory but bring them out from the depths of the heart as an expression of moral reality so the mind shall attain that purest of pure prayers to which our earlier conference led so far as the lord deigned to grant us the prayer which looks to see no visual image uses no mind nor words the prayer wherein like a spark leaping from a fire the mind is rapt upward and destitute of the aid of the senses or of anything visible or material pours forth its prayer to god with groanings and sighs that cannot be uttered 12 germanus you have most clearly explained the system of spiritual discipline for which i asked and perfect prayer itself there can be nothing more sublime than to fold the recol lection of god into the little space of a meditation upon a single verse to summarize all the prayerful feelings in one sentence now we beg you to expound our one remaining problem you have given us this verse as a kind of formula how can we keep it permanently before us by god's grace we have been liberated from the stupidities of secular thoughts how may we grasp spiritual thoughts and never let them go 13 when the mind has begun to take the meaning of a psalm it passes on unawares and unintentionally to some other text of scripture when it has just begun to meditate upon that text and has half considered it its attention is caught by another passage and it forgets all about the earlier matter for meditation the conferences of cassian 245 and so it goes on hopping from text to text from psalm to psalm from gospel to epistle and thence to a prophetic book and thence to a narrative in the historical books of the old testament meandering vaguely through the bible choosing nothing and grasping nothing on purpose considering no text to its depth the mind becomes a dilettante a taster of spiritual meanings not a creator or owner of them at the time of the office it totters about like a drunkard its worship ever in adequate during the prayers it is thinking about a psalm or lesson during the singing of the psalter it is thinking about something quite outside the text of the psalm during the lesson it is thinking about something that has to be done or remember ing something that has been done so it receives or rejects nothing in a disciplined and orderly manner but seems to be knocked about by haphazard assaults powerless to keep or to linger over the text which pleases it we therefore need to know how to worship adequately by these means and how permanently to hold this verse which you gave us as a formula then our feelings would not rise and fall hither and thither under their own impetus but would respond to the control of the will 14 isaac i think that enough was said on this subject in our earlier discussion but because you want me to repeat it i will give a brief summary on how to make the heart stable three things make the wandering mind stop wandering watching meditation prayer when used purposefully and assi duously this is only possible if the anxieties and worries of this life are first put away through tirelessly engaging in work undertaken not for monetary gain but for the religious needs of the coenobium this is the only way to obey st paul's command tray without ceasing 9 he prays too little who only prays when he is on his knees but he never prays who while on his knees is in his heart roaming far afield therefore what we wish to be while praying we ought to be before we begin to pray the praying mind cannot help being fashioned by its earlier condition cannot help its earlier thoughts lifting it upward to heaven or pulling it downward to earth thus far abba isaac to our wonder gave his second con ference on the nature of prayer he gave his teaching about meditating on that one little verse as an outline for beginners 246 western asceticism germanus and i admired the teaching and wanted to follow it for we believed it to be a short and easy way but when we tried it we found it harder to observe than our previous method of wandering haphazardly through the bible and meditating on a variety of different texts however it is certain that a man is not incapable of perfec tion or purity of heart because he cannot read perfection and purity are available for anyone who uses one brief text if he uses it with a purpose of heart strong and unwavering towards god conference n first conference of abba chaeremon on perfection 1 after i first learnt the faith i lived in a monastery in syria and there after making a certain amount of progress i began to look for that higher grace which leads to a perfect life i therefore resolved to go to egypt at once and travel through it to the furthest fastnesses of the thebaid with the object of visiting the many holy people whose fame had re sounded through the earth if i could not imitate them i might at least learn from them after a long voyage i came with germanus to an egyptian city named thennesus it is a town surrounded by the sea on one side and salt marshes on the other and since the inhabitants are so short of land they devote themselves to earning a living by seafaring and trade when they want to build a house they have to lay its foundations by bringing soil by sea from a dis tance 2 on our arrival god blessed us for he had brought to the town a saintly and eminent bishop named archebius archebius had been plucked out of a society of hermits and made bishop of panephysis but he had maintained as a bishop the rigorous discipline of the hermitage altered nothing of his humble manners and did not flatter himself on his high office on the contrary he said that he had been made a bishop not because he deserved it but because he had been expelled from his hermit's way as unworthy to remain inasmuch as he had tried for thirty seven years to reach purity of heart and had failed he had come to thennesus on the business of electing a bishop and welcomed us warmly like a father when he heard the conferences of cassian 247 that we wanted to visit the fathers in the distant parts of egypt he said to us first of all come and see the old men who live near our monastery they are crippled with age but you have only to look at them to see that they are holy men and even to learn a great deal from them a saintly life is more educative than a sermon and by their lives you can learn the lesson which i am sorry to say i can no longer teach you be cause i have lost it if i cannot produce for you the pearl of great price i can at least show you where you may best find it and i think that this may partly make amends for my own inability to help you 3 so he took his staff and his scrip like all egyptian monks starting a journey and guided us to his own city of panephysis the land round here used to be very rich and rumour says that it used to supply the emperor's court with food but in an earthquake the sea flooded in destroyed the villages and turned its fertile lands into salt marshes some people there apply literally to the country the verse of the psalms which was intended allegorically he hath turned rivers into a wilderness and the springs of waters into a thirsty land a fruitful land into salt for the wickedness of them that dwell therein 81 the flood waters had turned the hillocks of higher ground on which villages had been built into islands and since the inhabitants had fled these places were suitable for holy men wanting to live alone among the hermits of the region three old men named chae remon nesteros and joseph had lived therefor the longest time 4 archebius chose to take us to see chaeremon first because his cell was nearest to archebius's own cell and because he was the eldest of all being over a hundred years old though mentally he was still vigorous his back was so crippled by age and by constant kneeling in prayer that he could only move by crawling on hands and knees like an infant his limbs were useless defunct yet he still kept the rigour of his rule we gazed at his face which was wonderful and then at his method of moving we humbly asked him to teach us and said that we had come simply to learn the rules of the spiritual life he sighed deeply and said what can i teach you in my old age i have become so weak that i have softened my earlier aus terities and consequently destroyed my confidence that i could teach how can i presume to preach what i do not practise si ps 107 33 4 248 western asceticism or tell someone else to do something which i myself do half heartedly or not at all that is why i have refused to allow any younger man to live with me in my old age because i am afraid that his discipline would be weakened by my example a teacher will never exercise an effective authority unless he drives it into the heart of his pupil by his actions 5 at this we felt very embarrassed and replied the con ditions of life here and of living as a hermit to this age are conditions which a robust young man would find difficulty in enduring and ought to teach us all we need even if you tell us nothing we have already learnt a lesson from you still we beg you to put aside your silence for a short time and tell us how to grasp at the goodness we see in you how to reverence it at least since we cannot copy it as perhaps you know we are spiritually backward and do not deserve to have our request granted but at least the trouble of this long journey from the monastery at bethlehem trouble caused by our wish to learn your ways and to make spiritual progress ought to persuade you to answer 6 then the blessed chaeremon said three things enable men to control their sins fear of hell or the law of the land hope for the kingdom of heaven and the love of goodness for its own sake we read that fear hates the touch of evil c the fear of the lord hateth evil 9 and hope repels the onslaught of every sin c a11 those who hope in him shall not fail 9 and love does not fear downfall into sin for charity never faileth and charity covereth a multitude of sins 9 82 that is why st paul summarized all salvation in those three virtues now abideth faith hope charity these three faith is what makes us shun sin from fear of its punishment in the future judgement hope calls our mind away from the present life and the pleasures of the body to seek our reward in heaven charity kindles the mind to love christ and the goodness of the spirit and so to hate whatever is contrary to them these three virtues which call us to stop sinning seem all to aim at the same goal but they differ widely in excellence properly speaking faith and hope are qualities of men who are on the way towards goodness but as yet do not love it charity is a quality of god and of men who have received into their beings the image and likeness of god god alone acts from love of goodness for its own sake without being moved by fear or prov 8 13 ps 34 22 i cor 13 8 i peter 4 8 the conferences of cassian 249 hope of reward the lord said solomon has done all things for his own sake 83 out of pure goodness he bestows his abounding good on saint and sinner wrong cannot weary him nor sinfulness provoke him for he ever abides the same pure and unchanging goodness 7 a man who is aiming at the perfect life will climb up from the first rung the fear which is rightly called servile as it was said when ye have done all things say we are unprofitable servants 84 and will mount to the rung of hope the man who hopes is like a paid servant not a slave for he is secure in his status and exemption from servile punishment looks for a wage in return for his labour is conscious of his services and expects payment under contract and therefore cannot be like a son who loves his father trusts his father's generosity and never doubts that all his father's goods are his own the prodigal who had lost his father's goods and the name of son did not dare to aspire to this state of sonship e l am no more worthy to be called thy son 85 he fed upon the husks that the swine did eat and was not filled it means the squalid food of sin and then he returned to his right mind was stricken with repentance and began to loathe the filth of the sty and to fear starvation so like a slave he began to want to be a paid servant and said how many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare while i perish with hunger i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants but his father ran out to meet him and listened to his humble and penitent words with a family affection deeper than his son's and lifted him above the state of a hired servant and restored him to his sonship we likewise ought to mount quickly upward in the strength of a love that cannot be broken to be sons who believe that all their father's goods are their own who are made in the image and likeness of their father and who like his true son can say all things that the father hath are mine st paul says it of us all things arc yours whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours our saviour commanded and called us to this likeness be ye perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect 86 83 prov 16 14 84 luke 17 10 ss luke 15 19 86 john 16 15 i cor 3 22 matt 5 48 250 western asceticism in people on the way to the perfect life there can come moments when the love of goodness is interrupted the mind through half heartedness or happiness or some passing pleasure relaxes its tautness loses its fear of hell and hope of future reward sometimes fear and hope can each be stages leading to an advance one who has begun by avoiding sin out of fear of hell or hope of heaven can pass to the rung of charity tear is not in love but perfect love casteth out fear for fear hath torment but he who feareth is not perfect in love let us therefore love because god first loved us 5 87 therefore we can only ascend to the truly perfect way if as he first loved us simply to save us we love him simply be cause he has loved us we must strive earnestly to pass from fear to hope from hope to the love of god and of goodness for its own sake and as we reach this last stage we shall grasp goodness immovably so far as that is possible for human nature 8 there is a lot of difference between the man who eradi cates sin by fear of hell or hope of god's reward and the man who loves god and therefore shrinks from wickedness possesses purity simply because he loves purity and acts out of a pleasure in present virtue the reason is that in this second state the man acts in just the same way when there are no observers he prevents secret thoughts of evil entering the heart simply be cause the heart loves goodness whatever is contrary to good ness is not received into the heart indeed is abhorred to hate sin from a love of present good is different from avoiding illicit passion for the sake of future gain the one is afraid of loss in the present the other of punishment in the future it is better not to want to leave the good because you like the good than not to consent to evil because you are afraid of evil in one the good act is voluntary in the other it is extracted by a kind of com pulsion based on punishment or reward the man who abstains from sin out of fear will return to what he likes when the fear evaporates therefore he will never achieve a stable character of goodness will not secure a tranquil chastity will always be liable to onslaughts wherever there is war there will be risk of wounds a soldier in a battle however bravely he fights however many mortal wounds he inflicts on the enemy cannot help sometimes being hurt by the enemy's sword but a conqueror of sin who has won through to peace will keep the character which is now all his own be 87 1 john 4 18 19 the conferences of cassian 25 cause he believes no loss to be worse than the loss of his inmos chastity he regards any grave fall from virtue as a seven punishment and therefore thinks nothing more precious thai his present purity so the presence or absence of other people will make n difference to his conduct everywhere he bears round with bin his conscience as the judge of his actions and inner thoughts listening intently to hear its voice knowing that it cannot fo avoided or cheated or escaped 9 a man can only live according to his conscience if in relies upon god's help and not upon his own endeavours bu if he does live according to his conscience he will then begin t pass from the states of servile fear and hireling hope to th state of an adopted son moved by neither fear nor greed bu by never failing charity the lord administered a rebuke ii which he taught where fear and charity were each appropriate a son knoweth his own father and a servant feareth his lord and if i be a father where is my honour and if i be a lord where is my fear the slave must fear his master because i knowing his lord's will he has done things worthy of stripes h shall be beaten with many stripes 88 in charity then man attains the image and likeness of god and delights in goodness for its own sake he possesses a measure of god's patience and gentleness he refrains from anger at th faults of others sympathizes with their weaknesses and inter cedes for their pardon he remembers that for many years h suffered from the same passions until the lord's mercy savec him seeing that it is grace and not works which delivered hiir from concupiscence he will know how to show mercy insteac of wrath to the erring in serenity of heart he will sing to goc the verse of the psalms thou hast broken my chains i wil offer to thee the sacrifice of praise and except the lord hac helped me my soul had almost dwelt in hell in this humbl spirit he will be able to obey even that gospel command o perfection love your enemies do good to them that hate you and pray for them which persecute and slander you so god will grant us the reward to be made in the image anc likeness of god and to be called his sons c that ye may be son of your father which is in heaven who maketh his sun to ris upon the good and the evil his rain to fall upon the just anc unjust this was the feeling in which st john said e that w may have confidence in the day of judgement because as he is 88 mal i 6 luke 12 143 252 western asceticism so are we also in this world 9 the only way in which our weak and frail human nature can resemble his nature is by pouring out the loving heart in tranquillity to good and bad just and unjust by doing good because it is good so we come to the true state of adopted sons of god of which st john wrote everyone that is born of god doth not sin for his seed is in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god and e we know that everyone who is born of god sinneth not but his birth from god preserveth him and the wicked one toucheth him not 89 this last text he cannot sin 5 must only be understood of deadly sin not of all sin in another text st john says that we should not even pray for a man who does not want to be rid of deadly sin if a man knows his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death let him ask and he will give him life for them that sin not unto death there is a sin unto death i do not say that he should pray for that from sins not unto death the most faithful servants of christ however vigilantly they live cannot altogether keep themselves free and of them st john says c lf we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us and if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us 90 no holy man can prevent himself falling into the little sins sins of speech and thought of ignorance and forgetfulness sins which we do not will and sins that we do will sins which take us by surprise they are far from being deadly sins still they bring guilt 10 when a man has come to love goodness and to imitate god then he will be clothed in the lord's spirit of compassion and pray for his enemies father forgive them they know not what they do 91 not to be merciful and sympathetic with others faults but to be rigid and censorious is clear proof of a soul sunk down in sin no one like this can obtain perfection of heart because he is without that instrument which enables the full requirements of the law to be obeyed as st paul said bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of christ 5 nor does he possess charity which is not grieved is not puffed up thinketh no evil endureth all things beareth all things a righteous heart pitieth the life of his beasts but the heart of the ungodly is without pity a monk is certain to fall into the same sins which he mercilessly condemns when he finds them in another a rigid king shall fall into evil and one who stops 89 ps 116 16 17 matt 5 44 5 ijohn4 i7 3 9 and5 i8 90 i john 5 16 i 8 and 10 91 luke 23 the conferences of cassian 253 his ears so as not to hear the weak shall himself cry and there shall be none to hear him 3 92 n germanus you have spoken with power and grandeur about the perfect charity of god but we are troubled for this reason while you were so much exalting charity you said that the fear of god and the hope of eternal reward were imperfect but the prophet seems to have disagreed with you tear the lord all ye his saints for they that fear him lack nothing 9 again he avowed that in acting righteously his motive was the vision of the reward from god c i have inclined my heart to do thy righteous acts always for the reward and st paul said c by faith moses when he was grown up denied himself to be the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to be afflicted with the people of god than to have the pleasure of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasure of the egyptians for he looked unto the reward 93 then how can we believe fear and hope to be imperfect david gloried that he did righteous deeds with an eye on the reward moses refused to become a member of a royal family out of hope for future reward and preferred suffering to the treasures of egypt 12 chaeremon god's scriptures call us who have free will to the different rungs in the ladder of perfection but call one in one way another in another according to the mental condition of each person the perfection of each person is not the same the crown of each head is not of the same uniform pattern not everyone possesses the same power or earnestness of will god's word has offered different measures of perfection to different kinds of people this is obvious from the variety of beatitudes in the gospel the people whose is the kingdom of heaven are called blessed and the people who shall inherit the earth are called blessed the people who shall be comforted are called blessed and so are those whose hunger after righteousness has been filled yet we believe that there is a vast difference between living in the kingdom of heaven and possessing as much as you like on earth a vast difference between receiving comfort and being filled with righteousness a vast difference between the merciful who shall obtain mercy and the pure in heart who shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the glorious vision of god for there is one glory of the sun and another of the moon 92 gal 6 2 cor 13 14 7 prov 12 10 lxx 13 17 lxx 21 13 lxx 93 ps 34 9 119 112 hcb ii 124 6 254 western asceticism and another glory of the stars for star differeth from star in glory so also is the resurrection from the dead 9 it is in accord with this rule that god's scripture praises those who fear him blessed are all they that fear the lord and it even promises them a beatitude full and entire yet scripture also says there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear for fear hath torment but he that feareth is not yet made perfect in love again on the one side scripture says that it is a grand thing to serve the lord and serve the lord in fear and c lt is a great thing for thee to be called my servant and blessed is that ser vant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing yet on the other side the lord said to the apostles i no longer call you servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i call you friends for all things whatsoever i have heard from my father i have made known unto you and c ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you 94 you see how there are different rungs in the ladder of per fection and that the lord calls us upward from what is high to what is higher you can be perfect in the fear of god then you go as it is written from strength to strength from one kind of perfection to another kind of perfection from fear to hope in this new stage you are called onward to a still higher blessedness charity he who was a faithful and wise servant becomes a friend and an adopted son in this light you must understand what i said i do not assert that the continual contemplation of eternal punishment or of the blessed reward promised to the saints is worthless i assert that they are useful and introduce their possessors to the begin ning of the life of bliss and yet that charity with its fuller confidence and joy will take them out of servile fear or hope of payment to love god and be adopted as his sons so to say from being perfect to being more perfect our saviour said 6 in my father's house are many man sions and although everything shines which is in the sky the sun and the moon and the morning star and the rest do not all shine with the same light st paul puts charity not only above fear and hope but above every other sort of gift of god however great and wonderful and sets out to show us a more excellent way when he had finished his catalogue of god's gifts and wanted to describe them more in detail he first wrote and yet i show unto you a still more excellent way though i 94j cor 15 41 2 ps 8 x i john 4 18 ps a:n isa 49 6 ucx matt 24 46 john 15 14 15 the conferences of cassian 255 speak with the tongues of men and of angels and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all know ledge and though i have all faith so that i can remove moun tains and though i give all my goods to feed the poor and give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing 3 you see that there is nothing more precious more perfect more sublime more lasting than charity whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away but charity shall never fail without it the most trans cendent and excellent kinds of spiritual gift even the glory of martyrdom itself is made nothing 13 the man who is rooted in this perfect charity must climb one more step to a higher fear this fear arises not from terror of punishment or greed for a reward but from love a son fears a generous father brother fears brother friend fears friend husband fears wife fears not blows nor abuse but the least offence against the loving relationship in deed and word he acts with a reverence in fear that the love of the other towards himself may begin to grow cooler one of the prophets has finely described the grandeur of this kind of fear c wisdom and knowledge are the riches of salvation the fear of the lord is its treasure he could not have expressed more clearly the value of this fear than by saying that the riches of our salvation which are true wisdom and knowledge of god cannot be preserved without it the psalmist invited saints not sinners to this fear of the lord tear the lord all his saints for they that fear him lack nothing the man who fears the lord like this will lack nothing for his perfection st john was obviously talking about fear of punishment when he wrote e he that feareth is not made perfect in love be cause fear hath punishment there is a lot of difference then between the fear which lacks nothing which is the treasure of wisdom and knowledge and the imperfect fear which is called c the beginning of wisdom which carries its own punishment with it and so is expelled from the hearts of the truly charitable for there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear if fear is the beginning of wisdom what will the end of wisdom be but in christ's charity a charity which includes the fear of true love and so is called the treasure of wisdom and know ledge thus there are two fears a beginners fear the fear of men who are still slaves and afraid the servant shall fear his lord 256 western asceticism and the gospel text i no longer call you servants for the ser vant knoweth not what his lord doeth and therefore he said the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the son abideth for ever 5 he grants us to pass from fear of punishment to the fullest liberty of charity and the confidence of the friends and sons of god st paul who had himself been brought by the lord's love out of servile fear laid aside the lower and affirmed that the lord had enriched him with a higher good c god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind and st paul thus addressed men who truly loved their heavenly father and whom god had already adopted and transformed from slaves into sons c you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have re ceived the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the other fear appears in the text where the prophet is des cribing the sevenfold gift of the spirit which according to the mystery of the incarnation full surely descended upon our lord's manhood and there shall rest upon him the spirit of the lord the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and strength the spirit of knowledge and of true godliness and lastly and emphatically the spirit of fear shall fill him 95 about this text you should first take care to observe that he does not say as of the others that c the spirit of fear shall rest upon him but shall fill him 9 the power of it is so abundant that if once it possesses a man in its strength it possesses his mind to the exclusion of all else linked with the charity which never fails it fills and permanently possesses the soul whom it has seized and cannot be lessened by the temptations of any this worldly happiness this is the perfect fear which is said to have filled the lord's humanity who came to redeem mankind and give them their example and pattern of goodness the true son of god who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth could not feel the servile fear of punishment 14 germanus now that you have finished your descrip tion of perfect charity i should like to ask a further question on the aim of chastity i am sure that the pinnacle of charity whereby we reach up to the image and likeness of god cannot exist without perfect chastity but we should like you to teach us whether chastity so stable that no allurement ever interrupts the heart's integrity is a possibility in this life 15 chaeremon it is a mark of holiness to be always learn ss mai i 6 lxx john 15 15 and 8 35 ii tim 1 7 rom 8 15 isa 11 2 the conferences of cassian 257 ing or teaching how to cleave to the lord day and night as the psalmist said we ought to meditate on him all our lives and thereby nourish the mind in its hunger and thirst after righteous ness a hunger and thirst which can never be satisfied but the saviour in his loving kindness wishes us to look after our servant the body and we ought to look after its needs so that it may not grow too tired the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak 96 it is time to eat a little and afterwards we shall be able to discuss your enquiry more attentively chaeremon went on in his second conference to the theme of chastity as a possible state of life distinguished from and higher than continence but only possible by god's grace and long patience in the third conference of chaeremon conference 13 cassian took the opportunity since he had been led to the subject of grace to write a tract against st augustine's views on predestination and irresistible grace he was ever anxious to preserve the sense of moral responsibility and initiative and effort which he feared that the augustinian doctrines must undermine conference 14 is the first conference of abba nesteros and on spiritual knowledge i.e the way to understand and interpret the scriptures and the moral qualities and religious insight necessary for rightly understanding them conference 15 the second conference of abba nesteros on miraculous gifts i after evening service we sat down as usual on the mats ready to listen to the talk which he had promised for some little time we kept a respectful silence and he it was who spoke first in the course of our previous talk we have come naturally to the subject of spiritual gifts the traditions of the elders teach that there are three reasons for these gifts one is for purposes of healing a grace which sometimes accompanies holy and chosen men because of their sanctity we read that the apostles and many of the saints did signs and wonders by the lord's authority c heal the sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers cast out devils freely ye have received freely give 97 96 ps 1 2 matt 15 32 and 126 41 9 7 matt 10 8 258 western asceticism the second reason is to edify the church to build up the faith of the people who bring their sick or who are themselves in need of healing here the power of healing proceeds even from men who are sinners unworthy of it the saviour says in the gospel many shall say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many mighty works and then i will confess to them i never knew you depart from me ye workers of iniquity but if the patients or those who bring them lack faith this prevents the men who possess the gift of healing from exercising it so the evangelist luke wrote jesus could not there do any mighty work because of their unbelief and the lord himself said many lepers were in israel in the days of elisha the prophet and none of them was cleansed but naaman the syrian 98 the third is healing worked by the deceitful power of demons it happens when a man who is obviously a sinner is regarded as a saint and friend of god because he works miracles others are led to copy his sins scandal arises and religion is defamed or sometimes the demons do it to lift into pride the man who be lieves himself to possess the miraculous gift and so prepare him for a more disastrous fall they pretend that they are being burnt up and driven out from the bodies where they were dwelling through the holiness of people whom truly they know to be unholy 2 then we ought not to admire people who possess these powers on account of these powers we should see whether they are morally reformed god's grace gives this to a man not for miscellaneous reasons like the faith of someone else but in proportion to his own earnestness this is the knowledge of true goodness which st paul calls charity and is more excellent than all the tongues of men and of angels the faith which moves mountains all knowledge the sacrifice of one's property s 8 matt 7 22 3 mark 6 5 6 matt 13 58 luke 4 27 99 deuteronomy refers to this if there rise up in the midst of thee a prophet or one who says that he has seen a dream and declare a sign and wonder and that which he hath spoken cometh to pass and he say to thee let us go and follow after other gods whom thou knowcst not and let us serve them thou shalt not hear the words of that prophet or of that dreamer for the lord thy god is tempting thee that li may appear whether thou lovest him or not with all thy heart and with all thy soul and in the gospel we read there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall give great signs and wonders so that if it were pos sible even the elect should be led astray deut 13 1 3 matt 24 24 the conferences of cassian 259 even than the ultimate glory of martyrdom first he gave a list of the different sorts of spiritual gifts e to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge to another faith to another the gift of healing to another the working of miracles and the rest and then he laconically puts charity above them all and yet show i unto you a more excel lent way the text is plain the summit of perfection and blessedness consists not in working miracles but in pure charity all else will pass away charity will abide that is why i never saw my teachers set any store by miracles even when they possessed this particular grace of the holy spirit they would never use it except in some extreme and compelling necessity 3 i remember how abba macarius who was the first to live alone in the desert of scete raised a dead man to life it hap pened like this a heretic a disciple of eunomius was trying to pervert the catholic faith by skilful argument and had succeeded in cap turing a good number of followers disturbed by these losses catholic men asked blessed macarius to come and save the simple faith of all egypt from this shipwreck wheft macarius came the heretic used subtle syllogisms to attack him and tried to drag him into the prickly jungle of aristotle about whom macarius knew nothing but macarius replied to his lengthy arguments by a short text of st paul the kingdom of god is not in word but in power 1 let us go to the cemetery and invoke the name of the lord upon the first corpse we find let us prove our faith by our works as the scripture says let the lord's testimony decide upon the orthodox faith and not a futile debate this is the judgement which is infallible the heretic was very embarrassed at hearing this in the middle of the crowd but for the moment he pretended to agree and promised to appear there next day when the next day came all the people assembled expecting a great spectacle but the heretic stricken by the consciousness of his infidelity fled away and escaped from egypt macarius and the people waited for him until 3 o'clock but seeing that he had refused the contest macarius gathered the people whose faith had been perverted and led them to the cemetery the river nile overflows and covers the whole country for no small part of the year turning it into what looks like a sea and making boats the only means of communication hence the 1 1 cor 4 20 260 western asceticism egyptians have the custom of embalming the dead and then burying them in tombs lifted above ground level the soil is too damp to make normal interment possible if you bury a body in it the successive floods bring it to the surface macarius stood by a very old corpse and said man tell me this if that damnable heretic had come here with me and i had invoked in his presence the name of christ my god would you have risen from the dead in front of these people who were almost led away by his false teaching 5 the man rose and said that he would then abba macarius asked him what he had been during his life when he lived and whether he had known christ's name he said that he lived under the ancient kings of egypt and had not in those days heard of christ's name so abba macarius replied sleep in peace with the rest of your fellows waiting for christ to raise you at the last perhaps this power of grace in macarius would always have remained hidden unless he had been driven to work the miracle by the danger into which the province was running and by his true love for christ he did it not for the sake of ostentation but was forced to do it for the love of christ and the good of the people this is what elijah did as we read in the book of kings when he called down fire from heaven upon the sacrifice ready on the pyre so as to free his people's faith from being en dangered by the wonder working of the false prophets 4 perhaps i should say a little of the deeds of abba abraham who was nicknamed the simple because of his innocence and the simplicity of his manners in eastertide he had gone from his hermitage into egypt with the aim of harvesting a woman besieged him weeping and praying for her baby who was al ready weak and half dead from lack of milk abraham gave her a cup of water signed with the sign of the cross and as soon as she drankit her dry breasts began marvellously to flow with milk 5 once when he went to a village a mocking crowd surrounded him and jeered at him they showed him a man who for many years had had a crippled knee and was forced to crawl and tempted him saying abba abraham give us a sign if you are a servant of god and restore this cripple to health or we shall believe that the name of christ whom you worship is powerless he at once invoked christ's name stooped down and pulled the man's withered foot out and at his touch the bent and withered knee was straightened and he happily walked away on his legs which he had forgotten how to use through so many years of weakness the conferences of cassian 26l 6 these men felt no pride in their power to do miracles of this sort they said that the miracles were wrought by them not because they were good men but because the lord was merci ful they rejected the admiration which comes from popular regard for miracles using the words of the apostle men and brothers why marvel ye at this or why look ye on us as though by our own power or holiness we had caused this man to walk 9 they thought that a man should never be cried up for the wonderful gifts of god but only if he was a good man doing good intentionally men of corrupted minds heretics cast out devils and work miracles in the name of the lord it is true that when the apostles complained master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbade him because he followeth not with us 5 christ at the time replied torbid him not for he that is not against you is for you but when in the judgement these wonder workers say lord lord have we not in thy name prophesied and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many mighty works christ proclaimed that he would answer e l never knew you depart from me ye workers of iniquity he himself warns people to whom he gives this power of miracles because of their holiness that they are not to be proud of it c rejoice not because the devils are subject to you but rejoice rather because your names are written in heaven 2 7 he who is the author of all miracles and wonder working called his true and chosen disciples to hear his teaching and showed them what they were most particularly to learn come and learn of me not to cast out devils by heaven's power not to heal lepers not to raise the dead though i do these things by some of my servants man cannot ascribe to himself the praise due to god cannot snatch for himself any part of the glory due to god alone man is but the agent the minister instead he said learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart 3 every one can learn this lesson and obey it wonders and powers are not always necessary for some are harmful and are not granted to everyone humility then is the queen of all the virtues she is the stable foundation of the house of heaven she is the peculiar and marvellous gift of the saviour the only person who can without risk of pride work the miracles which christ wrought is the man who follows our gentle lord not in working miracles 2 acts 3 12 luke 9 49 5o matt 7 22 3 luke 10 ao 3 matt 11 28 9 western asceticism but in patience and humility he whose motive is ostentation in commanding unclean spirits or healing the sick or showing some wonderful sign to the people is a stranger to christ though he invokes christ's name for he is proud and follows not his master's humility when the lord was returning to his father he wrote so to say his will and left it to his disciples thus a new command ment give i unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you so do ye also love one another 3 and immediately after wards by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love to one another he did not say if ye do signs and miracles like me but if ye love one another surely none but the humble and the meek can obey this commandment that is why our elders never counted as true monks men who boasted of their exorcising powers and spread the grace which they possessed or alleged they possessed in front of crowds of admirers and the ostentation was futile he who trusteth in lies feedeth the winds and the same runneth after birds that fly away we find their retribution in the book of proverbs whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is as easy to see as the wind and the clouds and the rain 4 so if we are present when someone works a miracle we are not to admire him because of the act but only for his moral life we are not to ask whether the devils are subject to him but whether he possesses the charity which st paul described 8 it is a bigger miracle to eject passion from your own body than it is to eject an evil spirit from another's body it is a bigger miracle to be patient and refrain from anger than it is to control the demons which fly through the air it is better to rid your own heart of the melancholy which corrodes it than it is to rid someone else of bodily disease the power which heals your own soul is finer and loftier than the power which heals another's body the soul is more important than the body its salvation more urgent the more precious the material the more destructive is the fall 9 of bodily healing the lord said to his apostles rejoice not that the devils are subject to you 5 they did it not in their own strength but in the power of his name which they invoked so they are warned against the presumption of claiming any glory on this score for god did it by his power they arc warned to claim glory on the ground of the inner purity of life and 4 john 13 34 5 frov 10 4 prov 25 14 5 luke 10 20 the conferences of cassian 263 heart for thereby it was granted that their names should be written in heaven 10 i will prove what i have said by ancient evidence and god's oracles here are the very words of the blessed paph nutius when giving his opinion about admiration of miracles and the grace of purity words which he learnt from the mouth of an angel in his old age paphnutius still kept a strictly discip lined rule of life he believed that he was absolutely immune from temptations to his chastity for he knew that in the long struggles with demons he had always emerged the victor one day some monks were visiting him and while he was sreparing for them the lentil porridge which they call athera a ame darted out and burnt his hand while it was itx the oven it easily happens but paphnutius was deeply depressed and began to consider silently in his mind thus why is there not peace between me and the fire the fiercer fighting with the demons has ceased yet this little ephemeral fire has attacked me what of the eternal fire on the dreadful day of judgement which searches out the good and the bad will it pass me over his mind was still chasing these melancholy thoughts when sleep suddenly came over him and in his sleep an angel of the lord came and said why are you sad paphnutius are you sad that you are not yet at peace with the fire from the oven while you have not fully purified the lusts of your body so long as the roots of that lust dwell within you they will not let the material fire be at peace with you you will not feel it at peace with you unless you make the following experiment to prove that all lust is extinct go lay hold upon a fair maiden atxd if your heart remains tranquil and your bodily senses serene this fire in the oven will be as harmless and gentle to you as it was to the three children in the burning fiery furnace at babylon old paphnutius was struck by the vision and did not risk the experiment which god had suggested he guessed that his chastity might not stand the test instead he examined his conscience and investigated the purity of his heart e lt is not then surprising he said that i feel the fire to be still hostile to me though i have conquered unclean devils and believe the fire's onslaught to be far more trivial than those of the demons it is a greater gift to kill lust within than to drive the devils without by the lord's high power and invocation of his name so abba nesteros ended his account of the true working of the miraculous gifts of god moved by his teaching we were 264 western asceticism eager to hear the elder joseph whose cell was some six miles away and abba nesteros conducted us thither the two conferences of joseph were delivered upon friend ship and on making promises the second because cassian or his friends were worried by his breaking of his word to the com munity at bethlehem of an early return these two conferences ended the second division of cassian's work but he was also sending seven other conferences to the monks living in the stoechades islands and these are at present conferences 18 24 a group miscellaneous in character here are translated the eighteenth on the three kinds of monks and the nineteenth on the aims of the coenobite and hermit conference 18 conference of abba piamun on the three sorts of monks i after we had visited and talked with those three old men whose conferences i have tried to describe at the request of our brother eucherius germanus and i were still eager to visit the remoter parts of egypt where most of the holy men were living we came to diolcos a village near one of the seven mouths of the nile it was off our route but we wanted to see the ascetics there the moment we heard of a celebrated monastery founded by the old fathers we started out thither not knowing what we should find like money making mer chants risking the journey but hoping for greater profits at diolcos we wandered round for a long time from cell to cell we were like travellers surveying a high range of moun tains who in the end found the highest abba piamun towering over the others in his sanctity the oldest of the ascetics there and their priest the others directed us to him because they looked towards him as navigators guide their course by a lighthouse like the city set on the hill in the gospel shining its light upon the country piamun enlightened us god's grace testified to his goodness for in our presence he worked miracles but them i must omit if i am to keep to the proper plan of this book i did not promise to write about god's miracles but about the discipline and rules of the holy men as far as i can remember them my intention is to show people how to lead the good life not to give the reader idle stories which are useless for reform ing his character the conferences of cassian 265 when piamun understood that we were strangers he wel comed us warmly and hospitably he first asked where we had come from and why we had come and when he heard that we had come to egypt from a community in syria with the aim of finding the way of perfection he began to talk 2 my sons anyone who wants to be skilful at an art will fail unless he takes the utmost pains to study the system and observe the rules of the best masters it is silly to think you can become like people whose industry you are refusing to imitate simply by wishing to become like them i have met people who have come here from your country simply to travel round the monasteries without any intention of starting to keep the rules of the monks or of retiring into cells and putting into practice what they have seen or heard they retained their native character and manners and some allege that they really changed their country not with any purpose of spiritual profit but simply be cause they were poor and in want in their own country they were so obstinate that they could learn nothing and could not even stay any length of time here and if they came here and yet changed nothing not fasting nor psalmody nor clothes we naturally thought their only reason for coming here was to find food 3 i believe that you have come here because god has drawn you to follow our way to knowledge and if so you must altogether abandon the rules which you were taught in syria during the early days of your vocation and humbly follow whatever you see our elders do or teach you must not be troubled or stop imitating us because at the moment you do not see the reason of something if men are in the right sense simple enough to think well of everything if they are careful to copy whatever the elders have taught or practised and not to argue about it then through experience they come to know the reason why the man who learns by argument will never find the true reason for the enemy seeing him trust to his own judgement rather than that of the fathers easily pushes him into thinking valuable and saving practices to be harmful or futile the enemy can cleverly play on his presumption and so he clings obstinately to his unreasonable opinions and decides that only to be holy which his stubborn judgement regards as right 4 first you should know how our way of life arose and who founded it a man can only be trained effectively in some art and be led to practise it earnestly when he recognizes the eminence of its authors 266 western asceticism in egypt there are three kinds of monks two are excellent the third is half hearted and at all costs to be avoided the first kind is the coenobites these are monks living in a community under the government of a single elder most of the egyptian monks are coenobites the second kind is the hermits these are men who have first been trained in communities to the life of virtue and have then chosen to live a completely hidden and solitary life this is the life which i wish to follow the third and culpable kind is the sarabaites i shall talk about each of these three kinds in turn first as i said you ought to know the founders of each kind from this knowledge alone may arise a dislike of the sort which is to be shunned and a desire for the sort which is to be followed each way will carry the man who follows it to the destination which its founder reached 5 the system of the coenobites arose at the time when the apostles were preaching the crowd of believers in jerusalem was of this sort as it is described in the acts of the apostles the multitude of believers was of one heart and one soul neither said any of them that any of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common they sold their possessions and property and divided them to all as any man had need and tor neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as possessed fields or houses sold them and brought the price of the things that they sold and laid them before the apostles feet and distribution was made to every man as he had need the whole church i assert lived then as the coenobites live now so few that it is difficult to find them but after the death of the apostles crowds of strangers and men of different races flowed into the church the apostles had judged that since they were new converts and had grown accustomed to pagan habits nothing more should be asked of them than that they should abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from fornication and from things strangled and from blood 6 their faith was cooler than the faith of the first christians and so the faith of the whole christian body began to grow cold the liberty conceded to the gentiles because they were neophytes and therefore weak in faith began little by little to infect the whole church at jerusalem and diminish its per s acts 4 32 5 2 45 15 29 the conferences of cassian 267 feet life and as day by day the number of converts at home and abroad grew and the primitive christians lost their fervour the leaders of the church as well as the new converts began to lose something of their strict discipline there were some who thought they might lawfully do what was allowed to the gentiles and follow christ though they kept all their property and money and so the christians who were still fervent as the christians of apostolic days and remembered the original and perfect way of life left their cities and the company of those who thought they could live negligently and comfortably in god's church and dwelt in places outside the cities or in even more remote haunts they began to keep privately and as individuals the rules which they remembered were given by the apostles to the whole church the coenobites discipline grew up from the disciples who separated themselves in order not to be infected by lax chris tians after a short time marked out from most of the faithful by their celibacy and their separation from their relatives and society they came to be known as monks or monazontes because they lived a disciplined life alone when they joined together they were known as coenobites and their cells and habitations were called coenobia this was the earliest kind of monk first in time and in the grace of god and for many years until the time of abba paul and antony it remained the only kind we still see the traces of it in strict coenobia 6 these coenobites men of perfect life were if i may say so a stem from which grew many flowers and fruit the hermits everyone knows the founders of this way whom i men tioned just now abba paul and antony their motive for choosing the solitary life was not cowardice nor intolerance of community living but a wish to advance further in the con templation of god though paul is said to have been driven into the desert to escape arrest during the persecution so this second way of perfection sprang out of the first its followers are called anchorites that is withdrawers they have not re mained satisfied with defeating the attacks which the devils secretly plan in human society but have been ready to meet them in open war that is why they have penetrated courage ously into the fastnesses of the desert like john the baptist who remained in the desert all his life or elijah and elisha and the others whom st paul mentioned they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being in want distressed afflicted of 268 western asceticism whom the world was not worthy wandering in deserts in mountains and caves of the earth 7 7 while the christian religion was happy in these two ways for monks though by degrees the system of the hermits also began to deteriorate there appeared or rather reappeared a faithless variety of monk the kind which was represented by ananias and sapphira at the beginning of the church's history and which the apostle peter had so severely forbidden the apostle did not allow the inventors of this sinful way to be res tored after repentance and satisfaction but destroyed them as you would a noxious weed as long as the memory of peter's severity remained impressed upon the faithful this kind of monk was regarded as hateful by everyone and no one tried that way of ise but when the memory of the dread sentence on ananias and sapphira had faded gradually there appeared the sarabaites this is an egyptian word meaning persons who have deserted their communities and live each to himself they are descended from ananias and sapphira they do not follow the perfect way they prefer to pretend to follow it no doubt they want to be rivals of and to gain the kind of credit given to people who choose christ's utter poverty above all the riches of the world they pursue true goodness feebly they must needs become monks in order to gain the repute of monks but they make no effort to follow their discipline disregard the rules of the com munities are outside all control from the elders fail to use the elders traditions to conquer their self will they make a public profession of renunciation and acquire the credit of the title 7 the lord's words to job refer to them figuratively but who hath sent out the wild ass free and who hath loosed his bands to them i have given the wilderness for a house and a barren land for his dwelling he scorneth the multitude of the city and heareth not the cry of the tax collector he looketh round about the mountains of his pasture and seeketh for every green thing so in the psalms let now the redeemed of the lord speak those whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy they wandered in a wilderness in a place without water they found not the way of an inhabited city they were hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them and they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distress so jeremiah blessed is the man that hath borne the yoke from his youth he shall sit solitary and keep silent because he hath taken it up upon himself it is the hermits who with love and in earnest sing the words of the psalmist i am become like a pelican in the wilderness i watched and am become like a sparrow alone upon the house top heb 11 37 8 job 39 5 8 lxx ps 107 2 6 lam 3 a7 8 ps 102 7 8 the conferences of cassian 269 and then go on living in their homes just as before carrying on the same work or they build cells for themselves call them monasteries and live in them as they please they disobey the gospel commands not to be anxious about our daily bread or our everyday affairs it is only possible to obey these commands if you abandon all your property and so subject yourself to the superiors of a community that you cannot say you are your own master in anything shirking the austere rule of a community living two or three together in a cell under no direction aiming above all else at having freedom from the elders of going where they like and of satisfying whatever passion they hke they are more busied about the necessities of life day and night than are coenobites but their intentions and faith are quite different from those of coenobites they toil not to offer their produce or earnings to the steward of the community but to save money for themselves see what a gulf lies between them the coenobite takes no thought for the morrow and offers god the most acceptable fruits of his labour the sarabaite is faithlessly anxious not only about the morrow but about years ahead he believes god false or impotent because he has promised to give sufficient food and clothing and yet cannot or will not the coenobite prayerfully seeks absolute poverty for ever the sarabaite seeks wealth the coenobite struggles to fulfil more than the regular task in his daily work so that if the monastery has more than it needs the extra money may be given away by the abbot in prisons or in the guestchamber or in the infirmary or to the poor the sarabaite works so that whatever is extra above his daily but greedy needs may be spent extravagantly or saved for his future use even granting that their ill gotten earnings are sometimes dis tributed in better ways than these it is still true that they are not aspiring after goodness the coenobite in his humility and obedience accounts to the monastery daily for what he has earned and surrenders it with the same self sacrifice with which he originally devoted himself to poverty he re dedicates him self daily to a life of renunciation the sarabaite every day rushes headlong into sin by being complacent about his gener osity to the poor the coenobite patient under his discipline continuing steadfastly in his chosen way never to obey self will becomes crucified daily to the world a martyr while he is still on earth the sarabaite is dragged down to hell by his half heartedness in egypt there are almost equal numbers of coenobites and 270 western asceticism sarabaites but in other provinces where the needs of the catholic faith have forced me to travel i have found this third kind the sarabaites to be abundant and almost the only sort of monk in the time of lucius who was an arian bishop during the reign of valens i ministered to the brethren from egypt and the thebaid who had been exiled to the mines of pontus and armenia because they stood firm in their orthodoxy and on this journey i very occasionally found disciplined coenobites in a number of cities but i discovered that no one had even heard of the way of the hermits 8 there is also a fourth kind of monk which lately i have observed appearing among people who look and behave like hermits at first they are fervent and for a short time seek the true coenobite's life but they quickly grow lukewarm because they are too complacent to put aside their old sins will not bear the yoke of humility and patience for long disdain the control of the elders and therefore they look out for separate cells and want to live alone since no one will then trouble them they will be able to be reputed patient gentle and humble this half hearted scheme prevents anyone whom it infects from approaching the way of perfection so far from being eradicated sins strike deeper roots it is like a fatal poison in the stomach the more deep seated in the body the more it creeps onward and generates incurable disease out of reverence for the solitary no one dares to criticize his faults and so he has chosen rather to know nothing about his own faults than to get rid of them goodness is begotten not by forgetting about sin but by destroying it 9 germanus is there any difference between the coenobiurn and the monastery or are they two names for the same thing 10 piamun some people use the two words as synonyms but there is this much difference monastery means the spot the place where the monks live coenobium means not only where they live but how they live the kind of rule they adopt and monastery can be used to mean a hermit's cell coenobium cannot be used except where a number of brothers are dwelling together in unity monastery is also used to describe the groups of sarabaites 11 i see that you have learnt the principles of this way of life from the best kind of monks you are aiming at the heights of the hermit's way after being rightly trained in the coenobium i am sure that you there learnt humility and patience and arc the conferences of cassian 27 still following them and truly following them from the heart not merely putting on an appearance by humble sounding words and humble seeming postures once abba sarapion finely mocked this sham humility a man arrived at his cell making a great show of lowliness in his dress and speech sarapion as is usual asked him to offer a collect the visitor refused and said that he was guilty of such crimes that he did not deserve even to breathe the same air refusing the mat he sat on the ground still less would he allow sarapion to wash his feet after supper it is usual to have a religious conference so sarapion began with kindness and gentleness to warn him against being an idle and haphazard wanderer especially as he was young and strong he told him that he ought to settle in a cell subject himself to the rules of the elders and maintain himself by his own work instead of living on the hospitality of others since st paul was working for the spread of the gospel he might reasonably have lived on others yet he preferred to work day and night to get daily bread for himself and those who were ministering to him and could not work themselves 8 at this speech the visitor fell into grief and vexation and could not keep the bitterness of his heart out of his face so sarapion said e my son you have accused yourself of bearing the burden of crime and you were not afraid to lower your reputation by confessing wicked sins how is it then that i see you moved with indignation so that you cannot even pretend to keep a serene countenance at my simple little piece of advice there was nothing abusive in what i said its motives were edification and friendship is it possible that in humiliating yourself you were hoping to hear me say the righteous man is his own accuser when he begins to speak 9 you must keep true humility of heart and true humility comes not from affectation of posture or speech but from an interior humbling of the mind humility and patience will shine out not when a man accuses himself of crimes which no one will believe but when he bears arrogant and unjust abuse with a gentle peace ableness 12 germanus we should like to know how to get and keep that tranquillity if we are told to be silent it is easy to say nothing but we sometimes lose interior gentleness of heart even s gf ii thess 3 8 acts 20 34 prov 18 17 lxx for this story cf apophthegmato serapion 6.4 verba seniorum viii 9 and these translations p 98 272 western asceticism when we succeed in being silent so i think that no one can be stable in gentleness unless he is living alone in a hermit's cell 13 piamun the only source of true patience and tranquil lity is deep humility of heart if it flows from this source you do not need the solitary's cell to gain it if it is nourished intern al by its mother and guardian humility it needs no external support but if criticism annoys us it is certain that humility has no firm foundation for even a mild breeze can ruinously shake our house the patience which is admirable does not consist in a peace of mind which is retained because it is never assailed it consists in the peace which remains amid tempestuous tempta tions to lose it troubles which the world thinks will overthrow it are its strengthening blows which the world thinks will blunt it are its sharpening everyone knows that patience is derived from passion and endurance and therefore that you cannot call anyone patient unless he endures indignities without annoyance so solomon rightly praised the patient man better is the patient man than the strong and he who restrains his anger more than he that taketh a city and c a long suffering man is mighty in prudence but a faint hearted man is very foolish 9 10 therefore if a wronged man flares up in anger the wrongful abuse should not be thought the cause of his sin but the manifestation of a hidden weakness our lord and saviour taught a parable about two houses one founded on a rock and the other on sand on both houses fell the rain and the floods and the storms but the one built on the rock sustained the violence unharmed the one built on shifting sand straightway collapsed it is obvious that it did not collapse because the rains and the floods beat upon it but be cause it had been built foolishly on sand the saint does not differ from the sinner in not being tempted so strongly the saint is not conquered by a great onslaught the sinner falls to a trivial temptation as i said we should not praise the courage of a man who had won a fight without opposition no conflict with an enemy no victory blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he has been proved he shall receive the crown of life which god hath promised to them that love him st paul said that strength is made perfect not in ease and comfort but in weakness tor behold i have made thee this day a fortified 10 prov 16 32 lxx 14 29 lxx the conferences of cassian 273 city and a pillar of iron and a wall of brass over all the land to the kings of judah and to the princes thereof and to the priests thereof and to the people of the land and they shall fight against thee and shall not prevail for i am with thee saith the lord to deliver thee n 14 i want to give you two examples of true patience a religious woman was once so ardent in pursuing patience that she sought out temptation instead of avoiding it she wanted to test herself and teach herself not to yield she was of aristocratic ancestry and lived at alexandria serving the lord faithfully in the house left to her by her parents she went to bishop athanasius of blessed memory and asked him to allow her to support one of the widows at present being maintained by the church's treasury her actual words were give me one of the sisters to look after the bishop praised her intention and saw that she was generous in her almsgiving so he ordered that one of the widows should be selected who was outstanding in integrity and seriousness and self discipline otherwise if the recipient of the charity were a sinner or wicked woman he was afraid the donor's generosity would be diminished or that in disgust she might even take some harm to her own faith taking the widow home the lady rendered her every service she soon discovered her modesty and gentleness and found that she was given thanks for everything which she did so after a few days she returned to bishop athanasius and said i asked you to give me someone to refresh someone whom i could try to please by my services athanasius did not yet understand what she wanted and thought that the head of his tieasury must have neglected to obey his command enquiring with some heat the cause of the delay he discovered that she had been given the most honourable widow on the church's list so he gave secret orders that she should be given the worst of the widows the one who bawled and brawled and drank and gossiped more than any other widow guilty of these vices it was all too easy to find the woman the lady received her be gan to keep her at home serve her as carefully as she had served die first now the only thanks she got was reviling and wrong doing and cursing the woman complained continually that she had been asked from the bishop with no intention of doing her good but solely with the object of torturing and scorning her she said that instead of passing from labour to rest she had passed from rest to labour her wanton abuse culminated in n james i 12 ii cor 12 g jer i 18 19 274 western asceticism blows but the lady meekly redoubled her efforts to serve her she learnt to overcome the harridan by obeying her quietly and to soften her abusive rage by humanity and gentleness by these exercises she was strengthened and obtained the true patience for which she was looking and she went to bishop athanasius and thanked him for the good his selection had done to her she said that he had at last given her what she wanted a most wonderful teacher of patience whose constant abuse like the oil with which a man smears himself when about to wrestle had trained her patience to be perfect c at last you have given me someone to look after for the first rather honoured and refreshed me by her services it is enough that this story should be told about a member of the female sex to edify us and even confound us we cannot keep our patience if we shut ourselves up in cells as wild boasts retire to their lairs 15 here is another example one of abba paphnutius paphnutius lived a strict life in the fastnesses of the celebrated desert of scete where he is now presbyter the other hermits called him the buffalo because he seemed to have a kind of innate love of solitude even as a youth he was eminent in goodness and grace the chief ascetics of that time marvelled at his seriousness and stability of purpose and in spite of his ago elected him into the number of the elders on the ground of his character but one of the monks like the patriarch joseph's brothers was inflamed by jealousy against him wanting to spoil the reputa tion of paphnutius he hit on a devilish plot he seized the moment on sunday when paphnutius was away from his cell at church he stole into the cell and there hid his own book among the plaits which paphnutius was in the habit of weaving from palm leaves confident in his plan he went to church like a man with a clear conscience at the end of the service ho lodged a public complaint to the holy isidore who was paphnutius predecessor as priest of this hermit brotherhood alleging that his book had been stolen from his cell the com plaint disturbed the brothers and above all their priest because they knew not what to suspect or what to decide and wore extremely astonished inasmuch as no one remembered a similar crime being perpetrated in that desert before and it has never happened since the plaintiff then urged that they should ail be confined to the church while searchers were chosen to examine every hermit's cell the priest entrusted the task to three of the the conferences of csassian elders they ransacked the bedding in each cell and at last found the book where the plotter had hidden it in paphnutius cell among the plaits the searchers immediately carried it back to church and displayed it the conscience of paphnutius was perfectly clear yet he offered to make satisfaction like a man who admits he is a thief asked and prayed to be put in the penitents seat in his shame and modesty he was afraid that if he tried to plead not guilty he would merely be believed to be a liar as well as a thief since everyone accepted the evidence he straightway left the church his mind not really cast down but trusting in god's judgement he poured out prayer and lamentations trebled his fasting and was seen by everyone to be prostrating himself in humility for nearly a fortnight he thus bruised his flesh and spirit and then on saturday and sunday came early in the morning to church not to receive holy communion but to lie prone in the church porch and beg for pardon then god who knows all secrets did not allow him to be further buffeted by providence nor further slandered by his fellows the wicked and guilty monk who had stolen his own property and had skilfully ruined the reputation of another had perpetrated his crime unseen but the devil who had egged him on caused it after all to be known the monk seized by some terrible demon blabbed about his whole plan and be traycd himself for a long time ho was so troubled by an un clean spirit that he could not even be cleansed by the prayers of the holy men in scetc who possessed the miraculous gift of exorcising demons not even the special grace of the priest isidore could expel this savage spirit though isidore was richly endowed by the lord with this power so that he could sometimes heal the possessed even at a distance christ was reserving this glory for the young paphnutius and thus the sinner was healed by the prayers of him against whom he had sinned and the name whose reputation he had tried to blast was the name which brought him pardon and relief from his suffering paphnutius in early days already showed the signs of his future character already planned the way to the perfection which was to be matured as he grew in years and we too if we want to be as saintly as he was must lay the foundations of that saintiwess in the same way x6 i had two reasons for telling this story knowing that our temptations are less than his we shall seek better for 276 western asceticism patience and tranquillity when we contemplate the rock like stability of paphnutius secondly we must resolve that we car never be safe from violent and devilish temptations if to proted our patience we put our trust in something outside us instead of inside us in the cell or the solitude or our association with holy men or anything else external in the gospel our lord said the kingdom of god is within you 12 and unless the same lord strengthen and protect our minds we are wrong h we think we can defeat the attacks of the enemies which fiy through the air merely by living with other men or a long wa off or inside walls to keep them out paphnutius had all these things yet the tempter found a way to attack him and was not repeued by a hermitage or a desert or holiness in the men oi that society he was not moved by an assault like that because he had fixed his heart's hope not on anything external but on the judge of all secrets and conversely did not the envious and guilty monk enjoy the protection of a solitary life and a distant cell and the company of st isidore his abba and priest and oi other holy men the satanic hurricane fell against a house built on sand and destroyed it then let us not seek our peace outside ourselves let us not think to cover our own impatience with someone else's patience as the kingdom of god is within you so a man's foes are they of his own household no one is more my enemy than my own heart the inmost indweller of my household if we arc careful we can prevent ourselves being injured by internal enemies if our own household is not assailing us there is the kingdom ot god and peace of mind look carefully and you will sec that i cannot be injured even by a villain if i am not at war against myself within my own heart if i am injured the sin is not due to the assault from outside it is due to my own lack of patience strong meat is healthy to the healthy but it kills a sick man it cannot hurt the eater unless his own illness makes the food harmful to him if ever a temptation like that of paphnutius arise among the brothers we need never be shaken from the path of peace need never allow an opening to the blasphemy and slander of worldly men need never be surprised that wicked men are to be found secretly among the holy societies thus world is a threshing floor which sifts us and tares destined for everlasting fire are mixed with the richest wheat remember that satan was chosen to be an angel judas an apostle the hcresiarch 12 luke 17 21 the conferences of cassian 277 nicolas a deacon it is no wonder that wicked men are to be found among the ranks of the saints some say that the heresiarch nicolas was not the man appointed to the diaconate by the apostles but they cannot deny that he was one of the disciples at a time when all the disciples were as perfect as the very few whom you now find with some difficulty in coenobia then let us forget the sad fall of the brother in that desert for get the horrible stain which he afterwards blotted out by his tears of penitence forget the ancient sin of envy which was made the worse because he was a religious let us remember the example of st paphnutius follow his humility with all our power a humility which was no sudden offspring of the hermitage but had first been acquired in human society and then perfected in the solitary life envy 13 you should know is a disease more difficult to cure than any other sin i would almost say that once a man is poisoned by it there is no antidote it is the plague of which the prophet spoke in an allegory behold i will send among you serpents basilisks against which there is no charm and they shall bite you 3 it is a good comparison between envy and the poisonous bite of the basilisk for by envy satan the source of all poison perished by envy he first slew himself and then the lord whom he envied he poured deadly poison into himself before he poured it into man by the envy of the devil death entered into the world they therefore who are on his side follow him 14 the first person to be corrupted by it allowed no antidote by repentance and so the envious put themselves outside the help of him who can cure the bite tormented not by the faults of the people they envy but by their prosperity they cannot admit the truth about others and are always on the watch for trivial and silly causes of offence these imaginary causes of offence cannot be overcome so long as the deadly virus is in them and they will not bring it to the surface the wise man has said if a serpent bite without hissing the charmer can do nothing it is only the silent bites which wise men cannot cure 13 this little conclusion on the sin of envy is given a separate chapter heading by some important manuscripts unlike the later list of seven deadly sins envy had found no place in the eight capital sins which cassian had treated in the institutes i have suspicions about its cassianic authorship on grounds of latin style and mode of handling the subject matter but these suspicions can claim no support in the manuscripts i jer 8 17 wisdom 2 124 278 western asceticism the disease is so incurable that it is made worse by treat ment the sore is inflamed by ointments solomon says envy endures nothing 15 the more progress another has made in humility or patience or generosity the more a man envies him and wants his ruin or death the eleven patriarchs could not be diverted from their envy by any submission on the part of their brother who had done no harm and scripture relates of them his brothers envied him because his father loved him and they could not speak peaceably unto him and in the end they were so jealous that they would listen to no entreaties plotted his death and were scarcely satisfied with the sin of selling him into slavery thus it is sure that envy is more destructive than the other faults more difficult to eradicate for it is kindled by the remedies which cure other sins for example the man who grieves for an injury done to him is cured by a generous com pensation though he was indignant at the wrong he can be placated if satisfaction is rendered humbly but what will you do for a man who is more offended the more kind and humble you are to him he is not irritated by his own greed which a bribe can heal nor by his desire to injure or love of revenge which gentleness could overcome he is irritated by another's happiness where shall we find a man who to satisfy another's envy will want to lose his own prosperity or wish a disaster to happen to him therefore in order not to lose the moral life within us the gait of us indwelt and quickened by the holy spirit by a single ite from the basilisk let us continually ask the help of god to whom nothing is impossible the other snake poisons are the carnal sins and though frail human nature easily falls into these it is as easily cleansed these other bites show marks on the body and however dangerous the swelling a skilful doctor can apply the healing remedy and the poison shall not reach the heart the wise guide to god's scriptures can apply the saving words and prevent the moral poison from killing the soul for eternity but envy is like the basilisk's poison it leaves no mark and penetrates to the very life of religion and faith before the person is aware that he is wounded the jealous man is not raising himself up against man but blaspheming against god for he is scandalized by nothing in his brother except his happi ness and is therefore attacking not man's guilt but the judge ments of god is eccl 10 11 lxx prov 27 4 lxx the conferences of cassian 279 this then is that e root of bitterness springing up it raises itself to heaven scorning god who gives his good to mankind no one should be worried because god threatens to send basilisks to bite men whose sins offend him it is certain that god cannot be the author of envy yet it is fair and worthy of god's justice that in bestowing good gifts on the humble and refusing them to the proud and the wicked he should smite and consume with envy those who deserve to be given over to a reprobate mind as st paul says this is what is meant by another text they have provoked me to jealousy by them that are no gods and i will provoke them to jealousy by them that are no nation 16 by this conference piamun stirred our desire to proceed further in our step from the primary school of the coenobium to the secondary grade of the hermitage it was under his guidance that germanus and i learnt the elements of the hermits way and began to acquire that knowledge which we afterwards extended in scete conference 19 conference of abba john on the aims of the coenobite and hermit i only a few days afterwards we went to the coenobium of abba paul in order to find further instruction there were more than two hundred resident monks but in honour of a feast the anniversary of the death of an earlier abbot of the monastery a vast crowd of monks from other coenobia was visiting the place i mention this meeting because i want shortly to describe the patience of one monk his imperturbable gentle ness in the presence of the whole crowd it is true that this conference is concerned with the words of abba john who left the desert and in humility became again a monk in a coeno bium yet i do not think it absurd to digress briefly if as i believe the story is edifying to earnest men when the crowd of monks was seated by parties of twelve in the huge open air court one of them was slow in bringing in a dish abba paul was walking round and carefully supervising the monks who were serving when he saw the delay he publicly gave the monk such a smack with his hand that the iheb is:i5 jer 8 17 rom i 28 deut 32 31 lxx 280 western asceticism sound was heard even by people sitting a long way off and with their backs turned the young man took the blow serenely said nothing gave no sign even of a murmur did not move his lips indeed did not change for a moment his modesty and serenity and colour of countenance a remarkable instance of patience we had lately come from our monastery in syria and had not been given such clear examples in how to be patient everyone and not only our two selves but the men familiar with these practices marvelled and even the most advanced learnt a particular lesson for it was not only that his father's correction did not disturb his patience it was the fact that although he was made a spectacle to such a great crowd his face showed not even a blush 17 2 we found in this coenobium a very old man named john i have thought it right to include what he said because he was a man of such humility humility though it is the mother of all foodness and the foundation of the whole house of the spirit is anished out of our own system so it is not surprising that we cannot climb to their moral level so far from being able to bear the discipline of the coenobium until old age we are scarcely ready to endure its yoke for two years and dare to run out to a liberty which does our soul harm and even for that short time we seem to submit to the elders not as the rule directs but as and how we like when we first saw old abba john in abba paups coenobium we were struck by his age and natural grace with downcast eyes we began to pray him to show us ignorant though we were why he had left the free and noble life of the hermit wherein he had won a fame beyond the fame of other men and had chosen to enter the coenobium and bear its yoke john replied that he had been unequal to the hermit's discipline and incapable of following that way to perfection he had therefore gone back to school to see if he could rightly keep the rules of the coenobium we refused to accept this humble reply and went on importuning at last he began to talk 3 you are surprised that i have left the hermit life it is not at all that i reject it or disapprove of it i regard it with the utmost veneration first i passed thirty years in a community 17 some medieval copyists struggled with interpolations either to defend abba paul's action as caroliruhensis 92 from reichenau or to make it clear that the action was bad and that gassian disapproved of it as parisinus nov acq 2170 the conferences of cassian 28l and then another twenty as a hermit and i am very glad of those twenty years at least half hearted hermits will not be able to accuse me of being slothful but though i found the purity of the life i also found that it was not unmixed with bodily anxieties it seemed better to return to the coenobium to aim at a lower target and hit it more easily and to avoid the risk of failing at the effort after a loftier way it is better to make a little promise and keep it than to make a big promise and break it if i put forward anything too freely or proudly please do not think it a form of boasting but out of charity and a care for your edification i think i ought to keep back nothing of the truth because you have importuned me so earnestly it is pos sible you will learn something if i lay aside my humility for a little and simply tell you what i am aiming at i hope you will not have to blame me on grounds of vanity and i hope i shall not have to blame myself for failing to tell you the truth 4 if there is anyone who delights in the desert loneliness and the separation from society if there is anyone who can say with jeremiah e l have not desired the day of man thou knowest 18 i confess that with god's help i was that man or was on the way to being that man i remember how often the lord granted me to be taken up into a kind of rapture so that i forgot my frail body and my mind lost its sense of material reality my eyes could not see and my ears could not hear my mind was full of meditation and contemplation upon god so that often in the evening i did not know i had eaten food and next morn ing had no idea whether i had broken my fast last night so on saturday i used to lay out food for seven days seven pairs of rolls of bread in a sort of basket so that i should know whether or not i had eaten by this method i could not forget when the week was ended and the services of the church had come round even if the raptures of which i spoke should interfere with this plan still the order of work from day to day prevented me making this mistake but i pass over the merits of the desert my subject is not the manifold good things to be found there but the respective aims of the coenobite and hermit i will briefly answer your request to explain why i chose to leave the desert and expound the high advantages of the common life which i preferred to all the fruits of the desert 5 at first there were few hermits in the desert we had r 17 16 282 western asceticism plenty of room and freedom at first we lived far in the fast nesses of the desert and were often taken up into heavenly visions in those days there was no crowd of visiting monks no need to undertake the distracting burden of hospitality in those days my spirit burned within me i hungered for the peace of solitude and the life filled with a bliss like the angels but soon a large number of monks began to live in the desert there was less room less freedom and i found that my ardour for the contemplation of god began to cool and my mind had to busy itself with all kinds of earthly matters i there fore determined to fulfil my ascetic purpose in the coenobium rather than become a half hearted solitary by constantly having to look after my bodily needs i no longer have freedom i am no longer taken up into ecstasies of spirit but i have this con solation that i can obey the gospel in taking no thought for the morrow if i lose the purity of contemplation i gain by having to obey a rule it is a wretched thing for anyone to undertake some art or study and never become perfect at it 6 now i will shortly explain the great benefits i enjoy here i leave it to you after you have heard my evidence to jxidgc whether the profit to be iound in the desert can compensate for the advantages here and you will be able to decide whether i chose to be shut up in these walls because i disliked the soli tary's purity or because i was aiming at it in this monastery i do not have to arrange my day's work i am not bothered with buying or selling i do not have to think about storing food i am not anxious about preparing to receive the numerous visitors as well as look after the residents and above all i am not subject to popularity nor therefore to the temptation to arrogance which is the worst thing in the desert life and which has been known to do away in god's sight with the merit of desert austerities but passing over the risks of spiritual pride and vanity which afflict hermits i lay the stress on a burden which troubles them all the provision of food the present hermits are not content like the stricter ancients to do without oil they are even beginning to be dissatisfied with the lax rule of the present generation which enacts that for all visitors during the year it shall be enough to provide a pint of oil and a measure of lentils at the moment two or three times that amount is believed to be almost too little our predecessors though more austere than we in following the rules of the desert were accustomed when mixing vinegar and pickle to the conferences of cassian 283 add a single drop of oil to repel the temptation of vanity the present generation are grown so lax that they break an egyptian cheese to give it taste pour in more oil than it needs mix into a single flavour two kinds of food each with its proper taste and each of which could by themselves be refreshing at different meals they are now beginning to own so much that on the excuse of hospitality 5 they keep a blanket in their cells i can hardly say it without shame i pass over the things which specially afflict the worshipping and contemplative mind the frequent meetings with the brothers the duties of receiving guests and bidding them fare well visits lo each other various interminable discussions and pieces of business even when you are at leisure the mind seems taut with expectation of some bother ahead the result of all tliis is that the hermit loses his freedom is shackled in the heavy chain of worry never finds that ineffable eagerness in his heart and so loses the profit of his way of life living in a community and among a crowd of men i am likewise deprived of this contemplative profit but at least i have peace of soul and freedom from business if hermits have not this quiet which is indispensable they will have the austerities of the desert without the benefit of it possibly there might be in the cocnobium some little loss in purity of heart but i shall be satisfied with the compensation of the gospel text a compensation which surely cannot be worth less than all the fruits of the desert that i should take no thought for the morrow and if to the end of my life i am the obedient disciple of an abbot i may in some measure imitate him of whom it is said he humbled himself and became obedient unto death and so 1 may humbly be able to use his words i came not to do mine own will but the will of the father which sent me 9 7 gcrmanus it is obvious that unlike the many ascetics content with the foothills of the two ways of life you have climbed the heights wo would know then what are the res pective goals of the coenobite and the hermit i suppose that this can only be discussed adequately by a man who has long experience in following both ways of perfection and so can show us their value and their aim 8 john i should have defended the absolute assertion that the same person cannot be perfect in both ways of life but i know some few exceptions to the rule if it is difficult enough to find a man who is perfect in one of them how difficult almost 10 phil 8 john 6 38 284 western asceticism impossible to find someone perfect in both if this has ever happened it cannot be put under any general rule you cannot get a universal rule out of a very few instances out of the experi ence of a very few what if a few people have attained a saint liness beyond the common capacity of most men and the frailty of normal human nature we must not draw conclusions valid for everyone and must regard it rather by way of miracle than by way of an example to follow as far as i am able i will now answer your question the coenobite aims at mortifying and crucifying all his self will at taking no thought for the morrow as the gospel says it is plain that only a coenobite can reach this perfection like the man whom the prophet isaiah blesses and praises in these words if thou turn thy foot away from the sabbath from doing thy own will in my holy day and glorify him while thou dost not thine own ways and thine own will is not found to speak a word then shalt thou be delighted in the lord and i will lift thee up above the high places of the earth and will feed thee with the inheritance of jacob thy father for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it the hermit aims at freeing his mind from all earthly thoughts and to unite it with christ so far as his human weakness allows like the man of whom the prophet jeremiah spoke blessed is the man who hath borne the yoke from his youth he shall sit solitary and hold his peace because he hath taken it upon himself the psalmist said i am become like a pelican in the desert i watched and became like a sparrow alone upon the housetop 20 these are the two different aims unless the follower of each way attains his aim he will gain no good from his hermitage or his coenobium 9 each perfection then is partial not complete perfection in the full sense is a gift of god and it is rare indeed the truly perfect man is he who can endure with an equal peace of mind the austerities and loneliness of the desert and the weaknesses of his brethren in the community in neither mode of life is it easy to find a complete person the hermit cannot achieve contempt for material possessions the coenobite cannot achieve the pure prayer of the contemplative i know that abba moses and paphnutius and the two macarii possessed both in completeness they went out beyond the other inhabitants of the desert to lonelier places so far as 20 isa 58 13 14 lam 3 27 8 ps 102 7 8 the conferences of cassian 285 possible they never sought for company and yet they put up with the frailties of all the people who came to see them and profit by them an almost incessant bother accepted with an imperturbable patience and men supposed that they had spent all their lives in learning how to show the usual hospitality to their visitors no one could decide at which kind of life they had progressed further they were great hearted men wonderfully fitted for either kind of life 10 others begin to become rather like animals owing to the long silence and loneliness and slink away from man's approach when they are brought out of retirement for a short time by visiting brethren they shy away with obvious signs of fright this usually happens to people who have become hermits prematurely and without a good previous training in the community life their faults are not eradicated they are as poor hermits as they are coenobites and are blown about here and there by puffs from every troublesome breeze on the one side they are annoyed and impatient at meeting other monks on the other side they dislike the loneliness and silence which they have chosen because they do not even know the true reason for choosing it but think its supreme merit to be a way of avoiding human company or of seeing human faces n germanus what remedy is there for people like our selves whose weakness consists precisely in this that we had too little instruction in the cocnobium and entered the desert life before we had eradicated our faults how can we attain the stable and imperturbable and patient mind we left school too young before we had fully learnt our lessons when we went away from our cocnobium now we arc living in the desert how shall we acquire long suffering and patience living alone we do not meet men who cause us annoyance how shall con science in exploring our inward motives decide whether or not we are right in thinking we possess true peace of mind 12 john god who truly heals souls will certainly offer a remedy to those who truly seek it especially to repentant men who are not hopeless or neglectful of their faults nor conceal them nor wantonly refuse the healing of penitence when the opportunity is offered and to men who fly humbly and prudently to god to heal the sins they have contracted from ignorance or error or necessity if we go into the desert with our faults still hidden within us they no longer hurt others but our love of them remains of every sin not eradicated the root is still growing secretly within 286 western asceticism we can decide whether it is alive by certain tests for example if we receive visitors even for a short stay with the slightest trouble of mind it proves that we still have in us the source from which the tumbling stream of impatience flows or if we are expecting a monk and for some reason he is a little late and our mind is silently indignant with him or annoyed that we have so inconveniently to wait for him it will prove to our conscience that the seeds of anger and grievance are still within if a monk asks us to lend him a book or some other loan and we are saddened by the request or even refuse it that will prove that we are still entangled in the sins of avarice and covetousness if through reading holy scripture or a sudden memory we think of a woman and feel the least lust towards her it shows that lust is not yet extinguished in our body if we compare our own strict discipline with the lax practices of another and feel the slightest temptation to puff ourselves it proves that the terrible plague of pride is still infecting us if we see these signs within we know that it is not the desire to sin but the opportunity to sin which has vanished if ever we started mixing in society again these passions would creep out of their caves and show that they were not new visible at last they had been in us all the time in this way even a hermit can discern whether the roots of sins are eradicated or not if he tries not to show off his purity before other men but only in the sight of him to whom all hearts lie open 13 germanus we see how to discover the signs of weak ness all our daily experience confirms what you have said you have shown us the evidence and causes of the disease now we would know the cure the man who will best talk about the cure of ill health is the man who by the evidence of the patients is most accurate in diagnosis you have so clearly diagnosed the cause of our disease that we have some faint hope of a cure yet your words have driven us into a despair which will destroy our spiritual life you say that in com munities men acquire the first stages in salvation and none can be healthy in solitude unless he has first cured his faults in a coenobium we are afraid that perhaps as we were imperfect when we left our own community it is now impossible for us to be perfect in the desert 14 john people who really want to cure their illness arc sure to find a remedy we ought to look for the cure of each sitt in the same way that we looked for its evidence just as i said the conferences of cassian 287 the faults of ordinary life persist in the solitary's life so i affirm that all the instruments for pursuing virtue and healing are available in the desert if a man discovers by the signs i men tioned that he is liable to impatience and anger he ought ever to be training himself in the virtues opposite to these faults he ought to imagine various injuries being offered to himself by some hypothetical person and so accustom his mind to be per fectly humble and submissive in the face of everything that wickedness can do to him he ought to imagine roughness conduct unbearable against himself and penitently meditate on the gentleness with which he should receive it if he looks at the sufferings of the saints or the passion of the lord he will see that these wrongs and punishments are less than he deserves and will be readier to bear all sorrow and at those times in evitable even in the strictest desert life when he is for some reason summoned to the meeting of the monks he should censor his inner feelings if he finds that he is silently troubled about trivialities and should accuse himself of all those bitter wrongs which his daily meditation has been training him to bear and in self reproach he should say my good man are you the same fellow who set yourself up to overcome all evil while you were at training school in the desert are you the man who lately imagined bitter abuse and unbearable punish ments against yourself and fancied that you were strong enough to bear them without the mind being disturbed is it not remarkable that this unconquerable patience has slipped before an idle word how is it that a mild breeze is rocking the house which you thought to be built on solid rock what has hap pened to that silly longing of yours for war when you were at peace you used to say i am ready and am not troubled and with the prophet prove me o lord and try me search out my reins and my heart 1 and prove me o lord and know my heart question me and know my paths and see if there be any way of wickedness in me 21 have you prepared for war and yet been frightened by a little ghost of an enemy with these penitential reproaches a man should condemn himself and not let the disturbing temptation go unpunished he should fast the more rigorously watch longer in the night restrain his appetites and so crucify by exercises the inconstancy of mind which ought to have been repressed while he was a coenobite one thing we must hold tightly to keep a true and lasting patience it is never lawful for us to be angry because of 21 ps 119 60 26 2 139 23 4 288 western asceticism material loss or mental conflict since god's law forbids us to remember a wrong just as it forbids us to revenge ourselves what worse fate can befall the soul than the loss through a sudden blinding flare of bad temper of the clear vision of the true and eternal light the loss of the contemplation of him who is meek and lowly of heart 3 22 what should twist a man away from his true nature more than the loss of the ability to discern between good and evil to use a sober and disciplined and wise judgement is it not deplorable that a sane and sober man should do what would not be pardoned in a man so tipsy that he was partly out of his senses whoever considers this damage to the soul will bear every variety of loss or injury or punishment of cruel men he will think nothing more damaging than anger nothing more precious than peace of mind and stable purity of heart to find these we ought to lose even spiritual benefits if those spiritual benefits cannot be won without troubling the peace of mind 15 germanus you have shown that the cure for diseases like anger gloom and impatience consists in setting the opposite qualities against them i should like to know what kind of remedy it is possible to bring against the spirit of lust surely the fire cannot here be quenched by imagining temptations i believe that even to glance at the temptation with the mind let alone increasing the incentive is fatal to chastity 16 john the question is a wise one and even if you had not asked it i was being led naturally to it i am sure that the answer is easy for you since you have acutely gone ahead of what i was going to say the puzzle of a question is easily unravelled when the question itself is put in such a way as to imply the right answer for curing the faults which i have been talking about human society so far from being a hindrance is beneficial the more often men see they are impatient the more thoroughly they do penitence and the more rapidly do they achieve a sound mind and since there are no incentives to impatience and irritation in the desert we ought to imagine temptations to it so as to have a struggle and find a cure more rapidly but against lust a different method is needed not only has the body to be deprived of the opportunities the mind has to be brought to forget all about it for weak spirits it is bad enough to admit even a little recollection of it the sort that arises from remember ing a holy woman or reading a passage of holy scripture and 22 matt 1 1 29 the conferences of cassian 289 this was why our elders used wisely to omit passages of this kind when younger monks were present to monks who have won through to perfect chastity there are plenty of tests to determine whether their conscience may judge the heart to be incorrupt to a chaste man there is a test of the same kind if he is sure that the roots of the disease have been eradicated he may explore the grace of his chastity by making some mental fantasy of temptation to men who are still weak this imaginative exploration is more destructive than useful and must be avoided if the perfect man can stand un harmed by this kind of fantasy if his mind and body remain unperturbed he will have a proof of purity and in this purity he will train his mind and will even think it harmful if some necessity forces him into the presence of a woman here abba john ended his conference seeing it was 3 o'clock and time for our meal ill the rule of saint benedict introduction for the place of the rule in early monasticism see the general introduction the best manuscript of the rule appears to be that of saint gall 914 indeed it was argued by ludwig traube that a copy of the autograph of the rule was sent from monte cassino to charlemagne in the year 787 and that the saint gall manuscript is a copy of this copy this hypothesis has been shown to be speculative and it is no longer possible to rule out of account the evidence of a different manuscript tradition represented in particular by the earliest extant manuscript hatton 48 in the bodleian library which cannot have been copied much later than 700 it is possible that the rule was in part a copy of an earlier rule of which we have either the representative or the descendant by a different line in the regula magistri of this rule the known manuscripts go back to the sixth century the matter is still under examination materials for following the debate will be found in the select bibliography in this translation i took as a basis the douai translation of 1 700 but i have revised it very freely indeed and have sought to bring it into line with modern knowledge about the text of the rule 290 ttie rule of saint benedict the text prologue son listen to the precepts of your master take them to your heart willingly if you follow the advice of a tender father and travel the hard road of obedience you will return to god from whom by disobedience you have gone astray i address my discourse to all of you who will renounce your own will enter the lists under the banner of obedience and fight under the lead of your lawful sovereign christ the lord first i advise that you should implore the help of god to accomplish every good work you undertake that he who has now vouchsafed to rank us in the number of his children may be no more grieved at our doing amiss for we ought always to use his grace so faithfully in his service as to give him no occa sion to disinherit his children like an angry parent or to punish for eternity his servants like a master incensed at their crimes servants who have refused to follow him in the way to glory let us then exert ourselves now the scripture awakens us saying now it is the hour to arise from sleep and with eyes wide open to the light of heaven and ears receptive to the word of god let us hear what his voice repeats to us every day today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts and again he who hath ears to hear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches what does he say gome my children hearken unto me and i will teach you the fear of the lord run while ye have the light of life that the darkness of death overtake you not 1 the lord seeking to draw from the crowd one faithful servant asks what man is he that desircth life and would fain see good days 2 if you reply it is i god answers if rom 13 11 ps 95 8 matt 11 15 rev 2 7 ps 34 11 john 12 35 2 ps 34 12 15 29 202 western asceticism you will possess the true and everlasting life keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking guile depart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it and when you have done this then my eyes shall be open upon you and my ears shall listen to your prayers and even before you call upon me i will say behold i am here dearest brethren can we imagine anything more tender than this invitation of our lord see in his goodness he points out to us the way of life let us then gird up our loins let us walk by faith and try to serve him with good works and thereby let us advance in his ways with the gospel as our guide that we may deserve to behold him who has called us to his kingdom if we want to fix our dwelling there we cannot arrive thereto without run ning in the ways of virtue but let us enquire of the lord with the prophet lord who shall dwell in thy tabernacle or who shall rest upon thy holy hill brethren let us hear the lord's answer to the question an answer which shows the way to the heavenly tabernacle he that walketh without blame and does right he that speaketh truth in his heart he that hath kept his tongue from guile hath done no evil to his neighbour and hath not believed slander of his neighbour 3 he who drives the tempter and his temptations far from his heart defeats his malice and dashes his rising thoughts against the rock christ he who fears the lord without growing proud of his virtue and humbly acknowledges that what is good in him does not pro ceed from himself he who gives god his due and with the prophet blesses the work of god in himself not unto us o lord not unto us but unto thy name give the glory the apostle paul found nothing of his own to boast of in his preaching by the grace of god says he i am what i am and again he that glories let him glory in the lord on this account our lord in the gospel tells us he that heareth these words of mine and doeth them i will make him like the wise man who hath built his house upon a rock the floods came and the winds blew and they beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock 4 our lord expects that our works should ever correspond with these declarations of scripture therefore in consideration of the evils which we have to redress he has given us the days of our life and prolongs them to afford us an opportunity of making peace with him dost thou not know says the 3 ps 15 1 3 4 ps 115 1 i cor 15 10 ii cor 10 17 matt 7 24 5 the rule of saint benedict 293 apostle that the patience of god inviteth thee to repentance for our tender lord assures us i will not the death of a sinner but that he should be converted and live 5 when we enquired of the lord about the person who should dwell in his tabernacle we were informed what conditions were necessary for it and it is now ours to perform those conditions 6 therefore our hearts and bodies are to be prepared to fight under his command and we must beseech god to supply with his grace what it is impossible for nature to effect alone more over if we desire to avoid the pains of hell and to compass eternal life we must while we have lime in the body and ability to use the opportunity of a religious life make haste and practise now the virtues which will serve us for all eternity to conclude i am to erect a school for beginners in the service of the lord which i hope to establish on laws not too difficult or grievous but if for reasonable cause for the retrenchment of vice or preservation of charity i require some things which may seem too austere you are not thereupon to be frightened from the ways of salvation those ways are always strait and narrow at the beginning but as we advance in the practices of religion and in faith the heart insensibly opens and enlarges through the wonderful sweetness of his love and we run in the way of god's commandments if then we keep close to our school and the doctrine we learn in it and persevere in the monastery till death we shall here share by patience in the passion of christ and hereafter deserve to be united with him in his kingdom amen i of the several sorts of monks it is well known that there are four sorts of monks the first is of coenobites who dwell in convents under the direction of a rule and an abbot the second is of anchorites or hermits these are not men who have hurried away into solitary cells with the indiscreet zeal of beginners but have served a mature probation in mon asteries and there learnt by the example and help of their fellow monks how to fight the devil and thereafter are suffi ciently appointed without any other help than that of god to 5 rom a 4 ezel 33 1 1 the oxford manuscript of the rule ends the prologue here with and if we perform that duty we doubtless shall become the heirs of heaven but the evidence of regula magistri is now to be added to the evidence from other manuscripts of the rule especially sangallensis that this shorter version of the prologue was not original western asceticism enter the wilderness and fight a single combat against the sins of the flesh and the ill thoughts of the mind the third kind of monks a perniciou5 kind is that of the sarabaites these without any probation of rule or experience which test men as a furnace tests gold live up to the practice of the world like lead in a furnace they live softly and pliably and by their very tonsure they are reproached of their infidelity to god they dwell two or three together or one alone shepherdless in no other fold but that of their own will have no other law but what is agreeable and pleasing they measure the proportion of holiness by their own choice and ideas and call unlawful what they dislike the last sort is of those called gyrovagi or wanderers whose whole life is a ramble from province to province staying three or four days in each place ever in motion and never settled slaves to their pleasures mere epicures worse even than the sarabaites the wretched ways of all these are fitter to be buried in oblivion than to be the subject of our discourse and i pass them over my aim is with god's help to give rules to the most vigorous kind that of the coenobites 2 what qualifications are required for an abbot an abbot qualified to govern a monastery ought always to remember the name he bears and to maintain by his good life the title of superior for he is esteemed to supply the place of christ in the monastery being called by his name according to the apostle ye have received the spirit of the adoption of sons whereby we cry abba father 7 and therefore the abbot ought not to teach establish or command anything contrary to the law of the lord but so to deliver his ordinances and teaching that they may work on the minds of his disciples like a leaven or seasoning of divine justice let the abbot always remember that at the dreadful day of judgement he is accountable for the obedience of his disciples as for his own teaching he is to remember that whatever the father of the family finds ill in the flock shall lie at the shep herd's door he shall not be declared guiltless in the lord's judgement unless he has taken all the pains he can for a dis obedient and turbulent flock if he has used his utmost care to cut out their sins he may say to the lord with the prophet i have not hid thy justice within my heart i have declared thy 7 rom 8 15 the rule of saint benedict truth and thy salvation but they have despised and rejected me 8 and eternal death shall be the punishment of them that have been disobedient to his care when anyone takes upon him the office of abbot he is to instruct his disciples in two ways that is he is to lay before them what is good and holy more by example than by words to teach the law of the lord by word of mouth to such as are of a quicker comprehension and by example to those of harder hearts and meaner capacities he ought to create by his conduct an aversion from the thing which he condemns in his dis course then he will not himself prove a castaway while he preaches to others and will avoid god's reproach wherefore dost thou declare my righteousness and take my testament into thy mouth for thou hatest discipline yea and hast rejected my exhortation and thou hast seen a mole in thy brother's eye and hast not seen the beam in thine own 9 he is not to be partial or to love one more than another unless upon consideration of greater virtue or obedience he is not to prefer the frceborn monk above the slave except some other reasonable cause intervene in such case it is allowable that the abbot should dispose of persons as he judges expedient and fair otherwise everyone is to keep his proper place because whether slaves or freeborn we are all one in christ and we have all enlisted in the same service under one common lord who is no respecter of persons the only reason why god puts one man above another is because the one lives a better life and is humble therefore the abbot's charity must extend equally to all and his discipline be impartial to each according to his merits in his teaching the abbot is ever to observe this rule of the apostle reprove beseech correct 10 which consists in a judicious timing to mix gentleness with sternness at one time to show the severity of a master at another the tenderness of a father to use rigour with the irregular and the turbulent but win to better things the obedient mild and patient i warn him to reprove and chastise the careless or contemptuous nor is he to dissemble the faults of those that go amiss but to do his utmost to root them out as they begin to grow always mindful of the danger of eli the priest of shilohu those who are of nobler character and arc more capable of understanding he is to admonish twice but mere profligates stubborn proud or 8 p 4oiio isa x a ps 50 16 17 matt 7 3 10 ii tim 4 3 296 western asceticism disobedient the moment they begin to do amiss must be re claimed by the rod the abbot must know what is written the fool is not corrected by words and strike thy son with the rod and thou shalt deliver his soul from death n the abbot ought ever to remember what he is and what is meant by the name he bears and to know that more is required of him to whose charge more is committed let him reflect how difficult and perplexing a business he undertakes at once to govern many souls and to be subject to as many humours to suit himself to everyone with regard to their capacity and con dition to win some by fair means others by reprimands others by dint of reason that he may not suffer damage to his flock but rather rejoice at the increase and improvement of it above all he is not to dissemble or undervalue the care of souls committed to his charge for the sake of temporal concerns which are earthly transitory and fleeting but ever to reflect that the government of souls is his business and that he is accountable for them and if perhaps the monastery have too little money he is not to be disturbed thereat but to remember how it is written seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you and again nothing is wanting to them that fear him 12 let him further reflect that he has undertaken the care of souls and is to prepare his accounts let him be sure that at the day of judgement he will be answerable for as many souls as he has brothers as well as for his own if he is ever in dread of the severe examination which he is to undergo for the sheep com mitted to him he will be as careful about himself as he is about his charges and so he will together cure the sins of others by his government and amend the faults in his own life 3 the manner of assembling the community in council whenever any matter of moment is to be debated in the monastery the abbot is to assemble the whole community and to lay open the business before them and after having heard their opinions and maturely debated with himself he may resolve on what he judges most profitable we have for this reason ordained that the whole community shall be assembled because god often reveals what is best to the young the brothers shall give their opiixion with humility and submission and not maintain their judgement with vehemence but leave all to the disposal of the abbot and jointly 11 prov 18 2 29 19 23 13 14 12 matt 6 133 ps 34 xo the rule of saint benedict 2q7 assent to what he decides fit yet as it is the duty of the disciple to obey his master so it is no less the part of the master to decide according to the rules of equity and prudence all are to observe the rule as their guide and no one is rashly to deviate from it no one in the monastery is to be biased by his self will nor may anyone argue with his abbot with heat when at home or at all when abroad if he does he shall be liable to regular chastisement nevertheless the abbot himself is to act in everything with a regard to the rule and in fear of god knowing that in all his proceedings he is to give an account before the truly impartial judge if any matter of lesser consequence is to be decided for the advantage of the house he is only to consult the elders accord ing as it is written do thou nothing without counsel and thou shalt not repent when thou hast done 13 4 of the instruments of good works first to love the lord god with all the heart with all the soul and with all the strength next to love the neighbour as oneself next not to kill not to commit adultery not to steal not to covet not to bear false witness to honour all men not to do to another what we would not have done to ourselves to renounce oneself in order to follow christ to chastise the body not to seek after pleasure to love fasting to relieve the poor to clothe the naked to visit the sick to bury the dead to help those that are in trouble to comfort the afflicted to eschew the ways of the world to prefer nothing before the love of christ not to give way to anger not to lay up revenge ecdcsiasticus 32 19 298 western asceticism not to cover deceit in the heart not to make a pretended peace not to forsake charity not to swear for fear of being perjured to speak truth from the heart as well as the mouth not to return evil for evil not to do an injury but to bear one with patience to love our enemies not to return curse for curse but rather a blessing for it to suffer persecution for righteousness sake not to be proud not given to wine not given to too much eating not to sleepiness not to laziness not to complaining not to detraction to repose all trust in god to attribute all the good we have in us to god and not to ourselves to acknowledge all evil to be our own and to impute it to ourselves to fear the day of judgement to dread hell to long in the spirit for eternal life to keep death every day before our eyes to keep a continual watch over our actions to be convinced that god sees us wherever we are to dash evil thoughts as soon as they arise in the heart against the rock christ and to discover them to our spiritual father to preserve the tongue from evil and wicked talk not to love much talk not to love vain talk or such as occasions laughter not to love much or raucous laughter to listen willingly to the reading of holy books to use frequent prayer to confess to god every day in prayer with tears and sighs our past offences to amend those sins for the future not to accomplish the desires of the flesh to hate our own will in all things to obey the abbot's command although which the rule of saint benedict god forbid he act contrary himself being mindful of the precept of the lord which bids us do what they say not what they do 14 not to want to be called a saint before we are but first to be so that it may be said of us with greater truth every day to live up to the commandments of god to love chastity to hate nobody not to be addicted to jealousy not to be envious not to love contention to avoid ambition to venerate the elders to love the younger to pray for our enemies for the love of christ to be reconciled to those who have quarrelled with us before the sun go down and never to despair of god's mercy these are the instruments of spiritual progress if day and night we employ them and at the day of judgement commend them into the hands of god we shall be crowned with the reward he has promised which neither eye hath seen nor ear hath heard nor hath it entered into the heart of man what things god hath prepared for them that love him 15 the best place to practise these things is the monastery with its seclusion provided that we remain steadily in the com munity and do not leave it 5 of obedience the first degree of humility is a prompt and ready obedience this is fitting for them who love christ above all else by reason of the holy duty they have undertaken or for fear of hell or for eternal glory they make no more delay to comply the very instant anything is appointed them than if god himself had given the command of these the lord said at the very sound of my voice he hath obeyed me and again he declared to them that teaeh he that hcarcth you hcareth me l they who arc of this temper abandon all even to their very will instantly clear their hands and leave unfinished what they had begun so that the command is carried out in the moment it is uttered master and disciple are lent wings by the fear of n matt 23 3 i i cor a sg i ps 18 44 luke 10 s t6 300 western asceticism god and the longing for eternal life and so the command obeyed in a flash it is for the sake of obedience that they enter into the narrc way of which the lord said narrow is the way that leade unto life 17 the narrowness of the way is opposite to t broad way suggested by self will and desire and pleasure a they follow it by delighting to dwell in a community to subject to their abbot and to follow the judgement of anoth such men live up to the practice of our lord who tells us came not to do mine own will but the will of him that se me 18 this obedience will be pleasing to god and man when it performed with no fear no delay no coldness no complaii no reply the obedience we pay to superiors is paid to god i he tells us he that heareth you heareth me and it is to done with willing heart because god loveth a chccrj giver 19 when the disciple obeys unwillingly with a grud in heart or mouth though he does the thing yet he is so i from being pleasing to god who sees reluctance in the hca that he acquires no merit but only incurs the penalty of the that murmur till he has made a due atonement 6 of silence let us do as the prophet says i said i will take heed un my ways that i offend not with my tongue i have set a guaj upon my mouth i held my tongue and was humbled and kc silence from good words 20 here the prophet shows that for the sake of silence we ought sometimes not to speak what good much more are we obliged to avoid all evil talk for fe of the punishment due to sin therefore frequent leave to ta is not to be granted to those who are advanced in perfection although the subject be good and holy and edifying becaui it is written in much talk you shall not avoid sin and els where life and death are in the power of the tongue 21 belongs to the master to speak and teach it is the duty of tt disciple to hear and obey and therefore if anything is to be asked from the superio it must be with humility and submission as for scurrility id jests or silly talk i order that they be never heard in the mor astery 17 matt 7 14 i john 6 38 w 11 cor 9 7 20 ps 39 1 2 21 p r ov 10 19 and 18 21 the rule of saint benedict 30 7 of humility brethren the scripture asserts that everyone that exalte th himself shall be humbled and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted it shows us thereby that all exaltation is in some measure the pride which the prophet tells us he took care to shun o lord my heart is not exalted nor mine eyes lifted up i have not aspired to great things nor wonders above myself and his reason for it is because says he if i had not thought humbly of myself but had exalted my soul thou wouldst have driven away my soul like an infant weaned from the breast of its mother 22 therefore brethren if we want to attain true humility and come quickly to the top of that heavenly ascent to which we can only mount by lowliness in this present life we must ascend by good works and erect the mystical ladder of jacob where angels ascending and descending appeared to him that ascent and descent means that we go downward when we exalt ourselves and rise when we are humbled the ladder represents our hfe in this world which our lord erects to heaven when our heart is humbled and the sides of the ladder represent our soul and body sides between which god has placed several rungs of humility and discipline whereby we are to ascend if we would answer his call the first degree then of humility is to have the fear of god ever before our eyes never to forget what is his due and always to remember his commands to revolve in the mind how hell burns those who have contemned god and how god has prepared eternal life for them that fear him to preserve our selves from the sins and vices of thought of the tongue the eyes hands feet self will and fleshly desires man ought to think that god always looks down from heaven upon him and that all he does lies open to his sight is daily told him by the angels the prophet shows this truth when he describes god as present in our thoughts searching the heart and reins and our lord knows the thoughts of men and again thou hast understood my thoughts a great way off and the thought of man shall confess to thee that he may ever watch the perverscness of his thoughts let the right minded brother continually repeat in the language of his heart then i shall be without blemish before him if i keep myself from mine iniquity 23 22 luke 14 11 ps 131 i 2 23 ps 7 9 94 1 1 regula magistri and a few mss add the second half of the versicle 139 1 76 10 18 23 302 western asceticism as for our own will we are forbidden to pursue it by these words of the scripture turn away from thine own will and we are required to ask of god in prayer that his will may be done in us we have reason to be convinced that we ought not to be guided by our own will when we take account of what the scripture tells us there are ways which to men appear to be right whose endings nevertheless plunge us into the very depth of hell and again when we reflect fearfully upon the character given to the negligent they are corrupt and become abominable in their own pleasures as regards our sensual desires we must remember that god is ever present as the prophet says to the lord all my desire lies open before thee 24 so unlawful desires are to be care fully avoided because death lurks behind the door at the very entrance to pleasure whence the scripture forbids us to pursue our lusts 25 if then the eyes of the lord observe both the good and the wicked and god looks down from heaven upon the sons of men to see if there be any that understand or seek after god and again if night and day our guardian angels give an account of what we do to the lord we must every moment be on our guard lest god at any time should surprise us as the psalmi t terms it leaning towards evil and rendered unprofitable and sparing us in this life because he is good and waits for our becoming better should reproach us in the next these tjiings didst thou do and i kept silence 2 j the second degree of humility is if anyone not wedded to his own will finds no pleasure in the compassing of his desires but fulfils with his practice the word of our lord i came not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me the scrip ture also says pleasure hath it penalty but need winncth a crown the third degree of humility is when anyone submits himself with obedience to his superior for the sake of the love of god after the example of the lord of whom the apostle says he was made obedient even unto death the fourth degree of humility is when anyone in the practice of obedience meets with hardship contradictions or affronts 24 ecclesiasticus 18 30 prov 16 255 ps 14 1 38 9 25 ecclesiasticus 18 30 2 jprov 15 3 ps 14 3 53 2 3 50 21 7 john 6 s8 the second text is not from the bible but from e.g acta martyrum the rule of saint benedict 303 and yet bears them all with a quiet conscience and with patience and continues to persevere the scripture says he who per severes to the end the same shall be saved and again let your heart be strengthened and wait for our lord and to show that the faithful servant ought to suffer every trial for god the scripture speaks in the person of those that suffer for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter and afterwards in full assurance of their reward they say with happiness but in all these things we are conquerors through him that loved us in another place the scripture tells us thou o god hast proved us thou hast tried us with fire as silver is tried thou hast led us into the snare and loaded us with afflictions and to show that we ought to live under a superior it goes on thou hast set men over our heads 28 so these sufferers live up to the command of god bearing injuries and adversity with patience but more struck on one cheek they offer the other they give away their coat to him that takes away their cloak forced to walk one mile they go two they bear with false brethren like paul the apostle they bless them that curse them the fifth degree of humility is humbly to confess to the abbot every unlawful thought as it arises in the heart and the hidden sins we have committed the scripture advises this saying reveal your way to god and hope in him and again confess to god because he is good for his mercy endureth for over 29 and in the prophet i have made known my sin to thee and have not covered my iniquities i have said i will declare to god my own iniquities against myself and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my heart 30 the sixth degree of humility is if a monk be content with anything though never so vile and contemptible and to think himself inadequate and unworthy to succeed in whatever he is commanded to do saying with the prophet i was brought to nothing and knew nothing i am become like a brute beast before thee yet i am always with thee 31 the seventh degree of humility is when one does not merely call oneself the least and most abject of all mankind but believes it with sincerity of heart humbling oneself and saying with the prophet i am a worm and no man a scorn of men and the outcast of the people i have been exalted humbled and 28 matt io as ps 271x4 rom 8 36 7 ps 6 20 ps 37 5 106 1 30 ps 32 5 si p s 73 31 3 304 western asceticism confounded 9 and again it is good for me that thou hast humbled me that i may learn to keep thy commandments 32 the eighth degree of humility is when a monk does nothing but what is countenanced by the constitutions of the monastery or the example of the elders the ninth degree of humility is when a monk controls his tongue and keeps silence till a question be asked for the scripture teaches that in much talk you will not avoid sin ning and the talkative man shall live out his life hap hazardly 3 3 the tenth degree of humility is not easily to lay hold on occasions of laughing for it is written he who laughs loud is a fool 34 the eleventh degree of humility is when a monk discourses with moderation and composure mixing humility with gravity speaking few words but home and to the purpose not raising the voice the wise man is known because he speaks little 35 the twelfth degree of humility is when the monk's inward humility appears outwardly in his comportment and wherever he be in the divine office in the oratory in the monastery in the garden on a journey in the fields wherever he is sitting walking or standing he is to look down with bowed head con scious of his guilt imagining himself ready to be called to give account at the dread judgement repeating in his heart what the publican in the gospel said with eyes downcast lord i am not worthy sinner that i am to lift up my eyes to heaven and with the prophet i am bowed down and humbled on every side 36 after he has climbed all these degrees of humility the monk will quickly arrive at the top the charity that is perfect and casts out all fear and then the virtues which first he practised with anxiety shall begin to be easy for him almost natural being grown habitual he will no more be afraid of hell but will advance by the love of christ by good habits and by taking pleasure in goodness our lord by the holy spirit will deign to show this in the servant who has been cleansed from sin 8 of the divine office during the night in the winter time that is from the first day of november until easter having regard to different circumstances they shall 32 ps 22 6 88 15 119 71 33p

that they may have time to rest till after midnight and the time of digestion be past what time remains after the office is done they may use in studying the psalms and lessons if they do not yet know them thoroughly from easter to the first of november they shall so arrange the night office as to leave a very short interval after it so that the brothers may go out for the needs of nature and then begin lauds at break of day 9 how many psalms are to be said at the night office in the winter they shall first say three times the versicle o lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise then recite psalm 3 and the gloria afterwards psalm 94 is to be sung with an antiphon or at least sung then the hymn of st ambrose then six psalms with antiphons then after the versicle the abbot is to give the blessing and when all are in their seats the brothers shall read by turns three lessons out of the book upon the lectern after each they shall chant three responsories two of the responsories shall be said without the gloria after the third lesson the cantor shall say the gloria as soon as he begins to say it all shall rise from their scats out of honour and reverence to the holy trinity at the night office they shall read the inspired books of the old or new testaments and also the commentaries written upon them by those fathers who are celebrated catholic and orthodox after these three lessons with their responsories six other psalms are to be sung with alleluia then a lesson out of the apostle to be said by heart afterwards the versicle and the litany that is kyrie eleison and so shall end the night office 10 the manner of the night office during summer from easter to the first of november the same distribution of psalms is to be observed as aforesaid except that the lessons out of the book shall be omitted by reason of the shortness of the nights in summer and one lesson of the old testament shall be said by heart in place of the other three and a short respon sory follow the rest must remain as before so that there be never fewer than twelve psalms said in the night office besides the third and the ninety fourth psalms 1 1 the manner of the night office on sundays on sundays they shall rise earlier to the night office and shall observe this order after six psalms as above and the versicle everyone shall sit each in his place and they shall read 306 western asceticism from the book in the manner we have already mentioned four lessons with their responsories so that the gloria be only sung by the cantor at the fourth responsory and as soon as the gloria begins everyone shall rise from his seat out of reverence after these four lessons six other psalms shall follow in order with their antiphons and versicle like the earlier psalms then they shall read four more lessons with their responsories in the same way as before next they shall say three canticles from the prophets as the abbot shall appoint these shall be sung with alleluia then when the versicle has been said and the abbot has given the blessing they shall read four lessons more of the new testament according to the same order after the fourth responsory the abbot shall begin the hymn te deum laudamus after that the abbot shall read the lesson from the gospel everyone standing in reverence and at the end of it they shall all answer amen then the abbot shall add the hymn te decet laus and after the blessing they shall begin lauds this order for the night office on sundays shall be observed throughout the year summer and winter unless though god forbid they should chance to rise late and so be forced to omit something of the lessons or responsories this is carefully to be avoided but if it should happen notwithstanding he whose negligence caused it shall make due satisfaction to god in the oratory 12 the manner of saying the office of lauds at lauds on sundays they shall recite first psalm 66 without an antiphon next psalm 50 with alleluia then psalms 117 and 62 then the canticle benedidte and the laudate psalms then the lesson from the apocalypse to be said by heart the responsory the hymn of st ambrose the versicle the canticle from the gospel the kyrie eleison and so end 13 qnferias the office of lauds shall be in the manner fol lowing psalm 66 shall be said without an antiphon as on sundays and leisurely that all

on each day according to the custom of the church at rome the rule of saint benedict 30 after this shall follow the laudate psalms a lesson of the apostle to be said by heart responsory hymn of st ambrose canticle of the gospel kyrie eleison and so end at the hours of lauds and vespers they shall always end with the our father to be said aloud by the president so that all may hear this is because of the animosities and scandals which are wont to arise in monasteries by the promise they make to god when they say in the prayer forgive us as we forgive the religious may abolish this vice amongst themselves at the other hours only the last clause of the prayer shall be said aloud and all shall answer but deliver us from evil 14 the order of the night office on the festivals of saints on the festivals of saints or other solemnities they shall observe the same order as on sundays except that they shall say the psalms antiphons and lessons proper for the day but the number shall be kept as before 15 at what times alleluia is to be said from the holy feast of easter till whitsuntide alleluia is to be said with both the psalms and the responsories but from whitsuntide to the beginning of lent only with the second six psalms at the night office every sunday except in lent the alleluia shall be said with the canticles and the psalms of lauds prime tercc scxt and none and

these day hours that he said seven times a day have i praised thee elsewhere the same prophet makes mention of the night office at midnight i rose to confess to thee at these times therefore let us render praise to our creator tor the judgements of his justice 7 that is lauds prime tercc sext none vespers compline and let us rise at night to confess to him 17 how many psalms are to be said at these hours the psalms of the night office and of lauds arc appointed we now proceed to the other hours at prime they shall say 37 ps 1 19 164 and 6a 308 western asceticism three psalms with a gloria after each the hymn of this hour shall be said after the versicle cc o god make speed to save me before the psalms begin then at the end of the three psalms they shall say one lesson versicle kyrie eleison and so end the same order shall be observed at terce sext and none beginning with the versicle o god make speed to save me the respective hymn of the hour three psalms lesson versicle kyrie eleison and so end if the community be numerous they shall be sung with antiphons otherwise not at vespers they shall say four psalms with their antiphons after these psalms a lesson with its responsory the hymn of st ambrose a versicle the canticle of the gospel kyrie eleison our father and so end at compline they shall recite three psalms only without antiphon and plainly afterwards the proper hymn lesson versicle kyrie eleison and the blessing to end 1 8 after what order the psalms are to be said first shall be said the versicle o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me and gloria afterwards a hymn proper to each hour for sunday prime they shall say four divisions of psalm 1 18 at the three other hours terce sext and none three other divisions of the same psalm 118 for prime on mondays they shall say three psalms 1,2 and 6 and so every day until sunday they shall continue to say at prime three psalms choosing them in order till psalm 19 is reached but always dividing psalm 9 and psalm 1 7 into two by this means they shall always begin the night office of sunday with psalm 20 for terce sext and none on mondays they shall employ the nine remaining divisions of psalm 118 three at each hour the whole of psalm 1 18 being thus said in the two days sunday and monday on tuesday for terce sext and none they shall say three psalms at each hour chosen from psalm 119 to psalm 127 which makes nine psalms these are to be repeated every day till sunday at the same hours the order for the hymns lessons and versicles shall not vary on any day so shall they always begin psalm 1 18 on sunday vespers shall be sung every day with four psalms taken from the psalms numbered 109 to 147 except those which are taken up for the other hours namely psalms 117 to 127 133 and 142 apart from these exceptions all these psalms are to be said at the rule of saint benedict 309 vespers and because there are three less than there should be they shall divide the longer psalms into two namely psalms 1 38 143 and 144 but because psalm 116 is very short it shall be joined with psalm 115 apart from psalms the rest of the vesper office lessons responsories hymns versicles and can ticles shall be as i have said at compline they shall always repeat the same psalms 4 90 these are the arrangements for the psalmody at the day offices the remaining psalms are to be distributed equally among the seven night offices dividing the longer psalms and always assigning twelve for each night notwithstanding we hereby declare that if anyone does not approve of the present distribution of psalms he may appoint otherwise if he thinks better provided he takes care that the whole psalter of a hundred and fifty psalms be sung every week and that they begin it again at the night office each sunday it is a mean devotion if monks should in a week sing less than the whole psalter with the usual canticles we read that our holy fathers bravely recited the psalter in a single day god grant that we their degenerate sons may do the like in seven 19 how we ought to sing we believe god is everywhere and his eye beholds the good and wicked wherever they are so we ought to be particularly assured of his special presence when we assist at the divine office therefore we must always remember the advice of the prophet to serve god in fear to sing wisely and that the angels are witnesses of what we sing 38 let us then reflect what behaviour is proper for appearing in the presence of god and the angels and so sing our psalms that the mind may echo in harmony with the voice 20 what reverence is needed for prayer if we want to ask a favour of any person of power we pre sume not to approach but with humility and respect how much more ought we to address ourselves to the lord and god of all things with a humble and entire devotion we are not to imagine that our prayers shall be heard because we use many words but because the heart is pure and the spirit penitent therefore prayer must be short and pure unless it be prolonged 3prov 15 3 ps a:n 47 7 138 1 310 western ascejticism by a feeling of divine inspiration prayer in common ought always to be short and when the sign is given by the superior all should rise together 21 of the deans of the monastery if the community be numerous they shall make choice of religious persons of good reputation and exemplary lives and appoint them deans they shall govern their respective charges according to the laws of god and the commands of their abbot they are to be so qualified that the abbot may safely entrust part of his duty to their hands they shall not be elected according to their seniority but with regard to their conduct and their wisdom in teaching and if perhaps one of them be found blamable for pride and does not make amends even after three rebukes he shall be removed from office and another worthy shall be substituted in his place as regards the prior we ordain the same 22 how the monks are to sleep each monk shall sleep in a separate bed in arranging the dormitory the abbot shall take account of seniority and spiritual progress if possible everyone shall sleep in the same room but if their numbers do not permit then they shall sleep by tens or twenties with their seniors among them to take care of them a lamp shall burn in the room throughout the night they shall sleep in their habits and girt with their girdles or cords not with knives at their side or they might hurt iherti selves in their sleep thus they will be ready to rise the instant the bell rings and hurry to be first at the divine office yet witli all gravity and composure the younger brothers shall not have their beds near each other but split up among the seniors as they rise for the office they shall softly exhort each other to take away the excuses of those who are sleepy 23 of excommunication imposed for faults if any of the community prove rebellious disobedient proud or tntirrtitiring or contemptuously disobey the holy rule or the commands of his elders he shall be admonished according to the precept of our lord once and then twice by the seniors in private if notwithstanding he does not mend his ways he shall be publicly rebuked if then he remains incorrigible and under stands how great the penalty is he shall be excommunicated if he be obstinate he shall be liable to corporal punishment the rule of saint benedict 24 the measure of excommunication the excommunication or correction ought to be in pro portion to the fault committed and the judgement of it shall depend on the abbot's discretion if anyone be found guilty of lesser faults he shall be deprived of the common task in the following way persons thus deprived shall not conduct psalm or antiphon in the oratory or read any lesson until satisfaction is made they shall eat their meal alone after the community has done for example if the community dines at noon the delinquent shall eat at 3 o'clock if they at three he shall not eat till the evening and this until he has deserved his pardon by a due atonement 25 of greater faults the brother who is convicted of greater faults shall be sus pended both from the table and from the oratory none of the community shall keep company or converse with him he shall pursue alone the work enjoined to him in tears of penance meditating the terrible saying of the apostle such a person is made over to satan for the destruction of the body to the end the soul may be saved at the day of the lord 39 he shall eat alone when and what the abbot thinks fit he shall not receive the blessing from anyone that passes by nor shall the meat be blessed that is given to him 26 of them who company without leave with excommunicated persons if any brother without the abbot's order presume to con verse at all with an excommunicated person or send a message to him he shall incur the same punishment 27 what care the abbot is to take of those that lie under excommunication let the abbot use his utmost care on behalf of those that do amiss for they that be whole need not a physician but they that arc sick and therefore he ought to employ his whole address like an experienced physician and dexterously convey experienced elders to them who know how to encourage the wavering brother and win him insensibly to humble himself and make amends and to give him comfort that ho may not be overpowered with excess of grief as the apostle says let charity be redoubled towards him 40 and the prayers of all be offered for him w i cor 5 5 4 matt 9 i a ii cor 7 8 312 western asceticism for the abbot is to be solicitous about delinquents he is to take all pains and use all his wisdom to prevent any of his flock from perishing he must know that he has taken his office not to tyrannize over souls that are well but to take care of souls that are sick let him stand in awe of the reproach which god menaces by the mouth of the prophet you chose what seemed thriving and likely and you cast away what was weak and in firm 41 and he should imitate the example of the good shepherd who left ninety and nine of his flock in the mountains and went to seek the one which was gone astray and took so much compassion on its weakness that he deigned to lay it on his sacred shoulders and bring it back to the flock 28 of those who will not amend after frequent correction if a brother after frequent corrections for any fault or even after excommunication does not amend his ways he shall be punished with more severity that is with the rod and if still he remains incorrigible or if god forbid he grow proud and takes upon him to justify his proceedings then the abbot must do what the prudent physician does if he has endeavoured to soothe his distemper with the heal ing balm of good counsel and the remedy of holy scripture and if he has applied the more violent medicines of excom munication and the rod and still he sees that all his efforts are of no avail let him try his greatest means prayer by himself and his community that god who can do all things may vouchsafe to work the cure but if this also has no effect then let the abbot use the surgeon's knife and sever the infected member from the com munity as the apostle says drive away the evil man from among you and again if the unfaithful man goes away let him go 42 and then one diseased sheep will not infect the flock 29 whether they who leave the monastery are to be received again the brother who by his own fault goes out of the monastery and desires to return shall first give caution for his sincere amendment of the fault for which he left the place and then be received into the lowest rank to make trial of his humility and if he does the same again he shall be admitted to the third 4i ezek 34 13

suited to everyone's age and capacity and therefore the faults of children or younger people who do not understand how great is the penalty of excom munication are to be corrected with severe fasts or whipping 31 what qualities are required in the cellarer of the monastery the cellarer of the monastery shall be chosen out of the com munity discreet mature in his behaviour and sober no glut ton not proud factious truculent slow or prodigal but one who fears god and who can act like a father to the whole com munity he is to take care of everything to do nothing but what the abbot commands to observe orders and not to irritate the brethren if a brother chance to demand anything unreasonable of him he is not to be contemptuous in his refusal but to refuse reasonably and humbly he is to be careful of his own soul and remember that st paul says he that has done his duty well gains for himself a good degree 44 he is to show a particular concern for the sick children strangers and the poor as being accoxmtablc for them at the day of judgement he is to regard the movables and estate of the monastery as sacred like the vessels on the altar to undervalue nothing to observe a middle way between meanness and prodigality not to waste the property of the monastery but to act with modera tion and with regard to the abbot's command in particular he is to be humble so that when he has not the wherewithal to grant what is asked at least he may afford good words remembering that the scripture said a good word is above the greatest gift 45 he shall have under his care whatever the abbot appoints and not meddle with anything he forbids he shall give the 43 there is a difficulty of interpretation here complicated by a textual crux among the manuscripts as the scribes and commentators struggled to make clear what was meant or what they thought was meant was the monk who was driven out for a fault allowed three chances of returning or was it simply three chances for the monk who left the monastery voluntarily many modern commentators think the second many early scribes thought that the first is what was meant 44 i tim 3 13 45 ecclesiasticus 18 17 314 western asceticism

of god shall be troubled or irritated 32 of the tools and property of the monastery the abbot shall choose some of the brothers on whose life and conduct he can rely and make them responsible for the goods of the monastery tools clothing and the rest any of the property that he thinks right he shall keep an inventory of these things himself so that when the brothers succeed one another in these places he may know what he is giving and what he receives back and if any one is found to have impaired the goods of the monastery by being slovenly or neglectful he shall be corrected and if he does not amend he shall incur punishment in accordance with the rule 33 whether monks ought to have any property the vice of possessing property is particularly to be banished from the monastery no one may presume to give or receive anything without the abbot's leave or to possess anything whatever not even book or tablets or pen the monks bodies and their wills are not at their own disposal they must look to all their needs to be supplied by the common father of the monastery no one may have anything which the abbot does not give or permit everything shall be in common as the scripture sayst nor shall they presume to call anything their own 47 and if anyone be found inclined to this especial vice he shall be told of it once and twice and if he do not make amends he shall be liable to punishment 34 whether everyone ought to have the same the scripture tells us it was divided to every man severally as he had need we distinguish partiality which may god forbid from a consideration of infirmities he that needs less should give god thanks and not be vexed he that needs more has an occasion to humble himself for his own infirmity and no 46 matt 18 6 47 acts 4 32 and 35 the rule of

to be severely punished 35 of the weekly officers in the kitchen the brothers are to serve by turns and no one is exempt from duty in the kitchen unless he be hindered by ill health or cm ployed on some business for the good of the monastery from this service a monk learns charity and gains a greater degree of merit notwithstanding they shall provide assistance for the weak to take away all occasion for grievance and in general everyone shall have help with regard to the circumstances of the community and the situation of the place if the community be numerous the cellarer shall be exempt from the kitchen as well as those aforesaid who are more profitably employed the others shall serve each other in charity he who has finished his week on saturday shall clean every thing and wash the towels which the brothers have used to dry their hands and feet and with his incoming successor of the next week he shall wash the feet of the whole community he shall restore to the cellarer the vessels which belong to his office and restore them clean and undamaged and the cellarer shall deliver them to the next man so that he may keep a weekly check upon them an hour before meals the weekly officer may be allowed to take a drink and a piece of bread above the usual allowance and so be able to serve his brothers at meals without complaint or too great hardship but on great festivals he shall abstain until the end of the office on sundays after lauds the weekly officers ending and beginning shall kneel down before the whole community in the oratory and ask their prayers the officer who has ended his week shall say this verse blessed art thou o lord who hast helped me and comforted me 48 and after this has been said three times he shall receive a blessing then the officer who is beginning his week shall say the verse o god make speed to save me o lord make haste to help me and after everyone has repeated this three times he shall receive his blessing enter upon his duties 48 p s 86 17 316 western asceticism 36 of the sick brothers the care of the sick is to be put before everything else they are to be tended as christ himself who tells us i was sick and you visited me and inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these you have done it unto me 49 the sick on their side are to reflect that the attention paid to them is for the honour of god and they are not to be a grievance to those that tend them by demanding too much yet even if they ask too much they are to be borne with for thereby they are a means to a greater reward the abbot is to take great care that they do not suffer by the negligence of those who look after them an infirmary apart is to be appointed for their care and one to look after it who fears god and is diligent and solicitous the use of baths may be allowed to the sick as often as may be fitting but for those who are well and particularly young people only seldom the sick who are very weakly are to be allowed to eat meat to help their recovery but as soon as their health is re established they are to abstain like the rest the abbot is to take great care that the sick be not neglected by the cellarer or those that look after them the fault of his disciples is in some measure his own fault 37 of old men and children although nature of its own accord is inclined to take pity on old men and children yet it is better they should be provided for by the authority of the rule their weakness is always to be considered and the rigour of the rule about eating is not to be enforced they shall be shown tenderness and given leave to eat before the proper times 38 of the weekly reader there shall be reading during meals the reader shall not be anyone whoever happens to pick up the book one person shall read for a week beginning on sunday as he enters on his week after the office and the communion he shall ask everyone for their prayers that god may preserve him from the spirit of vanity in the oratory he shall begin the verse o lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise and everyone shall repeat it three times then he shall receive the blessing and so enter upon his office matt 25 36 40 the rule of saint benedict 317 complete silence shall be kept during meals there shall be no whispering no one is to say anything except the reader the brothers are to supply each other with what they need in the way of food and drink so that no one needs to ask for anything if anything is lacking they are to ask for it by a sign not by speaking no one is to ask questions about what is read or about any other subject so that no one will have to answer the one exception is if the superior wishes to say a few words that are edifying the weekly reader may take a little food before he begins to read so that he may share in the meal with sanctification and so that he does not find difficulty in fasting a long time he can eat after the community meal with the brothers who during that week are serving in the kitchen not all the brothers in turn are to read or to sing only those whose reading or singing edifies the listener 39 of the quantity of food i am of the opinion that for normal nourishment whether they are eating at noon or 3 o'clock two dishes will be sufficient at each meal this is to provide for the weakness of different people so that the brother who cannot eat one dish may per haps be able to eat the other all the brethren are to be content with these two hot dishes and if fruit or young vegetables can conveniently be had they may be allowed a third a full pound of bread shall suffice for a whole day whether they dine and sup or have only one meal if they sup as well as dine the cellarer shall keep a third part of the bread for the evening notwithstanding it shall be in the abbot's power to increase the allowance if he thinks fit for those with heavier work yet he must take care to avoid excess or sudden temptation to gluttony for nothing is so contrary to the life of a christian as overeating as our lord said take heed lest at any time your hearts be charged with surfeiting 50 the same quantity is not to be given to the younger children they should be given less than the others and always be frugal except the very weak no one shall eat meat at any time 40 of the quantity of drink every man hath his proper gift from god the one after this manner and another after that 51 so it is a nice point to so luke 21 134 5i i cor 7 7 318 western asceticism prescribe a certain measure of food and drink for others not withstanding having regard to the weakness of the sick i am of opinion that a hemina 52 of wine every day will suffice yet be it known to those whom god has granted the gift of absti nence that they shall have an especial reward if the necessity of the place or the hard work or the heat of the summer makes them need more it shall be in the power of the superior to add to the allowance yet always with caution that they may not fall to the temptations of satiety and drunken ness although we read 53 that wine is never for monks it is hard to persuade modern monks of this at least we must all agree that we are not to drink to satiety but with moderation for wine makes even wise men to fall into apostasy 54 where the poverty of the place prevents this measure being available but much less or even none at all the monks there ate to bless god and not complain i give this especial instruction that no one shall complain 41 what hours are most convenient for meals from easter to whitsuntide the community shall dine at noon and sup in the evening but from whitsuntide to the end of the summer if they are not working in the fields or troubled by an excessively hot summer they shall fast on wednesdays and fridays until three in the afternoon on other days they shall dine at noon when working in the fields or oppressed by heat they shall dine at noon every day if the abbot thinks fit but he must so moderate and dispose everything that souls may be saved and that the brothers may do their work without having good reason to complain from september i4th until the beginning of lcnt the com munity shall always eat at three in the afternoon in lent and until easter they are to eat in the evening but at such a time that they do not need lamps and the meal may be finished in daylight at all times they must so manage the hour of the meal whether they dine or sup that it is in daylight 42 of silence after compline monks at all times ought to study silence but most of all during the night throughout the year whether they are having supper or fasting a similar rule shall apply in the time of year 52 quantity unknown probably between a pint and half a pint in vitae patritm v 4.3 1 see page 53 above 4 ecclesiasticus 19 2 the rule of saint benedict 319 when they are having suppers as soon as they rise from the table they shall assemble in one place and one of them shall read the conferences or the lives of the fathers or at least some book which will edify the listeners they are not to read the first seven books of the bible or the book of kings because that part of scripture is not profitable to weak understandings at such a time these books are to be read at other times if it is a time of year when they are fasting they are to leave a short interval after vespers and assemble as before for the reading of the conferences the reader shall read four or five pages or as much as time allows during this interval anyone who has been occupied on special duties has time to join the assembled brothers when they arc all present they shall say compline and after compline no one shall be allowed to speak if any be discovered to break this rule of silence he shall be gravely punished unless it be on account of guests and their needs and even then it must be done with composure and moderation and gentleness 43 of those who come late to the divine office or to table as soon as the bell rings everyone shall leave the work he has upon his hands and hasten to the office as quickly as he can though without rudeness and so that there is no place for jesting nothing shall be put before the work of god if anyone comes to the night office after the gloria of psalm 94 a psalm which with this in mind we wish to be recited very slowly he shall not take his place in the choir but stand lowest of all or in a place apart appointed by the abbot for the negligent so that he may be seen by the abbot and the com munity until he do public penance at the end of the divine office i have thought it right that they should stand in the lowest place or in a place apart so that the very shame of being seen by everybody may reform them for if they remain outside the oratory they may be inclined to return to bed again and sleep or at least to sit down outside and trifle away the time and so give the evil spirit his opportunity therefore they arc to enter the oratory so that they are present for part of the office and may amend for the future he who comes late to the hours of the day office after the versicle and the gloria of the first psalm which is said after the versicle shall stand in die lowest place as above and not presume to join in choir till he has made satisfaction unless the 32o western asceticism abbot gives him absolution and leave to join in even so on condition that he makes amends for his fault he who does not come to meals before grace is ended for all shall say grace together and pray together and all sit down together to table shall be rebuked twice for his negligence and if he does not amend he shall not be admitted to the common table but shall eat apart from the rest and his allowance of wine shall be taken from him till he has made satisfaction and mended his ways the same penalty shall be inflicted on him who is not present at the grace which is said after meals nor shall anyone presume to eat or drink but at the hour appointed but if the superior offers him something and he re fuses it he shall receive nothing whatever at the time when he does want what he first refused or indeed anything else until he has made atonement 44 how excommunicated persons are to make satisfaction he who for a great fault is suspended from oratory and table shall lie prostrate at the door of the oratory during the divine office saying nothing but lying there with his head touching the ground at the feet of everyone as they come out this he shall repeat until the abbot declares that he has made satis faction for his fault and when he is allowed by the abbot to come into the oratory he shall throw himself at the feet of the abbot and the whole community to ask their prayers then if the abbot commands he shall be received into the choir in a place appointed him but he is not to lead a psalm or read a lesson or take any other individual part in the office until further order from the abbot at the end of every office he shall prostrate himself where he stands until again the abbot judges him to have made satisfaction and bids him desist they who for lesser faults are only deprived of the table shall make satisfaction in the oratory till the abbot commands other wise they shall do it until he gives them the blessing and says it is enough 45 of those who make mistakes in the oratory if anyone while reciting a psalm responsory antiphon or lesson make a mistake unless he humble himself by making reparation before all he shall incur a greater punishment for he would not retrieve by humility what he did amiss by neglect boys for this fault shall be chastised the rule of saint benedict 32 46 of those who fail in any other matters if anyone being employed in the kitchen store refectory akehouse garden or anywhere else commits a fault breaks r loses anything or in any way fails in his duty and does not nmediately declare his fault and offer himself of his own accord d make amends before the abbot and the community when it discovered by another he shall be more severely punished but if the fault be a hidden matter concerning the soul he lall only reveal it to his abbot or spiritual elders who know ow to heal their own wounds as well as the wounds of others nd will not disclose and publish them abroad 47 of the duty of ringing for offices the abbot ought to undertake the charge of ringing to the ivinc office night and day or to entrust it to a brother who is unctual so that everything may be done at the proper times the leading of the psalms and antiphons shall be done by lose appointed thereto in their order after the abbot no one lall presume to sing or read who has not skill enough to do it tith edification it is to be done with humility and composure nd in the fear of god and by the persons whom the abbot ppoints 48 of daily labour idleness is the enemy of the soul therefore the brothers lust spend a fixed part of their time in sacred reading and nother fixed part in manual labour from easter to september i4th they shall go out and work t any necessary task from 7 a.m until 10 a.m or thereabouts rom 10 a.m until about noon they shall employ their time in sading after dinner at noon they may rest on their beds in silence f anyone would rather read a book he may provided he does ot disturb others the hour of none is to be advanced and said about 2.30 p.m nd afterwards they shall return to their work until vespers if tie circumstances or the poverty of the place require that the lonks cut their corn themselves they must not look upon it s a grievance for they are truly monks if they live by the work f their hands as our forefathers and the apostles have done eforc them yet all is to be done with moderation by reason f weak constitutions 322 western asceticism from september i4th to the beginning of lent they are to read quietly until 8 o'clock then terce shall be said and from terce to none they shall work at their appointed tasks as soon as the first bell for none goes they are to stop work and get themselves ready in time for the second bell after the meal they are to apply themselves to reading and to learning the psalms in lent they are to read from break of day until 9 a.m and then work at their different tasks until 4 p.m during lent they are each to take one book of the bible 55 and read the whole of it from beginning to end these books are to be distributed at the beginning of lent particular care should be taken that one or two of the elders be deputed to go round the monastery and oversee the monks at the times appointed for reading to discover if any of them be bored or idle or trifling away his time with frivolous talk instead of serious reading unprofitable to himself and an interruption to others if though god forbid any such person be found let him be rebuked twice if necessary and if he then does not amend he shall be punished in accord ance with the rule severely enough to make the others afraid no one shall converse with another brother at improper times on sundays all shall employ their time in reading except those who have been given special duties if there be anyone so negligent and slothful that he neither can nor will meditate or read he must be employed about some other work which he can do and must not be idle those brothers who arc sick or of tender constitutions must receive consideration from the abbot and be employed in a craft or work suitable to their strength that they may not be altogether idle nor burdened with labour beyond their powers and so driven away from the monastery 49 of the observance of lent the whole life of a monk ought to be a continual lent but because this perfection is so uncommon at least i advise every one during the holy season of lent to practise particular purity of life and redeem their negligences of other times this will be rightly performed if we control our faults and betake ourselves to prayer with tears to reading to compunction of heart and to abstinence 55 the older translations said one book from the library the latin being de bibliotheca but there is now strong evidence that bibliot ieca means bible divided into various codices gf a olivar in rev arch bibl y s 5 1949 pp 513 22 mundo in revue btntdictine i95o pp 65 92 the rule of saint benedict 323 therefore in lent everyone must of his own accord add something above his usual practice for example by offering more prayer in private by taking less than usual in food and drink so that everyone may with comfort in the holy ghost make a voluntary sacrifice to god of something beyond what is normally appointed him this means that each shall deprive his body of something in eating drinking sleeping talking and the little liberties of merriment and discourse and he is to look forward with a pure joy of spirit to the holy feast of easter each shall make known to the abbot what he is offering up and so it is to be done with the abbot's prayers and approval for what is done without the consent of him who is their spiritual father shall be looked upon as presumption and vanity and not regarded as gaining merit everything must be done with the abbot's approval 50 of brothers who work far from the oratory or who are on journeys the brothers who with the abbot's knowledge are em ployed a great way from the oratory and cannot return at the usual time for offices shall say the office at their place where they labour in the fear of god and on their knees in the same way those who are travelling shall keep the proper times for the office and discharge their duty to god as well as they can by themselves 51 of those who make short journeys the brothers who go out on any account whatever with the intention of returning the same day shall not under pain of excommunication presume to cat away from the monastery though invited to do so unless they have the abbot's leave 52 of the oratory of the monastery the oratory must be a place suited to its name and not used for any other business or purpose when the divine office is ended everyone is to go out in complete silence and reverently before god so that if a brother wants to remain for private prayer he may not be disturbed by the ill conduct of another if at any other time anyone wants to pray by himself he is to enter quietly and say his prayers not in a loud voice but in penitence and sincerity of heart except for the purpose of private prayer no one shall remain in the oratory at the end of the office lest he should as we said be a hindrance to another 324 western asceticism 53 the manner of entertaining guests all guests coming to the monastery shall be received as christ himself for he will one day say i was a stranger and you took me in 56 and everyone shall receive due honour especially clerics 57 and pilgrims as soon as he hears that a guest has arrived the superior or some of the brothers shall meet him with all the kindness that charity suggests they shall pray together and then salute each other with the kiss of peace they shall not give the kiss of peace until they have prayed to make sure that the visitor is not one of the devil's devices the salutation shall be given with deep humility whether the guests are arriving or departing it shall be with a bow or with a prostration on the ground for christ is to be adored in them and is being received as the guest after their welcome the guests are to be led to the oratory then the superior or a monk appointed by him shall sit with them he shall cause the scripture to be read before the guest for the sake of edification and afterwards shall entertain them kindly the superior shall be dispensed from fasting out of regard to the guest unless it be a particularly important fast which cannot be broken but the brother shall continue to fast as usual the abbot shall pour the water over the guest's hands and he and the community wash the feet of all the guests after they have washed them they shall say the verse lord we have received thy mercy in the midst of thy temple 58 they shall take particular care to entertain the poor and the pilgrims with more than common kindness because christ is most of all received in their persons the awe which we have of the rich makes it natural for us to honour them the kitchen that serves the abbot and the guests shall be separate from the other in this way guests who are always coming to the monastery cannot disturb the community when they arrive at irregular hours this kitchen shall be served by two brothers who take office for a year at a time and under stand the duty well they shall have assistance when they need 56 matt 25 35 37 domestici fidd some older translations wrote catholics but this is probably meaningless in the context monks is another possible meaning ps 48 9 the rule of saint benedict 325 it so that they may serve contentedly when they have little to do they shall go out to work elsewhere as they are ordered and in all other offices of the house the same consideration must be shown to furnish assistants when need requires and when there is nothing to do in their own work they shall do what is appointed elsewhere the guest room shall be entrusted to the care of a brother whose soul is possessed with the fear of god it shall contain sufficient beds decently furnished in all things the house of god is to be administered by wise men in a wise way without leave no one shall company or converse with guests but if he chances to meet and sec a guest he shall salute him humbly as i said and after asking his blessing shall pass by saying only that he is not allowed to talk with a guest 54 whether monks ought to receive letters or anything else it is not allowable for any monk without the abbot's leave to send or receive letters or presents or any little tokens from their relations or from anyone else whatsoever not even from each other and if he is sent anything by his relatives he shall not presume to accept it till he has given notice to the abbot if the abbot orders him to accept it the abbot may dispose of the thing afterwards to whom he pleases and the brother to whom it was sent shall not take it amiss or he might expose himself to the temptations of the devil whoever disobeys these regulations shall bo liable to punish ment in accordance with the rule 55 of the clothes and shoes of the brethren the brothers shall be furnished with clothes suitable to the situation and climate of the place where they live more is re quired in cold countries and less in hot this is left to the abbot's discretion for temperate climates we are of the opinion that it is enough for each monk to have a cowl the cowl for winter shall be of thicker stuff that for the summer thin and worn a tunic a belt 59 for their work shoes and stockings the monks are not to be disturbed at the colour or coarseness of these clothes but to be content with what the country pro duces and can be had cheaply the abbot shall take care that their habits be not too short but of the right size 59 the latin is scapulare for its meaning sec the convincing note by dom justin mccann pp 199 3 326 western asceticism when new clothes are given out they shall there and then restore the old ones to be laid up in the wardrobe for the poor it is enough for each to have two cowls and two tunics for change at night and for the convenience of washing more than two would be superfluous if anyone has more than two the extra should be taken away and they are to return their stockings or anything else that is old when they are given new ones those who are to make a journey shall be allowed clean drawers from the wardrobe and shall restore them washed when they return home their clothes for journeys shall be somewhat better than ordinary furnished from the wardrobe and to be restored on their return for bedding this shall be enough a mattress blanket coverlet and pillow the beds shall be frequently inspected by the abbot to see that they contain no private property if he finds anything for which he has not given leave the culprit shall be subjected to severe punishment to root this vice of private property entirely out of the monastery the abbot shall allow everything that is necessary cowl tunic stockings shoes belt knife pen needle handker chief tablets thus there will be no pretence of need yet the abbot is always to remember what is said in the acts of the apostles distribution was made to everyone according as he had need 60 and in the same way he is to consider the in firmities of the needy without having regard to the ill will or the envy of others but he must be mindful that god will deal with him according to his works 56 of the abbof stable the abbot shall always eat with guests and pilgrims when there are only a few guests he may invite whom he pleases of the brothers provided he take care to leave one or two of the elders with the community for the maintenance of discipline 57 of the craftsmen of the monastery if there are monks in the community skilled at any craft they shall work at it with humility if the abbot allows them but if anyone grows proud and values himself upon his skill and thinks himself profitable to the monastery he must be taken off his work and not allowed to practise it unless perhaps o acts 4 135 the rule of saint benedict 327 he humble himself and the abbot may think good to employ him again if any of their handiwork is to be sold let those who make the bargain take care to get no unfair advantage and remember the example of ananias and sapphira for they or any others who try to turn the common goods of the monastery to a dis honest profit would incur the death of the soul as ananias and sapphira did of the body in the price of goods they must take care to avoid avarice and must sell at a little cheaper rate than men of the world sell that in all things god may be glorified 6l 58 the manner of receiving men into the monastery when anyone presents himself to be admitted as a monk they shall not easily give him entrance but as the apostle advises make trial of the spirits to see if they are of god 62 if he is importunate and goes on knocking at the door for four or five days and patiently bears insults and rebuffs and still persists he shall be allowed to enter he shall stay in the guest room for a few days thence he shall go to the cell where the novices study and cat and sleep an elder who has the address of winning souls to god shall be appointed as the director of the novices he is to watch over them carefully and thoroughly examine whether they truly seek god whether they arc sincere in the worship of god in obedience in bearing trials the novice shall be warned of ail the hardships and difficulties on the road which leads to god if he promises to persevere in his resolution at the end of two months they shall read this rule to him from beginning to end and say to him here is the law under which you wish to be christ's soldier if you can observe it enter if you cannot freely depart if he remains firm he shall be led back to the novices cell and his patience shall be further tried at the end of six months the rule shall be read to him that he may know what he is undertaking and if he persists after four months the rule shall be read a third time and if upon matxtrc deliberation he promises to observe the whole rule and to obey whatever commands he is given he shall be admitted as a member of the community and he shall know that by the law of the rule it shall not thenceforth be in his power to quit the monastery nor to shake off the yoke of the rule which he i peter 4 11 i john 4 i 328 western asceticism might have accepted or refused during so long a time for deliberation the person to be received shall make public profession in the oratory of his stability amendment of life and obedience the promise is to be made before god and his saints so that if at any time he breaks his promise he may know that he will surely be damned by god whom he is mocking he shall write down this promise in the form of a petition in the name of the saints whose relics are there and of his own abbot he shall write it with his own hand or if he cannot write another shall do it at his instance and he shall add his mark and with his own hand lay it upon the altar as he places it on the altar he shall say this verse receive me o lord according to thy word and i shall live and let me not be disappointed of my hope 63 the whole community shall repeat this three times and end with the gloria then the novice shall throw himself at the feet of all to ask their prayers and afterwards he shall be looked upon as a member of the com munity if he has any property he shall first distribute it to the poor or make it over to the monastery by a formal donation without any reservation for himself he knows that for the future he is not even master of his own body while he is still in the oratory his own clothes shall be re moved and he shall be clad in the clothes of the monastery but his clothes shall be kept in the wardrobe so that if ever god forbid he should be enticed by the devil and consent to leave the monastery he can be stripped of his habit and turned out his petition which the abbot took from off the altar is not to be returned to him but preserved in the monastery 59 of the sons of rich and poor offered to god in the monastery if a nobleman makes an offer of his son to god in the monastery and the boy is young his parents shall write the petition as before and making a gift to the monastery 64 they shall wrap the child's hand and their petition iix the altar cloth and so deliver him to god ps 119 116 4 cum oblatione the difficulty of this interpretation is the final sentence of the chapter where the destitute are also supposed to make a gift never theless it still seems the most probable meaning in the context another suggestion is at the offertory in the mass the rule of saint benedict 329 as regards their property they must promise under oath in their petition that neither they nor their agent nor any other person will ever give any piece of private property to him or even give him the opportunity of acquiring it but if they want to give alms to the monastery for their own merit before god they may make a conveyance of what they please to the monastery and if they wish reserve the income to themselves in this way there will be no breach open whereby the boy which god forbid may look forward to owning property and so be drawn into ruin as i have known happen the poorer shall do the same those who have nothing at all shall simply make the petition and with an offering tender their boy in the presence of witnesses 60 of priests who may wish to live in the monastery if a priest asks to be received into the monastery his request shall not be allowed without due consideration but if he persists in his petition he is to know that he must keep the whole rule he shall be exempted in nothing and so will better answer the question friend why earnest thou hither 6s notwithstanding he may take place after the abbot give blessings conduct services if the abbot so ordains otherwise he is not to undertake anything whatever he is to remember that he is bound to observe discipline according to the rule and is particularly to give a good example of humility if there is a question of order or any other matter to be settled in the monastery he must expect to be in the place which is his due according to the time when he entered the monastery and not the place which is granted him out of respect to his priestly office if any other ecclesiastic has the same desire to join the com munity he shall be allowed a moderate place provided that he makes a promise to keep the rule and to persevere 6 1 how pilgrim monks are to be received if a pilgrim monk arrives from a distant country and wants to live as a guest in the monastery and is content to submit to the ways of the place as he finds them without troubling the house by demanding more than is customary he may be admitted for as long as he pleases if he reasonably and humbly and charitably represents that something is wrong and should be redressed the abbot shall 26 50 33o western asceticism maturely deliberate upon it and consider whether god did not send him there for that intent if afterwards he wishes to remain there he is not to be re fused for while he was a guest they have had an opportunity of seeing his way of living but if they have remarked anything disorderly or vicious so far from admitting him to the com munity they shall politely desire him to depart for fear that others will be misled by his bad example if on the contrary he does not deserve to be sent away not only shall he be admitted to the community if he requests it they shall invite him to stay and teach the others by his ex ample wherever we are we serve one lord fight under one sovereign if the abbot finds that he deserves to be advanced he may give him a higher place in the community the abbot may also do this with priests and ecclesiastics as above provided he sees that their good life deserves that consideration but the abbot is to take care that he does not admit to his monastery any monk of a known monastery without the consent of his abbot or credentials from him for it is written do not to another as you would not have done to yourself 66 62 of the priests of the monastery if an abbot wants to advance any of his monks to the order of priest or deacon he shall make choice of persons worthy of the office the person ordained must be careful to avoid vanity or arrogance and not to take upon him anything that the abbot does not command he is to remember that he has only a greater obligation to keep discipline according to the rule because he is a priest he is not to forget obedience to the rule and good order but is to advance more and more on the way to god he must always expect to have his seniority from the day of his entry into the monastery and not that which belongs to the service of the altar even if the community and the abbot want to promote him in consideration of his good life he is neverthe less to understand that he must keep the rule appointed for deans and priors if he acts otherwise he shall not be looked upon as a priest but as a rebel if after frequent rebukes he does not amend the bishop shall be brought in to see his faults if not even then does he amend and his faults are manifest he shall be dismissed from the tf tobit 4 15 the rule of saint benedict 33 monastery yet his disobedience must be refusal to obey the rule 63 the order of precedence in the community their places in the monastery shall be determined by their time of entry the goodness of their life and the decision of the abbot the abbot is not to disturb his flock which is a trust by using an arbitrary power to do anyone an injury but must ever remember that he is to give account to god of his decisions and actions according to the precedence which he has determined or which they observe amongst themselves they shall go to the kiss of peace receive the holy communion lead the psalms and take their place in the choir wherever they are age shall be neither here nor there in determining precedences for samuel and daniel though but children were made judges of elders all except those whom for particular reasons the abbot has degraded or advanced shall take their place according to their date of entry into the community for example he who comes to the monastery at 8 o'clock shall know that he is junior to him who came at 7 o'clock whatever his age and rank but boys arc to be kept under discipline to everyone the junior monks are to honour the seniors and the seniors to love the juniors in talking to one another no one may call another by his own name but the seniors shall call the juniors brothers and the juniors shall call the seniors reverend fathers and because the abbot is esteemed to be in the place of christ he shall be called lord and abbot not as his own due but out of honour and love to christ the abbot ought to reflect and behave in a manner worthy of so great an honour wherever the brothers meet the junior shall ask the senior's blessing when the senior passes by the younger shall rise to give up his scat and he shall not presume to sit down again till he is bidden by the senior according to the words of scrip ture in honour preferring one another 67 little children and boys shall keep their regular places in the oratory or at meals elsewhere they shall be supervised and under discipline until they come to years of discretion 64 of the abbofs election in the election of the abbot they shall observe this method that person shall be constituted and received abbot whom the whole community has unanimously elected in the fear of 7 rom 13 10 332 western asceticism god or whom a part of the community though a minority has chosen with greater prudence the person to be appointed is to be chosen for the goodness of his life and the excellence of his wisdom even though he be the last in the house according to seniority if it should happen god forbid that the whole congregation should unanimously conspire to elect a person to support them in their ill practices and their disorder grow notorious to the bishop of that diocese or to the abbots or other christians of the neighbourhood they are to prevent the success of the con spiracy and appoint an abbot who will be a faithful steward over the house of god they shall be assured of a good reward if they do it with pure motives and zeal for god and that they will be guilty of sin if they neglect to interfere in these circum stances the person elected must reflect how weighty a burden he undertakes and who will demand an account of his administra tion he must remember that he is more obliged to profit his flock than to preside over them he is to be well versed in holy scripture so as to know how to bring forth from his treasure things new and old he is to be chaste sober and merciful he is ever to put mercy above justice 6s that he may himself deserve mercy at the hand of god he must hate sin and love the brothers and when he is forced to punish them he must use all discretion and modera tion and so will not shatter the vessel by trying to scour it too clean he must be aware of his own frailty and remember that it is forbidden to break the already bruised reed 69 we do not mean that he should countenance the growth of vice but that he use discretion and tenderness as he sees it expedient for the different characters of his brothers he is to endeavour much more to be loved than feared he must observe a calmness in his ways and not be uneasy nor overmuch wedded to his own notions not jealous nor too suspicious for then he will never be free of worry he must be cautious and circumspect in his commands and he is to exam ine his commands to see whether they are in accordance with god's will or arise from worldly motives and is to use restraint remembering the discretion of jacob if i make my flocks go further they will all die in one day discretion is the mother of virtues he must follow the example of jacob and others and m gf james 2 13 gf isa 42 13 matt 12 20 70 gen 33 13 it is possible that the sentence means he is to use discretion the rule of saint benedict 333 so adjust his measures that the strong may be led to press on ward and the weak may not be disheartened above all he is to observe this rule in every point so that when he has faith fully discharged his duty he may hear from the mouth of the lord the words said to the good servant who gave his fellow servants wheat in due season verily i say unto you he will set him over all his goods 71 65 of the prior of the monastery the appointment of the prior frequently causes great dis orders in monasteries there are some people who succumb to a wicked spirit of ambition look upon themselves as a second abbot and usurp a dictatorial authority hence breed scandals and factions in a community this happens especially in com munities where the prior is appointed by the same bishop or the same neighbouring abbots who appoint the abbot it is easy to see how absurd this system is for the method of his appointment gives him occasion to grow proud from the moment he takes office since it suggests to him temptingly that he is exempt from the abbot's authority for he says to himself you and the abbot derived your authority from the same people so arise animosities quarrels detraction jealousy dissension disorder while the abbot and the prior are at vari ance their souls must needs be exposed to danger and the monks who become partisans and flatterers of the one side or the other promote their own ruin but the originators of the faction are chiefly responsible for the danger into which everyone is running therefore i have thought it expedient for the keeping of peace and charity that the abbot should control the appoint ment to every office in his monastery if possible he shall make use of deans to administer the monastery as he shall direct if there arc many commanders no one will grow arrogant but if the circumstances of the place require it or the whether his commands concern spiritual matters or temporal matters but i think this is an improbable use of the phrase secwidum saeculum saeculum is used with a bad meaning in the rule chapters i servants saeculofidem 4 saecuti actibus sefacere alienum the use in 7 scala est vita in scuculo is probably but not quite certainly neutral i do not think benedict would have conceived of secular actions in the mon astery as opposed to spiritual actions see especially his instructions that all the common goods of the monastery are to be treated like the vessels upon the altar 7i matt 24 47 western asceticism amunity requests humbly and reasonably that a prior be ointed and if the abbot judges it to be expedient then the ot is himself to appoint a prior choosing the person himself t

souls wish this rule to be read often in the community then no her can excuse himself upon the score of ignorance 72 67 of brethren sent on journeys onks who are to be sent on a journey shall commend oselves to the prayers of the community and of the abbot iis was almost certainly the end of an earlier draft of the rule the needing chapters have nothing to correspond with them in regula zgistri the rule of saint benedict 335 absent monks shall be always commemorated at the end of the divine office the day they return home they shall lie prostrate on the floor of the oratory at the end of all the offices and ask the com munity's prayers that god will please to forgive the faults which they may have been surprised into committing on their journey through sight or hearing of evil or through idle talk no one shall presume under pain of punishment according to the rule to relate what has happened to him outside the monastery for this may occasion many evil consequences the same penalty shall be incurred by him who presumes to leave the cloister and go anywhere at all or do anything however unimportant without the abbot's leave 68 if a brother be ordered to do something impossible if a brother is ordered to do something difficult or impossible he shall receive the order with good temper and submission if he sees that it is altogether beyond his power he may patiently wait an opportunity to show his superior why it is impossible provided he do it in a humble and not in a rebellious spirit if notwithstanding his plea the superior persists in the order the brother is to be persuaded that it is for his good and in charity trusting in god's help shall obey 69 that no one in the community ought to defend another great care is to be taken that no monk presume to defend or protect another even though they be kinsmen great scan dak can ensue if any be found guilty on this point he shall be severely punished 70 that no one shall strike another irregularly to take away all occasion of presumption in the monastery we order that no one at any time shall presume to excom municate or strike another unless he have the abbot's authority let offenders be publicly rebuked as a fearful example to others 73 but everyone shall have a hand in the education and discip line of children up to the age of fifteen yet they are to be dealt with reasonably and with restraint anyone who exercises discipline upon those older than fifteen without the abbot's leave and anyone who is heated with the children and does not 73 1 tim 5 20 336 western asceticism control himself shall be punished according to the rule it is written do not to another what you would not have done to yourself 4 71 that the brothers are to be obedient to each other obedience of its own nature is a thing so good that they are to pay it to each other as well as the abbot being assured that by this way of obedience they will come to god leaving aside the commands of the abbot or the priors appointed by him which take precedence of all private instructions we declare that the junior are to obey the senior with readiness and charity if anyone makes trouble he is to be corrected if a brother for whatever reason trivial though it be is rebuked by the abbot or by one of his seniors even if he is conscious that his senior is offended or moved at him however mildly he shall on the spot throw himself at the feet of the senior and remain there by way of satisfaction until the vexation be gone and he receive the senior's blessing if anyone scorns to do this he shall be liable to corporal punishment if he is obstinate he shall be expelled from the monastery 72 of the right jealousy which monks ought to ham there is a bitter and wicked jealousy which separates from god and leads towards hell but there is a rightful jealousy which separates from sin and leads towards heaven and eternal life this is the jealousy monks ought to practise from motives of charity namely to prefer one another in honour 75 they are to bear with patience the weaknesses of others whether of body or behaviour and strive with each other in being obedient they shall not follow their own good but rather the good of their brothers they shall be charitable with a pure heart towards their brothers they shall fear god they shall love their abbot with a sincere and humble affection they are to put nothing at all before christ whom we pray to lead us together to eternal life 73 that this rule does not contain the whole law of righteousness i have written this rule with the object of showing that monks who keep it have at least something of virtuous charac ter and must have begun to live a truly good life but men aspire to the perfect life and for them there are the teachings of the holy fathers which will lead those who follow them to 74 tobit 4 15 75 r o m 12 10 the rule of saint benedict 337 true perfection what page even sentence of the inspired old and new testaments is there that is not an excellent rule of life what book of the holy catholic fathers is there that does not point out the nearest way to come to our creator the conferences of the fathers their institutes and lives the rule of our father saint basil these are instruments to help the monk who follows them to lead a good life to us idle and neglectful sinners they are a reproach and shame whoever you are who desire to advance apace to the heavenly country practise first through christ's help this little rule for beginners and in the end under god's protection you will climb those greater heights of knowledge and virtue to which the holy fathers beckon you appendix notes to the sayings of the fathers the text as is explained in the introduction this is not intended to be a full apparatus but is intended to secure so far as is possible in the present state of knowledge that the translation represents the text as it was in the sixth and seventh centuries and not the text as it became established in later medieval tradition the following manuscripts with their abbreviations here used have been of service b brussels bibliotheque royale 1221 9850 2 fol 5 107 this manuscript came almost certainly from the

one time in the library of the bollandists g cologne chapter library 165 the manuscript is a semi uncial which has been dated in the sixth or seventh century i incline to think that this dating is too early and that the early eighth century is more probable but the manuscript is in any case an early authority of importance in some scribbling on the last folio occurs the name hilduinus episcopus
