EXERCISE  10. 

This  exercise  contains  examples  of 
aspirated  letters  nearly  silent  in  the 
body  of  words.  In  some  words  -6  and 
5  are  merely  inserted  to  make  a  sec- 
ond syllable  and  to  prevent  a  hiatus, 
as  no  number  of  vowels  meeting  in  a 
word  can  form  more  than  one  syllable. 
This  insertion  of  adventitious  letters 
is  frequently  used  in  the  inflection  of 
words.

,f3>5  the  Editor  of  the  Gael  : 
.(P,,;/i!-,.  Dear  Sir, —  My  object  in  writing  the  following    composition 

jj   -ibas  been  to  divorce  one  of  our  most  beautiful  and  attractive  Irish 
*,.j[  airs  from  an  improper,  unsuitable  connection,  to  which  it  had  been 
.;,.;  wedded,  in  days  past,  by  some  obscure,  vulgar  poetaster,  who    had 
fi,,,'  no  due  appreciation  of  its  merits.     I  am  well  aware  that  the  Cuc- 
koo builds  no  nest  of  its  own  but  appropriates  that  of  another  bird  ; 
and  hence  the  production  has  no  actual  basis  of  reality  for  its  foun- 
dation :  but  must  be  accredited  to  the  whimsical  fancy  and  creative 
imagination  of  its  hamblti  author.     Professor  O'Curry,  in  his  works 
on  the  "Manners  and  Customs  of  the  Ancient  Irish  "has  slated  that 
some  of  our  melodious,  popular  Gaelic  airs  reach  back  for  their  ori- 
gin to  a  date  anterior  to  the  beginninfr  ot  the  Christian  era  :  and 
hence  the  proprietj^  of  their  preservation  must  appear    obvious  to 
,  the  true  Irish  patriot  who  feels  zealous  for  the  traditionary  honor 
of  his  enlightened  ancestors.  W.    Russell.

One  morning  as  I  rambled  nigli,  a  streamlet's  margin  brambled  by 

A  blooming  brake,  that  flourished  in  a  grove's  lonely  shade  ;[Spring, 

Where  the  nightingale  was  wont  to  smg  the  lay  of  blossom-bearing 

And  the  mellow-throated  thrush's  note  made  vocal  the  glade— 
As  boyhood's  guileless  innocence  was  fairly    my  own — 

Ere  age  the  tares  of  sorrow  in  my  life's  field  had  sown —  (quest, 
Deep  was  the  joy  that  thrilled  my  breast,  on  finding  to  reward  my 

Siife,  sheltered  in  a  "sally"  a  sweei  Cuckoo's  Nest. 

Now  while  no  breeze  could  harm  it,  with  fleecy  down  to  warm  it 

The  bird  with  rarest  instinct  had  incased  it  around —  (hair  — 
Both  wool  and  fur  the  structure  fair  displayed—  inwoven  well  with 

Whde  plumes  of  snowy  turt'es  too,  the  fairy-gem  crowned  : 
To  rob  it  were  a  Vandal's  act  my  mind  could  not  bear, 

1  left  it  there  with  brood  intact,  as  free  as  the  air — 
And  while  my  feet  but  barely  prest  a  plain  arrayed  in  daisy-vest,  " 

I  quickly  homeward  hurried  irom  the  Cuckoo's  Nest.  ■  •■  •"  '' 

As  keeps  a  saint  a  sacred  vow,  concealed  I  kept  my  secret  now,,,,,, ,.  ,  -■ 

Lest  as  the  north.blast,  blightful,  bares  a  blown  bough  of  blopm/  ,. ' 
The  hand  of  some  predaceos  elf— intent  to  revel  in  its  pelf—     ,,,  .,  y  -j  ;  ■ 

The  May  bird's  cosy,  curtained,  couch  to  ruin  mij^ht  doom  ^,M/r,-J  -.jo 
It  was  visited  at  morning,  noon,  and  ere  the  fall  of  night — 

I  saw  it  too  in  visions  clear  by  slumber's  dreamy  light ;  '>oi  It'  /""> 
For  of  all  the  earthly  treasures,  with  which  human  life  is  bleát^^n  fitr.JS- 

The  full  measure  of  my  pleasure  was  the  Cuckoo's  Nest.       i'>i>Ts  \\/.h' 

Now  grown  more  sage  by  age,  insooth,  I  own  the  error  of  my  youth, 

That  could  so  much  affection,  and  so  vainly  bestow —  '  ' 

Yet,  folly  even  haunts  me  now,  while  at  another  shrine  I  bow, 

Where  destiny's  force  urges  me  restraint  to  forego  : 
And  it  is  not  love  of  riches  that  inspires  me,  I  own,  ' 

Nor  of  fame,  to  make  my  memory  to  future  times  known ; 
But  'tis  woman — lovely  woman,  like  a  iairy-sylph  drest 

That  replaces  in  my  bosom's  core  the  Cuckoo's  Nest.

SWEET  OOOLNABIN. 

I  wish  I  was  in  Mamma- gara, 
Or  round  the  borders  of  that  lovely  glen  ; 

And  I  possessed  of  the  wit  of  Homer, 
Ink  and  paper  and  a  well-made  pen. 

Night  and  morning  it  would  be  my  labor 
To  sound  itá  praises  with  my  slender  quill  ; 

There  is  no  residence  throughout  this  Nation, 
Can  in  beauty  equal  sweet  Ooolnabin. 

In  this  lovely  valley  there  is  wood  and  water 
Dispensing  their  beauty  to  that  lovely  glen, 

The  small  fish  rolling  and  salmon  trowling, 
Along  the  borders  of  each  purling  stream  ; 

There' is  no  heat  here  like  on  other  mountains, 
Oar  hills  are  covered  with  verdant  hue, 

The  fox  and  eagle,  the  plover  and  grouse. 
In  time  of  fowling  are  still  in  view. 

There  is  a  lake  here  of  great  admiration 
Where  swans  are  bathing  on  each  purling  rill. 

And  he  that  lived  here  and  must  forsake  it  ; 
Who  could  blame  him  to  cry  his  fill  ? 

If  for  me,  'twas  predestinated. 
In  distant  places  some  time  to  dwel', 

le  gods  take  pity  on  my  desolation, 
In  lamentation  behind  the  hills. 

And  he  who  traveled  our  Irish  nation, 
Each  port  and  harbor  doth  tell  to  me  ; 

England,  Scotland,  have  searched  according, 
France,  and  Spain,  and  fair  Germany — 

Traveled  Europe  in  every  station, 
His  a  vocation  been  traveling  still. 

In  all  his  ranging  and  serenading, 
Could  find  none  to  equal  sweet  Ooolnabin. 

If  my  fellow  play-boys  at  the  foot  of  Nephm 
Knew  of  my  dcbolation  and  me  far  from  home, 

Iq  a  camp  wheeled  carriage  they  would  carry  me 
To  my  native  place  my  life  to  restore 

In  their  arms  ihey  would  embrace  me, 
And  recreate  me  with  heart  and  will — 

Here  I'd  recover  from  all  diseases. 
And  bid  farewell  to  the  Sliave-Morehill. 

I  have  a  letter  now  penmd  to  paper. 
Signed  and  sealed  for  to  send  with  speed. 

To  tell  my  fellow  play-boys  ot  the  foot  of  Nephin, 
That  I'll  soon  be  deceased  here  uuless  relieved  ; 

I'll  be  placed  in  a  dark  sepulchre, 
W  ithout  a  female  to  shed  a  tear, 

Like  brave  Prograner  born  to  Celestial  regions 
Not  well  knowing  where  to  steer. 

fcilave-Morehill  I  fain  would  leave  you. 
Where  I  found  the  neighbors  both  kind  and  free. 

With  hospitality  they  did  receive  me 
When  from  my  own  place  I  was  forced  to  flee  ; 

Like  the  salmon  fry  that  comes  by  nature. 
After  ranging  the  ocean  wide 

It  is  so  by  me  if  I'd  traverse  this  nation, 
At  the  foot  of  Naphin  I'd  wish  to  die.

A  story  of  Ireland  of  our  day,  by  O'Donovarl 
Rossa,  S.  W.  Green's  Ssn  69  Biekman  st.  N.  V., 
publisher. 

The  above  is  one  of  the  most  interesting  novels 
we  have  read  in  a  long  time.  It  vividly  places  b*  - 
fore  the  reader's  mind  the  thrilling  incidents  borne 
of  the  unnatural  relations  which  unfortunately  ex- 
ist between  the  governing  and  governed  classes  of 
society  in  Ireland.  We  prophecy  for  the  bool<  a 
large  circulation. 

It  may  interest  some  of  our  Pennsylvania  readers 
to  know  that  Mr.  J.  J.  Jourdan,  publisher  of  that 
really  spicy  journal,  The  Truth,  Scrauton,  is  a  v.-ry 
enthusiastic  student  of  the  Irish  Language.

Song, — By  Chraoibhin  Aoibhinn. 

We'll  raise  up,  we'll  lift  up, 
Our  hearts  and  our  song; 

Our  praises  we'll  oifer 
Jehovah  the  strong  ! 

With  spirits  rejoicing, 

We'll  thank  the  good  king; 

For  ever  unceasing, 
His  glory  we'll  sing. 

The  demon  of  evil 

We'll  cast  from  our  mind;— 
His  fetters  we'll  shatter 

And  iiing  them  behind. 

We'll  banish  the  tempters 
That  wrought  our  downfall  ; 

And  honor  we'll  render 
To  God  above  all. 

Oh,  Prince  of  all  princes  ! 

Behold  from  your  throne 
Poor  Erin  in  torture, — 

Oh,  list  to  her  moan  I 

Crush  down  without  mercy 
The  foes  of  the  Gael  ; 

And  raise  in  her  splendor 
Our  loved  Innisfail  ! 

Then  iree  hearts  we'll  raise  up 

To  Him  we  adore 
We'll  praise  and  give  glory 

To  God  evermore !

THE  NATIONAL  LANGUAGE  AND  'IHE  NA- 
TIONAL   BOARD. 

TO  THE   EDITOR   OF   THE   FREEMAN.' 

St.  Theresa's,  Clarendon  st.,  Dublin, 
March  3rd 

Sir — Far  better  an  open  enemy  than  a  concealed 
foe,-  The  Board  of  National  Education  has  been 
too  long  the  concealed  foe  ;  but  we,  the  Gaelic  Uu 
ion,  have  forced  it  into  th'e  position  of  declaring 
itself  the  open  enemy  of  the  Irish  language.  Opin- 
ions were  very  much  divided  on  the  prudence  or 
the  policy  of  the  Gaelic  Union  "going  to  the  Cas- 
tle" to  lay  a  statement  before  the  Chief  Secretary 
with  regard  to  the  position  of  the  Irish  language 
in  the  National  schools.  Too  late  now  to  discuss 
our  action  of  six  month's  ago,  but  not  too  late  to 
say  that  we  have  gained  one  of  the  objects  in  view, 
and  that  is  the  forcing  of  the  enemy  into  the  open 
field.  In  the  answer  to  our  memorial  we  have 
sufficient  material  to  show  that  the  nicknamed  Na 
tional  school  has  been  the  grave  of  the  National 
language  ;  that  the  teachers  in  those  schools  have 
not  only  scourged  out  the  language,  but  created  a 
bind -eon  police  among  the  ignorent  parents,  so  un- 
natural as  to  spy  upoQ  and  betray  their  own  chil- 
dren. "We  have  enough  to  prove  that  if  "the  Don- 
egal of  1884  is  not  the  Donegal  of  1853,"  we  have 
also  enough  to  prove  that  iatrick  Keenan,  Head 
Inspector  of  1853,  is  not  the  vSir  Patrick  Keenau, 
Resident  Commissioner  of  1884.  And  soon,  we 
hope,  abundant  information  will  be  forthcoming 
from  our  country  districts  to  put  in  evidence  against 
Sir  Patrick's  statement  when  he  says  . — 

The  Donegal  of  to-day  is  entirely  different  from 
the  Donegal  of  1855.  There  is  now  no  parallel  be- 
tween Malta  and  any  of  the  districts  of  Donegal  or, 
indeed,  of  any  part  of  Ireland. 

Now,  Mr,  Enitor,  if  the  Irish  lauguage  is  to  be 
saved  at  all,  it  cannot  be  done  by  letters  and  articles 
in  newspapers  alone,  by  talking  about  the  glories 
of  its  past,  or  by  theorising  about  its  beauties. 
There  must  be  action,  united  and  determined. 
And  very  soon  a  tangible  opportunity  will  be  given 
the  country  of  throwing  off  the  insult  now  cast  up- 
on them  by  the  Commissioners,  and  declaring  once 
and  forever  whether  the  Irish  language  is  to  live  or 
die.  Until  /  founded  in  1876  a  society  which  has 
passed  its  zenith,  only  intermittent  and  spasmodic 
efforts,  were  made  to  save  the  language  ;  but  since 
that  date  remarkable  and  unprecedented  successes 
have  followed  in  my  track.  The  chmax  is  now 
reached,  not  of  success,  but  of  tiial.  If  the  com- 
parison be  allowed,  the  foes  have  taken  the  field. 
On  one  side  is  the  Gaelic  nion,  with  a  few  unpaid 
officers,  without  men,  without  money  ;  on  the  other 
side  is  this  Board,  with  its  heavy  salaried  oflicers, 
armies  of  ofiicials,  and  gigantic,  although  compar- 
atively worthless,  working  machinery.  Atprese  t 
the  contest  is  unequal,  but  the  Gaelic  Union  hopes 
to  be  supplied  by  Ireland  with  the  sinews  of  war 
as  well  as  with  willing  recruits,  both  in  officers  and 
men. 

As  soon  as  I  have  cleared  away  a  lot  of  heavy 
work  at  present  pressing  on  my  shoulders,  I  shall 
arrange  to  have  a  representative  meeting  here  in 
Dublin  to  test  educated  public  opinion  as  to  what 
is  to  be  done — whether  we  are  to  quietly  surren- 
der to  the  Board  or  to  continue  our  labors  to  pre 
serve  the  National  tongue.  As  noticed  in  your 
leader  of  this  day'sissue,  it  is  but  25year8  agonow 
since  the  English  was  known  by  the  peasantry  in 
some  districts  as  the '  'new  language. "  Twenty-  five 
years  hence  the  National  Board  will  if  allowed, 
leave  us  without  a  solitary  parish  speaking  the  Cel- 


tic of  our  fathers.  However,  if  it  be  the  will  of  the 
Irish  people  that  their  ancient  language  is  to  live 
the  Gaelic  Union  most  certain'y  will  continue  to 
prosecute  their  efforts  in  that  direction.

RESPECTABLE     AMERICANS— TO     WHOM 
DOES  THE  TITLE  PROPERLY  BELONG. 

The  Gael  having  for  its  object  the  cultivation  of 
the  language  and  literature  of  Ireland  and  through 
it  the  social  elevation  of  the  Irish  people — or  more 
properly,  their  defense  from  the  aspersions  soixghc 
to  be  cast  on  them  by  the  subsidized  agents  of 
England  so  as  to  justify  that  power  in  keeping 
them  in  bondage,  we  shall  not  cease  to  strike  back 
whenever  any  party  by  declaration  or  innuendo 
seeks  to  reflect  oa  our  nationality.  Under  oi-dinary 
circumstances,  and  before  an  unprejudiced,  enlight- 
ened public,  the  social  and  intellectual  status  of 
the  Irish,  as  a  people,  need  no  defense.  But,  in 
stead,  we  have  to  meet  extraordinary  circumstan- 
ces and  unmitigated  far  reaching  prejudice. — Ex- 
traordinary crircumstances  in  the  fact  that  Irishmen 
themselves,  by  ignoring  the  language  and  literature 
of  their  country,  (which  are  the  only  evidences  any 
people  can  produce  to  show  the  civilization  of  their 
forefathers)  assist  the  enemies  of  their  race  and  na 
tion  in  placing  them  before  the  world  as  a  tribe 
devoid  of  aTitecedents  and  respectability,  and,  there- 
fore, unfit  to  govern  themselves. 

Herein  lies  the  secret  of  Ireland's  degradation 
as  a  nation,  and  the  Irishman  who  neglects  to  cul- 
tivate the  language  and  literature  of  his  country, 
and  says,  "What  good  is  it",  conduces  to  that  deg- 
radation. He  is  a  greater  enemy  to  his  country 
than  the  most  rabid  Englishman,  because  he  shows 
the  world  by  his  acts  that  Ireland  never  possessed 
anything,  in  his  opinion,  worth  preserving — for  a 
man's  actions  are  the  reflex,  of  his  mind.  These,  we 
call  extraordinary  circumstances. 

Unmitigated  and  far-reaching  prejudice  in  the 
fact  that  the  atmosphere  in  which  we  move  has 
been  impregnated  with  inveterate  hostility  to  our 
race,  intensified  by  religious  fanaticism  and  the 
fear  always  present  to  the  oppressor  that  the  op- 
pressed might  someday  be  in  a  position  to  retali- 
ate for  his  misdeeds.  The  wealth  and  ÍLifiuenceof 
England  have  been  freely  lavished  to  compass  this 
end,  and  educated  Irishmen,  as  above  remarked, 
abet  in  its  furtherance.  Unthinkingly  and  unin- 
tentionally they  assist  in  riveting  the  chains  which 
keep  them  in  slavery. 

Take  up  the  public  press  of  the  country — even 
that  portion  of  it  that  has  been  nurtured  into  man- 
hood by  Irishmen — and  the  venomous  hiss  of  the 
snake  becomes  audible.  Yet.  Irishmen  continue 
to  support  such  journals  '  This  fact  we  also  call 
extraordinary. 

These  remarks  are  called  forth  by  the 
attitude  of  certain  j  jurnals,  principally  support- 
ed by  Irishmen,  towards  some  Irish- American  re- 
publican politicians  of  New  York  City.  It  is  not 
our  purpose  to  dilate  on  the  merits  or  demerits  of 
the  parties  under  consideration,  individually,  but 
when  they  are  being  employed  as  levers  to  re- 
flect on  our  nationality,  we  certainly  feel  justified 


in  instituting  what  we  think  wil  be  a  telling  com- 
parison. J. 

The  Irish- Americans  to  «shall  we  alluded  above 
are  John  J.  O'Brien,  Miehael  Creagan,  and  Ber- 
nard Biglin,  &c. ,  and  Our  objection  to  the  action 
of  the  press  in  criticising  them  is  that  their  names, 
or  that  part  of  them  which  assuredly  indicates 
their  nationality,  has  been  apostrophied,  with  a 
view  of  exciting  and  perpetuating  National  preju- 
dice in  the  pro-English  portion  of  our  fellow  citi- 
zens. Thus— "Johnny  O'Brien",  '♦Mike"  Creagan 
"Barnej  "  Biglin  &c.  &c.  It  would  be  insulting  the 
reader's  intelligence  to  suggest  the  object  sought 
to  be  gained  by  such  characterization.  We  are 
surprised  that  they  did  not  try  to  include  some 
"Pat"  in  the  group — it  hardly  looks  finished  with- 
out it.  But,  oh  !  we  foryot.  A  scion  of  English 
Eoyalty  is  called  "Pat",  Prince  Patrick,  Duke  of 
Connaught,  and,  for  the  world, our  respectable  Am 
ericans,  who  would  bow  to  the  shadow  of  royalty, 
would  not  insult  that  name.  "Mike"  being  a  name 
in  the  royal  family  of  Russia  and  Austria  is  of  no 
consequence,  tho'  if  Prince  Michael,  brother  to  the 
Czar  of  Russia,  were  jwarching  down  Broadway  to- 
morrow, our  shoddy  respectables  would  bow  to 
his  shadow. 

A  handful  of  our  citizens  claim  to  own  this  coun- 
try and  to  shape  its  destinies,  and,  singular  to  re- 
late, they  are  the  descendants  of  those  who  sided 
with  England  against  Washington  and  the  patriot- 
ic party  during  the  Revolutionary  war — the  'i'ories. 
They  are  English  today  to  the  back-bone,  and 
through  her  money  and  her  influence  they  are  able 
to  shape  the  government  of  the  country  in  Eng- 
land's interest.  They,  through  the  same  means, 
hive  controlled  the  press  of  the  country  which 
keeps  them  before  the  public  as  "the  respectable 
Americans".  This  handful  of  citizens  is  what  is 
commonly.known  as  the  New  England  element. 
They  are  not  5  per  cent  of  the  population  and  yet 
they  shape  the  laws,  to  the  discredit,  we  think, 
and  to  the  danger  of  the  liberties  of  the  great  mass 
of  the  people.  This  right  to  own  and  to  govern 
the  country  and  to  arrogate  to  themselves  the  title 
exclusively,  to  American  respectability,  they  claim 
by  virtue  of  being  the  direct  descendants  of  the  or- 
iginal English  settlers.  Now— we  shall  institute 
a  comparisou  between  them  ,p,nd  the  "Johnny 
O'Briens",  the  "Mikes",  and  the  "Birneys",  and 
we  shall  let  the  reader  judge  which  party,  by  right, 
should  be  adj  udged  respectable.  The  items  which 
we  shall  produce  in  support  of  our  demonstration 
will  be  taken  fro OQ  their  ow  i  historian  (Anderson). 

The  Spaniards  and  the  French  were  the  first  set- 
tlers of  America.  The  Spaniards  settled  in  Flor- 
ida, Texas,  and  the  southern  part  of  the  country. 
The  French  settled  in  Canada,  Nova  Scotia,  Caro- 
lina, Louisiana,  cVc.  128  years  after  the  discovery 
of  America  by  the  Spaniards,  and  its  partial  set- 
tlement by  themselves  and  the  French,  a  colony

from  Eugland,  the  Paritaas,  to  the  number  of  102 
lauded  from  the  MajHower,  at  Plymouth  Kock, 
Dec.  21,  1620.  0  "'  *■  iporaneously  with  the  land- 
ing of  the  Pilgrims,  fitiother  batch  of  persons  were 
sent  out  from  England  to  Virginia,  where  a  small 
settlement  had  been  previously  made  by  the 
London  Company.  This  batch  consit^ied  of  100 
women  who  were  sent  out  to  become  wives  to  the 
planters,  each  planter  paying  120  pounds  of  tobac- 
co as  a  price  for  his  wife.-  -her  passage  money. 

The  reader  will  undoubtedly  conjecture 
what  class  of  women  could  be  bought  for  120  lbs. 
of  tobacco,  and  the  class  of  men  that  would  take 
them  as  wives.  These  then,  with  the  convicts 
who  served  their  terms  of  penal  servitude  in  Ne.v- 
foundland  were  really  the  first  English  settlers  in 
the  country—  and  these  were  the  forefathers  and 
foremothers  of  those  who  would  now  atr  gate  to 
themselves  the  title  of  nspectah  e  Amer  cins  !  The 
"Johnny  O'Briens",  were  then  of  royal  blood,  as 
they  should  be  today  if  right  prevailed. 

We  regret  exoeediogly  to  be  obliged  to  rake  up 
these  matters,  but  we  were  forced  to  it  in  defense 
of  our  countrymen  and  of  truth  and  justice. 

The  most  respectable  portion  of  our  fellow-citi- 
zens are  those,  and  their  descendants,  who  have 
come  to  the  country  within  the  last  sixty  years. 
Educated  Irishmen  are  coming  to  this  country  of 
late  years  to  avail  themselves  of  business  oppor- 
tunities which  alien  misgovernment  denies  them 
at  home,  and,  certainly,  they  should  not  tamely 
submit  to  be  insulted  by  the  descendants  of  the 
class  which  we  have  analyzed  above — even  though 
they  have  the  monetary  power  of  E  igland  at  their 
control,  and  tho'  England  pats  them  on  the  back 
through  interested  motives,  yet  she  despises  their 
social  pretensions,  because  she  knows  from  whom 
they  have  sprung. 

We  indicated  in  our  last  the  antecedents  of  the 
Vanderbilts  and  Astors,  and  hope  we  shall  not  be 
forced  to  refer  to  the  (to  us)  ugly  sub  ect  again. 

We  claim  to  have  impartially  presented  this 
matter  to  our  readers,  and  those  whom  it  affects 
should  be  very  ihaakf nl  to  let  bygones  rest  when 
respectable  people  forget  to  keep  them  in  view 
They  must  remember  that  the  state  of  affairs  to 
wbich  were'er  is  not  so  far  distant  as  to  be  wholly 
forgotten.  There  are  scores  of  people  living  in  this 
city,  the  united  ages  of  three  of  whwm  would  reach 
far  beyond  the  date  of  the  foundation  of  those  col- 
onies, and  their  descendants  s  ould  certainly  pause 
before  they  advance  a  claim  the  investigation  of 
which  only  leaves  them  in  a  very  unenviable  posi- 
tion. 

Our  New  England  friends  must  remember 
that  though  the  Puritan  Pilgrims  whom  they  claim 
as  their  immediate  ancestors  cannot  be  charged 
with  being  of  the  degraded  order  of  society,  (they 
were  similar  in  that  respect,  we  presume,  to  the 
"►Salvation  Army")  ;  they  were  not  so  numerous 
as  the  other  accretions  to  the  colony  before  indica- 


ted. They  were  only  on'  hundred  and  two  includ- 
ing men,  women  and  children,  whereas  the  young 
women  alone,  who  came  to  Virginia, numbered  100, 
and  the  ex  convicts  must  be  more  numerous  than 
either,for  we  find,  from  the  English  Criminal  Code, 
that  about  this  period  there  were  700  executions  per 
annum  in  England,  so  thai  those  sent  to  penal  ser- 
vitude must,  at  least,  be  ten  to  one,  thus  making 
a  total  per  annum  of  7,000.  This  accounts  for  the 
rapid  increase  of  the  English  colonies  in  popula- 
tion, for  very  few  emigrated  in  those  dajs  except 
those  who  were  forced  to.  Our  old  readers  will 
remember  the  quaint  expression  applied  to  persons 
of  doubtful  character, —  "He  will  soon  go  on  the 
herring" — meaning  the  transport  ship. 

In  view  of  all  these  proofs  owr  respectable  Ameri- 
icans  ought  to  be  very  grateful  to  be  let  alone  much 
less  to  challenge  a  review  of  the  social 'antecedents 
of  their  progenitors. 


The  following  is  an  extract  of  a  letter  from  Mr. 
M,  J.  Collins  of  the  Nat.  Mil.  Home,  Montgomery 
Co.  Ohio. 

The  glorious  festival  of  our  Patron  Saint  was  cel- 
ebrated here  in  this  home,  in  a  very  pious  and  chris- 
tianlike manner.  Three  Catholis  priests  came  here 
from  Dayton,  at  2  p  m  on  Sunday  afternoon,  and 
assisted  the  Rev.  Dr.  C.  Kemper  to  hear  the  con- 
fessions of  the  old  Veterans,  and  on  St.  Patrick's 
day  nearly  all  the  Catholics— German  as  well 
as  Irish,  received  Holy  C  )mmunion,  and  the  "Hi- 
bernian Society"  of  the  home  went  to  the  altar  in  a 
body,  and  received  Holy  Communion  ;  it  was  very 
beautiful  and  edifying. 

We  had  High  Mass  on  St.  Patrick's  day,  and  on 
the  centre  of  the  altar  there  was  a  large  and  very 
beautiful  picture  of  St.  Patrick,  and  on  each  side 
of  it  hung  ihe  Irish  and  American  flags.  I  suppose 
you  are  not  aware  that  we  have  a  splendid  choir  of 
veterans  and  a  new  organ. 

The  Rev.  Fr,  Cusack  delivered  the  sermon — it 
was  more  of  a  lecture  than  a  sermon — Subject — 
"The  Government  aided  Proselytizing  Schools", 
and  the  "Famine  in  Ireland" — the  subject  was  a- 
bly  and  well  handled,  and  it  caused  the  hearers  to 
shed  tears  abundantly.  When  the  Government 
Prosel ,  tizers  came  to  the  i-tarving  multitudes  and 
said  to  them, — "Here  change  your  religion  and 
come  with  us,  and  you  shall  have  plenty  to  eat  and 
wear" — but  our  people  spurned  them  and  died  by 
thousands  on  the  road-side  and  in  their  cabins — , 
Martyrs  for  the  Holy  Faith  that  St.  Patrick  so  firm- 
ly plauted  in  their  Christian  hearts,  and  the  "Blood 
of  the  Martyrs  is  the  seed  of  the  church."  And  ho 
said  the  sufl'erings  and  martyrdom  of  so  many 
Christains  and  their  blood  have  cried  out  loudly  to 
Heaven  for  vengeancl  and  the  even  handed  justice 
of  God  requires  Him  to  do  justice  to  Ireland — "Re- 
venge is  mine,  and  I  will  repay",  says  the  Lord  ! 
He  said  if  the  Irish  people  would  be  true  to  their 
religion  and  to  their  God  there  seemed  now  to  be  a 
bright  prospect  before  them  and  their  deliverance 
was  near  at  hand.

•  The  following  is  a  synopsis  of  the  address  made 
by  Mr.  Grilgaanon  before  the  PhiloCeltic  Society 
on  March  6th.  when  commemoratÍDg  the  95th. 
anniversary  oftue  birth  of  the  late  lamented  Arch- 
bishop McHale.  The  ball  was  crowded  and  when- 
ever the  name  of  the  illustrious  dead  was  men- 
tioned it  was  the  signal  for  loud  and  continuous 
applause.  The  eloquent  speaker  being  an  ardent 
admirer  of  Dr.  Me  Hale's  virtuous  patriotism,  the 
•words  thundered  forth  form  the  inermost  recesses 
of  his  heart.  Oh,  and  his  audience  /  with  what 
love  and  devotion  did  they  listen  to  the  recital  of 
the  incidents  ia  the  UNCEOWNED  MONARCH'S 
long  and  patriotic  life?  What  a  lesson  it  should 
teach  to  those  who  pander  to  English  ileas  with 
a  view  of  securing  transitory  wordly  grandeur. 
Where  is  the  other  man  priest,  pope  or  potentate, 
whose  name  is  enshrined  ia  the  hearts  of  his  coun- 
try-men  like  that  of  the  "Lion  of  the  Fold! '  Irish-

was  dear  to  his  heart, — the  language  of  his  fore-

his  country  are  endeavoring  to  root  out  of  the  Zand.

Hartford  , March,     17,    1884- 
Mr.  M.  J,   Logan, 
Dear  Sir, 

Tour  genial  representative  Mr.  Daggan  notified 
me  a  few  days  since  that  another  year's  subscrip 
tion  to  the  Gael  was  duel  I  now  cheerfully  inclose 
a  certified  check  on  First  National  Bank  of  this  ci- 
ty for  two  dollars,  being  amount  due  from  Geo.  B. 
Preston  and  mysel  r.  I  am  pleased  to  learn  that 
the  circulation  of  the  Gael  is  increasing,  and  shall 
earnestly  indulge  the  hope  that  it  will  continue.  I 
regret  to  say  that  1  do  not  understand  the  Irish 
language,  nor  is  there  any  likelihood  of  my  ever 
acquiring  a  knowledge  of  it.  Time  wil  not  permit. 
Although  but  eleven  years  old  when  I  left  Ireland 
in  1848,  I  take  a  lively  interest  in  her  welfare, 
knowing  as  I  do  from  history  and  from  positive 
knowledge  of  the  wrongs  that  have  ijeen  inflicted 
upon  the  people,  this  together  with  the  remem- 
brance 01  my  father's  dying  words,  "Never  forget 
old  Ireland"  .'  caused  me  to  take  an  active  part  in 
the  Parnell  Liud  League  m  jvemeui,  I  am  no  dy- 
namiter, nor  am  I  ever  likely  to  become  one,  to 
favor  such  methods  of  destruction  of  life  and  prop- 
erty would  alienate  the  very  best  sentiment  of  the 
people  of  every  nation,  Irishmen  not  accepted,  pro- 
vided we  confine  ourselves  to  reasonable 
constitutional  demands; 

Theday,  in  my  judgement,  isnotfar  distant  when 
under  the  wise  leadership  of  Charles  Stewart  Par- 
nell, full  justice  will  be  extended  to  the  people  of 
Ireland. 

I  am  no  dynamiter,  as  I  said  before,  nor  do  I 
favor  assassination  ;  but  I  shall  most  fervently  pray 
that  God  in  his  mercy  will  forever  bless  and  protect 
O'Donnell  for  wafting  into  eternity  the  miserable 
informer  Carey. 

With  best  wishes  for  old  [reland  and  the  Gael  I 
am,  Very  respectfully, 

Richard  D.  N  orris. 


Hariford,  Conn.  Feb.  25, 1884 

Mr.  M.  J.  Logan, 
Dear  Sir  : 

I  again  address  you  in  regard  to  our  little  monthly 
f  liend,  the  Gael,  and  I  am  pler-sed  to  see  that  you 
■ite  meeting  with  such  merited  success  in  your  en- 
deavors to  elevate  the  Irish  race  even  against  the 
opposition  of  the  great  majority  of  the  Irish  peo 
pi  ^  themselves,  who  by  thfir  actions  would  make 
the  world  believe  that  they  were  always  a/a.  illiter- 
ate people,  not  possessed  of  a  writfen  language 
Tuanks  to  the  eiideavors  of  you  and  co-workers  in 
th  cause,  we  will  be  in  a  positio/i  before  long  to 
nhow  to  the  world  that  we  are  possessed  of  a  living 
wiitten  language. 

Enclosed  please  find  $12.00  for  which  send  the 
Giel  to  the  following  addresses.  I  send  you  with 
this  letter  the  names  of  three  new  subscribers. 
Please  let  me  know  if  the  others  I  3ent  you  last 
year  are  due  yet.  I  have  not  received  tne  money 
yet  from  two  of  the  paiiies  that  I  now  send  you, 
but  I  will  before  long  and  send  it  to  you. 

With  best  wishes  for  your  future  success, 
I  remain  yours  respectfully, 

P.  J.  Du.gan. 


The  friends  of  Irish  Nationality  need  not  be  sur- 
prised at  Bishop  iMcEvilly's  actions  regarding  the 
Irish  language  when  they  remember  that  he  is  the 
Creature  of  the  late  Cardinal  Onlhn,  and  how  he 
sent  the  priests  of  his  diocese  (Galway)  on  retreat 
during  the  week  in  which  the  late  lamented  Arch- 
bishop McHale' 8  semi-centennial  to  the  episcopacy 
was  being  celebrated  in  Tuam  lest  they  should 
honor  him  with  their  presence.  Hence  his  joining 
the  governmental  forces  to  root  out  the  language 
which  Archbishop  McHale  sought  to  preserve,  is 
not  surprising. 

But  the  name  of  Archbishop  McHale,  "The  Lion 
of  the  Fold"),  will  be  revered  and  houored,  and  his 
memory  commemorated  by  the  millions  of  Irishmen 
all  over  the  world  with  rapturous  euthusiasm,  when 
the  names  of  the  de  nationalizersof  his  unfortunate 
country  shall  be  forgotten,  or,  if  mentioned,  only 
in  execr  .tion. 

What  a  lesson  the  life  of  Cardinal  Cullen  should 
teach  to  pro  English  Irishmen.  He  has  passed  in- 
to "eternal  shade"  where  charity  compels  his  coun- 
trymen to  leave  him,  without  as  much  as  saying 
"The  Lord  have  mercy  on  his  soul.'  ',  whereas  the 
name  of  the  "Lion  of  the  Fold",  whom  he  sought 
to  degrade  in  the  eyes  of  his  countrymen,  shall  ex- 
cite hallelujahs  of  love  and  joy  throughout  all 
parts  of  the  known  world  where  an  Irishman  has 
had  a  footing. 


We  see  by  the  Tuam  News  that  a  late  issue  of  the 
Irish  World  which  reached  Ireland  has  been  seized 
and  confiscated  by  the  English  government.

Notice. 

Owing  to  the  position  taken  by  the  Edueation 
Oomtnissioaers  (as  seen  by  Father  Nolan's  letter  to 
the  Freeman)  towards  the  Irish  Language,  and  the 
evident  relation  which  Biphop  McEvilly's  actions 
bear  to  it,(the  bishop  having  dispensed  with  it  as  a 
necessary  study  in  Tuam  CoZiege,  in  other  words, 
prohibition),  We  reduce  the  price  of  the  Gael 
to  sixty  cents  a  year,  or,  two  copies  for  one  dollar 
to  the  old  country,  in  order  th  bring  it  within  the 
reach  of  all  classes.  Irishmen  will  have  to  work 
if  they  wish  to  retain  their  rights.

Mr.  Logan, 

Brooklyn,  N.  Y. 
Dear  Sir, 

The  here-enclosed  letter  I  received  recently  from 
Ireland.  It  is  a  lithographed  circular-letter,  I  sup- 
pose,— and  I  do  wish  with  all  my  heart,  to  do  some- 
thing to  help  those  good  people,  and  send  them 
my  humble  mite,  be  it  ever  so  little.  They  ask  for 
one  Dallar,~but  my  love  for  everything  Irish  is  so 
great  and  irresistible  that  I  could  send  a  hundred 
Dollars  rather,  and  m^re,  had  I  it  at  my  disposal, 
just  at  present.  But,  if  it  is  acceptible,  I  will  send 
ten  Dollars,  anyhow.  I  cannot  obtain  a  draft  on 
the  Bank  of  Ireland,  here  in  Ithaca,  they  refer  me 
to  New  York  for  that  purpose.  Now,  Dear  Sir, 
will  you  kindly  inform  me,  whether  you  can  get  a 
letter  of  exchange  on  Ireland  for  the  small  sum  of 
ten  Dollars  ?  If  so,  I  shall  send  you  the  amount 
and  additional  charge  for  the  draft.  It  has  to  be 
made  out  (for  greater  safety  and  expediency )  to  the 
name  of  the  Most  Rev.  Dr.  Higgins,  Pelace,  Kil- 
larncy.  Then,  after  you  have  received  the  amount 
from  me,  and  obtained  the  draft  on  Ireland,  in  N. 
York,  have  the  kindness  to  send  the  same  to  me. 
that  I  may  forward  it  from  here,  with  letter,  to  its 
destination  in  Ireland.  You  will  by  a  kind  answer 
lit  your  earliest  convenience,  greatly  oblige 
Yours  very  truly  and  faithfully 
F.  L.  O.  Roehrig. 

Presentation  Convent, 

Castleisiand,  Co.  Kerry,  Ireland, 
Feb,  22d,  84. 
Sir. 

Permit  me  to  ask  of  your  charity  one  dollar,  you 
will  never  miss  this  ;  it  will  be  a  great  boon  to  me. 

A  debt  of  á:i400 — part  due  since  1879— has  to  be 
met  fully,  ere  the  year  closes;  This  debt  has  been 
contracted  under  circumstances  of  imperative  ne- 
cessity, the  details  of  which  I  should  give  but  for 
brevity  sake. 

Reluctantly  I  appeal  to  a  generous  people,  but  no 
other  resource  is  left.  Our  poor  tax-tortured  and 
rack-r<  nted  people  cannot  help  us.  We  know  in 
many  cases  their  food  is  what  a  gentleman  would 
not  give  his  hound,  it  would  be  cruel  to  ask  them. 
Our  means  of  support  is  derived  solely  from  the 
interest  on  the  money  brought  as  dower  by  some 
of  the  Sisters — in  so  remote  a  place 'this  sum  is 
small:  This  has  been  considerably  lessened  by  Hi- 
bernia  Bank  paying  us  nothing  for  two  years.  V^e 
have  been  nfflicted  with  constant  sickness  and  a 
death  every  year  from  1874  to  April  1883  all  young 
and  useful. 

To  remedy  this,  as  far  as  human  means  can

We  teach  the  poor  exolasively  :  have  a  claim  on 
those  who  value  education.  Onr  foundress,  Nano 
Nagle,  being  the  first  in  1769  to  dare  to  educate 
by  means  of  her  schools,  the  long-neglected  Irish 
child.  In  our  Dublin  Convent  the  first  Srs.  of 
Mercy  were  formed  to  Religious  life.  Many  of  our 
immediate  pupils  are  valued  members  of  Religious 
Houses  in  the  states  as  well  as  in  the  old  country. 
By  aiding  us  you  enable  lis  to  fit  our  poor  ones  to 
be  useful  to  you  and  a  credit  to  Faith  and  Country 
in  your  midst  where  the  future  of  so  many  of  them 
lies: 

In  return  for  your  alms,  you  rank  among  our 
Benefactors,  for  whose  well-being  special  daily 
prayers  are  ofl'ered  and  two  monthly  Communions 
while  the  Convent  lasts.  The  Holy  Sacrifice  every 
day  next  May  and  June,  and  deceased  relatives  in- 
cluded. Do  not  refuse  please.  I  have  had  only 
two  replies  to  nearly  400  appeals  sent  out  since 
Autumn  last. 

Excuse  and  beiieve  me  to  remain, 
Sir, 

faithfully  yours,

A  MODERN   COLOSSUS- 

The  Colossus  of  Rhodes  must  take  a  back  seat. 
Bartholdi's  Statue  of  "Liberty  Eulightening  the 
World''  is  a  revelation.  New  York  is  to  be  envied. 
And  in  some  smaller  degree  we  may  be  envied: 
We  have  just  been  presented  with  a  superb  picture, 
26x36,  by  the  Travelers  Ins.  Co;,  of  Hartford,  Conn, 
giving  a  capital  representation  of  the  majestic  im- 
age. 


The  Laavenwor^h  (Kansas)  Visitor  has  come  un- 
der the  individual  control  of  Mr.  Johnson.  It  is 
the  recognized  organ  of  Catholicity  in  Kansa?,  also 
of  the  Immigration  Society.  We  see  by  its  late  is- 
sue a  list  of  what  is  represented  to  be  very  desira 
ble  farms  cheap,  aud  on  easy  terms.  Here  is  where 
the  surplus  population  of  our  cities   should  settle. 

The  want  of  suffieient  accommodation  for  their 
increased  business  has  compelled 

The  Singer  Sewing  Ma- 
chine Co. 

to  move  to  the  spacious  store  and  ware-rooms,  591 
Fulton  St.,  near  Flatbush  av. 

fii^"  Why  is  the  «'SINGER  "  so  much  sought 
after?  Answer.—  THIRTY-FIVE  TEARS' 
TRIAL  before  an  enZightened  public  has  domon- 
Btrated  its  wo-.th. — Hence  the  demand  .'
