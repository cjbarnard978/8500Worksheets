§  124.  Class  III. 

(A).  In  S.  L.  these  are  treated  like  verbs  in  -ig, 
except  in  verbal  noun.  Thus,  Iaoaih,  speak  ; 
-oibi|i,  banish ;  m<\|\b,  kill,  are  treated  as  if 
tAb|\tiig,  'oibpig,  m<x]\buig  ;  and  future  and  con- 
ditional are  thus,  t<\b|\ócA,o  (pr.  LVbjiogdT)), 
'oibjieócA'o,  rriAjVb)óc<yo,  etc. 

§  125.  (B).  The  older  usage,  which  has  survived  in  a  few- 
places,  was  to  transfer  last  consonant  of  the 
root  to  the  place  of  -c-  in  the  terminations 
-eócAT),  etc.,  thus — 

Future  •oibeoyvA'o,  r\Air\,  |\ató  ;  |aauuito,  yvAfo,  -f\Ait> ;  so  in  Condit.

§  126.  The  most  usual  ending  is  -<vó,  -eá-ó  ;  as  I.  T>ún<vó, 
closing;  rmVle<YÓ,  destroying;  II.  rn-mui§<yó, 
calming;  rm cm mi^cvó,  swearing  ;  II.  words  .of  this 
class  generally  form  the  verbal  noun  differently.

For  the  use  of  the  verbal  noun  for,  A.  the  present 
participle,  as  AuÁirn  a^  mmA-ó  ah  -oo|\tnr*,  I  am  [at 
(the)]  closing  [of]  the  door ;  and  B,  the  infinitive 
active  and  passive,  see  Syntax.  For  other  forms 
and  declension  of  the  verbal  noun  see  below,  §§  129, 
etc.

Forms  and  Declension  of  the  Verbal  Noun. 

^  128.  The  verbal  noun  is  put  to  various  uses  in  Irish, 
being  made  to  do  duty  not  only  as  a  noun,  but  as 
a  present  participle  and  as  an  infinitive.  It 
offers  also  much  variety  of  form,  especially  in 
verbs  of  Class  I.,  §  102,  and  particularly  in  the 
modern  spoken  language. 

Verbs  of  Class  I. 

§  129.  The  usual  termination  of  the  verbal  noun  in  the 
nom.  sing,  is  £a*ó,  as  -oúua-ó,  closing;  rrn'lleA'ó, 
destroying.  Verbal  nouns  of  this  form  are  declined 
in  a  peculiar  way — the  gen.  sing,  and  all  the  cases 
in  plural  except  the  genitive,  being  of  the  same 
form  as  the  passive  participle,  §  127;  thus,  T>ún<vó, 
gen.,  etc.,  rnmcA,  rmVCe<vó,  rmtlce  ;  r^ApA-o,  r-^ApuA. 

1.  In  S.  L.  these  verbals  are  sometimes  and  wrongly  declined 

according  to  First  Declension,  as  •oiimvo,  •oún.ai'ó. 

2.  Instead  of  e&x>,  a-ó  is  added  to  some  verbs  whose  last 

vowel  is  slender — a  broadening,  §  3,  then  takes  place  in 
the  parts  ending  in  -&t>  :— - 

flu/5,  flu^A-ó,  fUn^ce,  swallow  ;    t>ói§,    -oóg^'ó, 
•oóijce,  burn;  boipg,  lopgA-ó,  loif^ce,  burn. 


36 

§  130.   Another  termination  for  some  verbs  is  -earn,  and 
the  gen.,  etc.,  are  formed  as  above,  §  129. 
c<\iu,  CAiceAiii,  cAicce,  spend, 
•oeun,  •oeunArii,  -oetmcA,  spend. 

1.  These  terminations  were  in  O.I.  -orh,  -erh,  gen.  -rno,  -iriA, 

-iiie ;  traces  are  found  in  words  formed  from  them,  as 
c\iciiieo,c,  prodigal  ;  mAiérhe^cAr",  forgiveness  ;  "oeun- 
m&y,  material. 

2.  In  S.  L.  these  are  sometimes  declined  as  of  First  Declen- 

sion, gen.  -irh. 

§  131.  Another  termination  is  -Á1I;  gen.,  etc.,  -aIa,   as 
54b,  5<\bÁil,  take. 

I.  This  is  the  termination  used  in  S.  L.  with  English  words, 
as  robÁ^,  ttySih,  boycott Alt. 

§  132.  Rarer  terminations. 

A.  -Ac,  gen.  -A15,   as   ^íaoí-ó,  ^tokOOAc,  t^lAoroce, 

call. 

B.  -acu,  gen.  acca,   as  fan,  fAnAcc,   stay;   teAn, 

leAHACu,  in  S.  L.,  follow  ;  sltWf,  ^tuAf  acu, 
gluaifce,  move ;  éi^u,  éirce<\cc,  listen. 

C.  -eACCAin  ;    ^<\oit,   -leACCAin  (also   -tfin,   -leA- 

n'lAin),  think;  niAi|i,  rnAi|\e<\ccAin  (in  S.  L. 
sometimes  niAi|\eAccÁit),  live. 

D.  Many  verbs  have  verbal  in  -e ah'i &\x\,gen.  -rrmA, 

as  oil,  oiteAiiiAin,  rear ;  cum,  cmneAiiiAin, 
decide. 

In  S.  L.  -rhAinc. 

E.  A  few  in  -CAirm  ;  as  mAiji,  mApcAinn,  live  (also 

-}\e<\ccAin)  yeA|\,  -|\ÚAinn,  give. 

F.  A  few   in   -fin;  as  CU15,  zwgym,  gen.  -ponA, 

understand  ;  c]ieio  --opn,  believe  (also  -'oeArh 
and  -•oeAiiiAin)  ;  catjvg,  ~5fm,  offer  ;  p\ic  -fin, 
see  (now  -jreic-). 


37 

G.  A  few  in  -ean  ;  as  te&^,  ~5<*n,  knock ;  tei^, 
-^eAn,  allow  ;  cjtéi^,  -^e^n,  O.  I.,  -^eA-ó, 
forsake. 

In  S.  L.  pronounced  -auic. 

H.  Some  monosyllables  in  "L,  n,  add  c  ;  as  bam, 
-nc,  take;  biu\in,  -nc,  reap  ;  ceit,  -tc,  conceal ; 
pt,  pic  and  pte<vó,  conceal  ;  rneil,  -tc,  grind. 

I.  A  few  in  -rn,  mi  ;  cine,  -enn,  fall  ;  x)]\ui"o,  -thtti, 
close  ;  501]%  5oij\rn  and  ^Aipm,  call. 

J.   Peculiar,  -ia]\|i,  ia^iato,  ia|\]u\ua,  seek,  ask  for. 

i  133.  In  addition  to  those  various  exceptional  endings, 
we  often  find  instead  of  a  verbal  noun  formed 
from  the  verbal  stem,  that  the  stem  itself,  or  the 
noun  from  which  the  verb  is  formed,  is  used 
instead — ]iomn,  a  division  ;  110111111111,  divide  ;  A5 
110111H,  dividing;  ót,  drink;  oIauii,  a^  ót,  drink- 
ing. [Even  ordinary  nouns  from  which  no  verb 
is  formed  as  so  used  with  a$  ;  a^  cUncce  (at  play) 
playing  ;  A5  AOibneAf  (at  pleasure),  revelling.] 

134.  In  such  cases  we  often  find  broadening  of  vowels, 
as  §  129,  1,  as  pubAit,  walk  ;  puoAt,  verbal, 
gen.  puDAÍCA  ;  coi|^,  co^,  coi^ce,  check  ;  cuin, 

CUp,  CUflCA,  put. 

Vepbs  of  Class  II. 

135.  The  usual  termination  here  also  (v.  §  129)  is  -ax>, 
and  the  gen.  sing.,  and  all  plural  forms  except  ^/j. 
are  like  the  passive  participle,  as — 

Tmonnmt  nnomuigAO  nnonnui^ce 

5HÁ*óuig  ^liÁóti^A-ó  ^HÁ-ómgce 


38 

§  136.  Notice  the  elision  of  1  in  the  termination  -1125,  when  -ax>  is  added. 
When  the  vowel  of  the  root  of  the  verb  is  slender,  a  broadening 
must  take  place  when  -At)  is  added  ;  as  tnimg,  mirncJA-o,  now 
spelled  mniuigAT),  as 

11111115  míniu§<YÓ  mínigúe 

-poittpg  -poillpti§A"ó  ^oilbptjce 

I.  Verbs  in  -ui  j  are  formed  from  words  in  -ac  ;  until  recently 
the  verbs  were  spelled  with  -A15,  and  in  Scotland  even 
yet  with  -aich,  as  do  ghradhaich  i?ii~x>o  gruvóuij  mé. 
Some  end  in   -rung,  as  pi  orpin  §,  enquire,   from  piop 


some  in  -nuig,  as 
a  lie. 


5,  as  popping,   enquire,    irom  piop  ; 
bpeu5n1.11 5,   contradict,  from  bpeug, 


2.  In  a  few  words  the  0  is  retained,  as  ionrp<?JAT>,  eulóJA'ó. 
§  137.  Another  termination  in  S.   L.   for  a  few  verbs  is 
-ac An,  as — 

'cubing         -0ACA11         darkening 
^eAling        -Iacaii  brightening 

(niAroing)  -neAc<Mi  morning 
meAmng  -"oacati  weighing 
becróuig        --ÓACAn  enlivening 

I.  "OubACAti  is  used  =  potato  blight,  meAÓACAii,  weight; 
maiTmeACAti  is  rare,  'oo  bi  ah  Iá  aj  m,  T)'éipi 5  pé  té 
111,  ah  ÍAe. 

§  1 38.  Some  few  verbs  use   the   noun  from  which  they 
are  formed,  as — 
CUIÍTOU15,  protect,  a^  cun'iDAC,  ctniiDtn^úe 
iiéróag,  settle  -ceAc,  -ague

Verbs  of  Class  III. 

§  140.  The  termination  -a*o  is  found,  co-oaz'I,  sleep"  a^ 
cooIa-ó,  co-oaIxa. 

§  141.  But  most  of  these  verbs  add  -c  to  the  root. 
•oibi]\,  --pc,  -]Ace,  or  -eAjiCA,  banish 
T)iot;Ait,  -tu,  -aIca,  revenge

Use  of  Nouns  as  Verbals. 

§  143.  We  have  seen  in  §  133  that  ordinary  nouns  are 
used  as  verbals — in  this  case,  they  are  not  declined 
as  ordinary  nouns,  but  have  the  gen.,  etc.,  like  the 
passive  participle  of  the  verb,  as 

ót,  ótuA,  drinking  ;  pnróe,  --óce,  sitting ;  tuíge, 
-gee,  lying. 

§  144.  In  S.  L.  certain  terminations  are  frequently  met 
with,  as  -yAc,  bui]\,  low  (of  cattle)  a^  búipr:eAc  ; 
metm,  a  mouth  ;  meun^AC,  yawning  ;  -yAirvu,  as  A5

-Ac,  dative  -Aig,  as  a^  cAr*AccAi^,  coughing;  a^ 
•p5|-ieucAig,  screaming  ;  and  -ui§it,  -§aiI,  as  A5 
freAXDtn^it,  whistling.  Nouns  in  -ói])eAcc,  formed 
from  names  of  agents  in  -óijt,  are  also  used,  as 
téi5Úeoi|A,  a  reader;  0,5  léií;ceói}\eAcc,  reading. 
So  (r-pe<\t,  a  scythe  ;  ppeAtA-oóip,  a  mower)  a^ 
r-peAtAoóijieAcc,  mowing.

§  145.  There  are  three  verbs  "to  be"  if  mé,  it  is  I  ;  AcÁnn, 
I  am  (with  dependent  form  finbm)  ;  andbi-oim,  I

(i)Oa  is  not  aspirated  by  the  particle  •00  §  1 3.  When  preceded  by other  particles 
and  po  §  14,  aspiration  takes  place,  as  niop  bA  é  it  was  not  he

also  used. 
§  206.  The  Verb  "  to  know." 

A.  A  noun  is  used,  piop,  eot,  etc.,  ip  piof  "ootn,  ip  eoL  com  ;  or 

an  adjective,  ip  peApAC  111  é.  The  phrase  acá  a  pop  AgAm 
50,  "I  have  (its)  knowledge  that  .  ."  has  given  rise  to  the 
colloquial  cÁ'p  a^aui,  which  is  used  almost  like  a  verb,  cÁ'p 
A^Atn  é,  I  know  him. 

B.  After  particles   the  negative  forms   of  the  above  phrases  are 

used  :  ni  piop  "oom,  ni  h-eob  -oom,  ah  peApAC  CÁ,  ah  bptnb 
piop  AgAc  ?  In  Munster  the  old  word  peAT)Ap  is  used  in  pre- 
sent tense,  ni  p.  AomneAC,  nobody  knows. 

§  207.  The  Verb  cÁplA. 

This  verb  is  really  the  3rd  sing,  perfect  of  a  verb  pÁÍA^'oo  +  pÁlA. 

It  is  now  cÁpbAp  -Aip  -La  ;  AmAp  -AbAp  -ATJAp 
The  phrase  ó  cÁpÍA  (since  it  has  happened)  =  since  it  is  ;  ó  cÁpÍA 

50,  whereas  (with  a  verb).

Adverbs. 

§  209.   Adverbs  are  formed  from  adjectives  by  prefixing  50,  before  vowels, 
50  h-  ;  as  50  uiAic,  well,  50  h-olc,  badly. 


55 

$  210.  The  phrase  50  teop,  enough,  is  [compounded  of  50,  with,  Leon, 
sufficiency. 

§  211.  The  sentence,  "  he  spoke  well,"  can  be  translated  either  simply  x>o 
lAbA-ip  pé  50  rriAic,  or  if  more  prominence  is  to  be  given  to  the 
adverb,  the  construction  can  be  made  more  emphatic  (cf.  "  'tis 
well  he  spoke"),  if  mAic  "oo  lAbAip  pé.  In  this  case  50  is 
omitted. 

The  comparatives  and  superlatives  of  adverbs  are  the  same  as  of 
corresponding  adjectives  (§§  100,  101),  and  instead  of  50,  the  par- 
ticles niop,  ni  bA,  ni  buf  are  used  before  them  :  bAbrvAim  niop 
peÁpp  ah oi}%  t>o  LAbpAp  ni  b'peApp ;  lAibeopAt»  ni  bup  peÁpp, 
"  I  speak,  spoke,  shall  speak,  better." 

When  the  emphatic  form  of  construction  is  used,  §  210,  these  par- 
ticles are  not  used  :  if  peApp  bAbpAim,  no  lAbpAp,  lAibeopAT). 

Adverbial  phrases  are  very  common.  They  consist  chiefly  of  a  pre- 
position and  a  noun,  §  5,  1.

The  Pronoun. 

Personal  Pronouns. 

§  215.  The  personal  pronouns  are,  mé,  I,  me  ;  cú,  tú, 
thou,  thee  ;  pé,  é,  he,  him,  it ;  pi,  1,  she,  he,  it ; 
e<vó,  it  ;  pnn,  mn,  we,  us  ;  pib,  1b,  ye,  you  ;  pi<vo, 
iat>,  they,  them. 

(1.)  The  singular  cú,  thou,  is  used  for  one  person,  -yib,  you 
(plural)  is  hardly  ever  admissible.  In  a  few  places  it  is 
used  for  respect. 

§  216.  The  forms  without  p,  é,  í,  ia*o,  and  the  form  cu, 
are  used  (1)  when  they  are  in  the  accusative  case, 
(2)  when  the  verb  of  the  sentence  is  ip,  and  when 
(a)  a  word  or  words  intervene  between  ip  and  the 
pronoun  (b),  or  ip  is  omitted  after  a  particle.  At 
present  these  forms  are  used  even  when  (c)  they 
immediately  follow  ip.  They  are  also  used  after 
(d)  cia,  cat),  and  after  At^up  and  1011Á. 

Hence,  x>o  "bi  pé  A^uy  mé  Ann.  "Oo  VjuaiL  pé  í.  1r*  pp  ia-o. 
tIac  é,  ni  h-i.  Cia  h-é,  cat)  é?  T)o  "bi  peAp  Ann  Agup  é 
a^  thjI.  a  "bAite.  Ip  peApp  mé  ionÁ  iat).  1p  cú  An 
peAp,  ip  é  An  peAp. 

§  217.  The  forms  mn,  ib  are  now  rare.  Sé,  pi,  é,  fiti,  according  to  the 
gender  of  the  noun  in  the  sentence,  as  ip  mAic  An  pjeuL  é,  ip 
mAic  An  mm  i.  The  neuter  eAT>  {prou.  ah)  is  used  to  represent  a 
whole  phrase  ;  as,  An  mAic  An  Íá  é?  It  is  a  good  day  ?  1p 
eA"o  =  if  (mAic-an-LA-a).  It  is  //(viz.,  a  good  day).  Thus,  ip 
eAt),  contracted  'pe<v°  oíten=yes,  and  ní  h-eA"ó  —  no. 

%  218.  Thus  are  explained  constructions  like  the  ordinary  Munster  Aimpp 
"bpeÁj  ip  eAt)  é,  it  is  fine  weather,  lit.  fine  weather :  it  is  so. 


57 

§  219-  The  pronoun  can  be  made  emphatic  either  by 
adding  -pém,  -self  (in  S.  L.  fern,  §  2);  as  mé  rem, 
cú  -pénri  ;  or  by  adding  the  emphatic  particles 
peculiar  to  the  persons,  producing  meipe,  rmpe; 
cur- a,  peipeAn,  eipeAn  (S.  L.  p e-pAn,  e-p An)  ;  pipe, 
ipe  ;  p'nn-n-e,  pb-f*e,  ],iA,o-|,Afl>  i<vo-fAn. 

§  220.  Note  the  shortening  of  vowels  in  mi  ye  cuy-a,  yeiyeoai,  fife,  from  mé, 
cú,  ré,  p. 

PRErOSITIONAL     PRONOUNS. 

§  221.  Pronouns  amalgamate  with  simple  prcpositions,and 
to  some  extent  with  prepositional  phrases,  forming 
a  new  part  of  speech  :  e.g.,  A^Am,  a^au,  Ai^e,  aici  ; 
A£<vmn,  A^Aib,  aca.     See  Third  Book,  p.  37. 

§  222.  When  prepositional  phrases,  such  as  óp  cionn, 
above,  lit.,  over-head-of,  governing  the  genitive, 
come  in  contact  with  personal  pronouns,  the  result 
is  peculiar,  óp  mo  cionn,  over-head-of  me,  lit.  over 
my  head  ;  óp  -oo  cionn,  óp  a  cionn.  So  in  a 
cnnceoJLL  around  it.  See  prepositional  phrases 
below. 

Relative   Pronouns. 

§  223.  I.  Norn,  and  accus.  with  verbs,  note  aspiration, 
§15.  In  these  cases,  no  relative  is  used  in  Irish  :  An 
feAji  t>o  buAiteAp,  the  man  (whom)  I  struck  ;  An 
peAp  00  buAit  An  cApAlt,  the  man  who  struck  the 
horse ;  An  peAp  buAileAp  An  clo^,  the  man  (who) 
rings  the  bell. 


53 

-§  224.  So  An  -peAn  acá  cmn,  An  peAyv  A-oeip,  the  in.  who  says,  where  the 
a-  is  part  of  the  verb,  but  sentences  like  these  gave  rise  to  the  use 
of  a  in  S.  L.  as  an  ordinary  relative,  not  only  (a)  where  there 
should  be  no  particle,  An  peAr\  a  biT>eAr,  a  biiAileAr,  a  minrAr, 
A  nnonnócA]',  but  (b)  where  the  particle  x>o  should  be  [with  im- 
perfect, perfect,  conditional,  and  with  a  few  irregular  verbs  like 
•oo-beir\,  "oo-ci-o]  as,  An  peAf»  A  buAib,  who  struck,  a  beirxeAr, 
who  gives. 

:§  225.  Negative  form  :  the  negative  ru\c  (before  perfect 
nAC4]\,  flÁ|\)  is  used  before  the  verb  ;  An  ye<\]\  nAc 
bpnt,  who  is  ;  nAc  nnúiiAtin  ah  -oopip  who  does 
not  close;  nÁÓA]\  (nÁp)  mm  ah  *ooj\ur  ;  An  ye&]\ 
nAc  nibiKMlim,  nÁ|\  bu<\ileAp  zvlioiu  I  do  not  strike, 
did  not  strike. 

§  226.  The  particle  noc,  often  found  in  books  and  MSS. 
used  for  relative,  is  not  now  heard  :  a^,  ua  pp 
noc  "oo  bi  Ann,  ha  p}\  noc  bi-óeAr*  Ann. 

;§  227.  II.  Genitive.  The  older  form  ip\,  whose,  is  no 
longer  used.  Instead  of  saying,  "the  man  whose 
foot  was  broken,"  the  construction,  "  the  who  had 
his  foot  broken,"  that  is  (according  to  the  Irish 
idiom  of  cÁ  +  A^Atn  =  /  have),  "  the  man  at  zvJiom 
his  f.  was  broken,"  An  yeAn  a$  aj\  hpr-eAti  a  cop 
So  An  ye&]\  a^  a  bpn l  a  cor*  b|\i]xe  =  whose  f.  is 
broken.  In  negative  sentences  iuc  is  substituted 
for  the  a,  the  relative  above. 

228.  In  S.  I/.  Ag  a,  aj;  a\\,  are  often  sounded  in  Munster  as  50,  £Uf\,  An 
reA]\  50  bptnl,  etc.  In  Conn.,  the  aj  is  omitted,  An  peAr\  a 
bruit,  aw  peAp  An  b^reAU  a  cor.  So  with  negative,  An  reAn 
nAc  bpmb  a  cor  bjurce,  nÁn  brvireA-ó  a  cor. 

The  English  whose  is  often  equivalent  to  Irish  to-whom,  as,  peAr\ 
•OA-n-Ab  Ainm  Seumur,  a  man  whose  (to-whom)  name  is  James. 

For  compound  prepositions  given  the  genitive — for  the  construction 
see  following  paragraph  : — 


59 

§  229.  Dative  with  prepositions.  The  relative  a  is  used. 
Note  aspir.  and  eclip.,  §  27,  1.  As,  An  ye&y  té  a 
b-ptnlnn  05  c<\mc,  té  a  -pADA-p  A5  cauic,  An  áic  m 
A]\  cmceAf,  the  place  in  which  I  fell.  Negative, 
uac,  nAc<x]\  (nÁ|V)  An  ye<\y  té  tuc  bptnlnn,  An  Áic 
m  nÁjt  tmyzeAy. 

§  230.  A  strange  usage  in  S.  L.  is  to  remove  the  preposition  (leaving  the 
a,  a\\,  tiAc,  nÁn  still  before  the  verb,  and  affecting  it  as  if  preposi- 
tion were  still  there)  to  the  end  of  sentence,  and  changing  it  to  pre- 
positional pronoun,  corresponding  in  number  and  gender  to  the 
subject  of  the  relative  sentence.  Thus.  ah  p&An  be  a  bpuibim  aj; 
CAinc  becomes  ah  p.  a  bp.  Ag  came  lets;  ay\  beAn  aj\  a  pAbApAg 
CAinc  becomes  ah  b.  a  pAbAf  a^  c.  uirre ;  via  OAome  bé  riÁp 
ÍAbAip  pé  becomes  n.  x>.  tiÁp  l.  pé  leo. 

§  231.  With  compound  prepositions  this  transference  brings  about  such  sen- 
tences as  tiA  pip  a  pAib  pé  óp  a  5-ciorm,  the  men  overhead — of 
whom  he  was.  These  forms  where  the  prepos.  pronouns  appear 
at  the  end  are  only  shortened  by  the  omission  of  Ag  from  sentences 
like  those  above,  ha  pip  ag  a  p<vib  pé,  etc.  So  comApcA  Ag  a 
gctnppióeAp  '11A  AJAVÓ,  a  sign  which  shall  be  contradicted. 

§  232.  Translation  of  where.  (A.)  Instead  of  An  Áicm  a 
bp.11  Inn,  the  place  where  (in  which)  I  am,  the  form 
An  Ate  a  hy.,  An  Áiu  1  hy.  is  met  with  both  in  spoken 
and  written  language.  The  a  or  1  is  the  old  dative 
or  locative  case  of  relative.  It  is  also  seen  in  cia 
au  ÓA01  a  bjrtu  I  cu  ?  How  are  you,  where  A=m 
a,  A|\  a.  (B.)  Where  is  also  translated  by  rriAjA  a 
(eclip.)  iiia]\  an,  aspir.,  niA]t  a  -jtAtb  ye,  where  he 
was,  rriAN  A]t  cine  ye,  where  he  fell. 

§"233.  All  that  which,  what,  are  translated  by  a,  the  old 
neuter  relative,  in  all  cases.  This  a  eclipses  verbs, 
when  followed  by  ]to  it  aspirates :  e.i.  Sm  a 
bfuit  uAim,  fin  a  ]\Aib  u<\irn,  that  is  all  that  I 
want,  wanted.     &\\  triA]\b  yé  Wn  £émn,  all  of  the 


6o 

parm  that  he  killed.  An  ye<\\\  if  ujiéme  *oÁ  VjpnL 
in  éirunn,  the  bravest  man  of  all  that  are  in  Erin. 
Instead  of  a  we  sometimes  find  ^ac  a  ;  t^ac  a 
1í)]?ac4  -pé,  everything  he  saw. 


Possessive  Pronouns. 

234.  The  possessive  pronouns  are  mo,  *oo,  a,  my,  thy, 
his,  its  {aspir.),  <\,  her,  its  (prefixes  1i  to  vowels), 
A]1,  bu]i  (rtiA]\),  a,  our,  your,  their  (eclip.) 

1.  Before  vowels  mo  becomes  m',  nV  ;  t>o  becomes  "o',  c',  c'; 

a,  his,  is  omitted  in  S.  L.  In  Minister  otitis  pron.  búr\, 
úri,  n'iír\  ;  in  Ulster  niA]\  is  used  instead — the  old  form 
was  h&\\. 

2.  For  one  person,  T»o,  thy,  is  always  used,  except  in  parts  of 

Donegal,  where  marx  is  used  for  respect,  as,  Sé  mArv 
mbeACA,  a  f  AgAirxc  !  The  same  usage  is  often  found  in 
books  of  17th  century. 

3.  For  a  strange  use  of  a,  a  particle  having  same  effects  as 

a,  her,  see  numerals  ;  a  crvi,  a  h-occ,  a  h-Aon,  a  pee, 
3,  8,  1,  20.  For  an  idiomatic  use  of  a,  his,  its  (as,  &v& 
a  pop  AjAm  50  .  .,  I  know  (it)  that  ;  ip  p'orv  A  rwvó 
50  .   .,  it  is  true  to  say  (it)  that  .  .),  see  Syntax. 

235.  Prepositions  become  compounded  with  the  pos- 
sessive pronouns:  T)om'=*oo-f-mo,  so  vox)',  t>'a, 
'o'aji.  So  Cjtém=u|ié  +  mo,  so  z\\éx> :  -d^om',  '50m' 
=a$  mo,  A^A,  ^a=a^  a.  The  prepos.  in  loses  the 
n,  and  in  mo  becomes  im',  Am'  ;  so  ix>,  a*o,  ic,  ac  = 
in  t)o.  The  other  contractions  are  obvious.  In 
Minister,  at;  mo,  a^  t>o  are  contr.  to  Am,  a*o  ;  as 
ni  a-o'  "oeAjtmA-o  AcÁim  =  ní  a^  -oo  .  .  'tis  not  for- 
getting you  I  am  ;  nÁ  bí  Am  buAió]\eA*ó,  don't  be 
annoying  me. 


6i 

§  236.  Emphasis  is  shown  either  by  using  the  suffix 
pern  (mo,  "oo,  a  ca^aIX  ]?éin,  my  own  horse),  or  by 
adding  the  emphatic  endings  for  each  person,  mo 
-pA,  T)o  -]\\,  a  -pAn,  a  -p  ;  A|\  -ne,  bup  m^n  -ne, 
a  --pAn. 

Demonstrative  Pronouns  and  Adjectives. 

§  237.  The  demonstrative  particles  are  po,  p,  peo,  this  ; 
-pom,  pn,  that ;  pú*o,  piút>,  ú-o,  that. 

I.  Sút)  refers  to  something  connected  with  the  person  to 
whom  you  speak,  mentioned  or  remembered  by,  or  well 
known  to  that  person.  Strictly  speaking,  the  forms  with 
broad  vowels,  po,  pom,  should  be  used  after  nouns  where 
last  vowel  is  broad  ;  but  now  po,  pom  are  the  forms 
usual  in  Munster,  and  peo  (shiih),  pin,  in  Connaught. 
Slit)  is  never  used  after  a  noun — always  úx>  -An  LÁ  ut>, 
and  in  S.  L.  iro  has  the  forms  ú-oa,  tj-o-an. 

§  238.  When  used  after  nouns,  po,  pn,  út)  have  no  accent, 
but  are  sounded  as  part  of  the  noun,  as,  An  peAppo, 
An  beAnux). 

§  239.  So,  pn,  pur»  are  used  as  pronouns  ;  as  (ip)  po  ah 
peAp,  pm  au  beAn,  put)  An  buACAitl.  But  now  the 
personal  pronoun  is  added,  as  (ip)  é  pm  au  peAp,  or 
pn  é  au  peAp  ;  An  1  pm  An  beAn  ?  put)  uvo  ua 
-OAome,  aca  pé  po  cttin. 

§  240.  Similarly,  for  the  possessive  cases,  "  of  this,  that, 
those  (man,  woman,  people,  etc.),  a  (his,  her,  its, 
their)  is  used,  followed  by  yo,  pm  or  put) ;  as,  a 
beAn  pin,  the  wife  of  that  man  ;  a  peAp  po,  the 
husband  of  this  woman  ;  a  bpeApAnn  put),  the 
land  of  those  people. 


02 

§  241.  Again,  when  a  preposition  precedes  this,  that, 
those  (jnan,  woman,  etc.),  the  whole  is  translated 
by  a  prepositional  pronoun  ;  with  this  man^Aige 
•po  (=a^  é  -po),  1]"  Ai^e  \o  acá  An  teAbAp,  it  is  this 
man  who  has  the  book;  leip  r*o  (  =  le  é  po),  ip 
teip  yo  An  teAbAp,  the  book  belongs  to  this  man  ; 
tnppi  pn  (=A|\  í  pn),  ip  uippi  pn  t>o  bi  An  cuIaiú 
up,  it  is  on  that  (woman)  the  new  dress  was  ; 
u Ait)  po,  hence,  from  this;  aca  put),  with  those 
people. 

Interrogative  Pronouns. 

§  242.  Cia  :  Who  ?  cia  t>o  biu\il  é,  who  struck  him  ?  cia 
biKM  leAp,  who  strikes.  With  pronouns  :  cia  h-é, 
cia  I1-1,  cu\  h-iAt),  cia  tú  pém  ?  who  is  he,  she,  etc.  ? 
Cia  1i-é  ah  yeAp  pn,  cia  h-i  An  beAn  lit»,  cia 
h-iAt)  ua  t)Aome  pn  Anonn  ? 

Whom  ?     Cia  t»o  buAib  ye,  whom  did  he  strike? 

What  ?  I.  Cia  An  p*eA}\  é,  what  man,  cia  ah  beAn  í  ? 
2.   Cia  rheiro,  what  number  or  quantity? 

Along  with  cia,  the  form  cé  is  found  in  the  oldest  forms  of 
the  language,  and  this  is  the  word  now  usually  heard 
in  most  of  the  country  ;  cé  An  ^eAn?  cé  &r\  beAn  ?  cé 
pn  ?  cé  nieu-o. 

§  243.  The  form  ereud  (=ciA  +  pu-o,  what  thing  ;  in  S-  L. 
often  ceujvo)  is  also  heard. 

§  244.  Ca  CÁ  cé,  what  ?  are  used  with  nouns  ;  hence,  the 
ordinary  forms,  cÁ  h-UAip,  cÁ  h-Ain,  cAyAroe,  when, 
how  long  ?  Cé  ionnup,  now  cAnnup  (Munst.) 
ciAiinup,  ciAnnop  (Conn.),  how?  CÁ  h-Áiu,  cÁ 
h-ionAt),  CAUAt)  (Munst.)  where?  The  forms  ci a 
ah  Air,  cia  au  C-A111,  etc.,  are  also  common.  This 
ca  is  frequently  spelled  5Á.

§  245-  Caide,  now  usually  ca*o  é,  is  a  compound  of  ca, 
with  a  part  of  the  verb  to  be :  cad  é  au  yeA]\  pn, 
what  man  is  that?  Cat)  i<vo  ua  -oAoitie,  who  are 
the  people  ? 

§  246.  Cad,  what  ?     Ca-o  -oubAipc  ye  ?  what  did  he  say  ? 

Note  the  use  of  the  relative  form  of  the  verb  after 
the  interrog.  pronouns. 

§  247.  Whose  ?  There  is  no  genitive  form  of  the  interro- 
gative pronoun.  Whose  ?  often  =  belonging  to- 
w/10711 ?  and  is  then  translated  with  the  preposi- 
tion te  (ip  +  bom  =  I  own)  :  cia  teif  é,  whose  is 
it  ?     See  below,  249,  1. 

§  248.  Whose  ?  in  other  positions  is  translated  by  cia, 
ca-o,  with  preposition. 

§  249.    Wliom,  what  ?  with  preposition  : 

To  whom  :  cia  t>'a|\  innpf  é,  to  whom  did  you 
tell  it  ?  Of,  from,  whom  :  cia  *o'a]\  bAineA-ó  é,  of 
whom  was  it  taken  ?  By  whom  :  ci  a  té  a  mbuAit- 
ye&]\  é,  by  whom  will  he  be  struck  ? 

1.  In  S.  L.  as  in  case  of  relative  §  230,  the  preposition  disappears, 

and  prepositional  pronoun  is  substituted  ;  cia  aj\  mtnf  cú 
•00  é,  cia  Af\  bAmeAt)  -oe  é,  cia  a  mbuAilpeAp  Leip  é. 
And  often,  especially  in  short  questions,  the  prepos.  prcn. 
is  found  after  cia:  cia  t>ó  aj\  mmr"  ctí  é?  ci<i  leif  a 
mbAitteónn  yé,  to  whom  does  it  belong?  cia  leip  é? 
whose  (is)  it  ?  t)o  beu]\AO  Aiyv^eAt)  "oo  ma  "OAomib  pin. 
Cio>  001b?  I  will  give  money  to  those  people.  To 
whom  ?     So  cé  pAoi,  why  ?  for  what,  lit.  what  for  it  ? 

2.  When  if  is  the  verb  of  the  sentence,  its  omission  results  in 

such  forms  as  cao  av  é,  cé  <ir  é  ?  where  is  he  from  ?  (cat> 
Ay  duit,  da,  etc.,  in  Munster  idiom,  v.  Syntax).  If  the 
verb  is  used  after  the  prepos.  and  relative,  §  146.     2.  C 


64        ' 

the  regular  forms  (cé  Af  Af\  Ah  é  ?  wh  mce  [from  what] 
is  he?  cé  "oe  A-p  [ao]  é?  of  what  [parents]  is  he 
[descended]),  become  by  use  of  prepositional  pronoun  as 
above,  cé  -ap  &h  Ay  é  ?  cia  ap  •oiob  é  ?  Two  difficult 
phrases. 

250.  What?  with  preposition  is  expressed  similarly : 
cat)  i?Á  a  Dcn^Air*  An  c-Ai|^eAT)  -oo,  why  did  you 
give  him  the  money  ?  in  S.  L.  cad  |:aoi  .  .  .  Cat) 
urn- a  bymlip  ...  is  now  cad  uime  a  br/tnliji. 

The  change  of  preposition  to  prepos.  pronoun  is  more  re- 
markable when  the  preposition  is  compound,  i.e.,  a  pre- 
positional phrase  ;  as,  CÁ  'n-a  cAob  ?  why  (Munst.),  lit., 
what  in  respect  of  it  ?  Cax>  map  jeabl  Aip  ?  For  what 
reason  ? 

251.  Other  pronominals. 

An  cé,  he  who,  the  person  whom.  Indeclinable. 
An  cé  bróeAp  pAn  moAi  le,  An  ué  hac  mbróeAnn  .  . ; 
x)o'n  cé  ó'n  cé,  a^  An  cé. 
11eAÓ,  gen.  neic,  a  person,  neAÓ  aj\  bic,  or  Aon-neAÓ, 
any  person,  -don  Dinne,  Aon  Jem,  are  also  used 
=  anyone. 

Ci^m  is  an  adjective  :  reAji  éigiri,  beAn  ei^m,  T>Aome 
015111 ;  a  certain  man,  woman,  certain  people.  (In 
S.  L.  it  takes  the  forms  éi^mc,  e  cine,  e  cíneAÓc, 
in  ceAC.) 

Curo,  a  portion,  is  used  =  some:  cun-o  x>e,  "mob,  aca, 
some  of  it,  of  them  ;  cui-o  -oe'n  ajuii,  some  of  the 
army.  Cibe  {lit.  =  whoever  it  be)  =  whosoever, 
whatsoever.  Cibé  beróeAr*  Ann,  whoever  shall  be 
there  ;  cibé  x)ume  beroeo.p  Ann,  whatever  person 
shall  be  there.  (Contracted  in  S.  L.  to  bé,  pé,  as 
pé  aca,  whichever,  whatever  of  them  {i.e.  — 
Munster  Anglo-Irish  "  whatever  "=)  at  all  events. 
So  pé  m  éinnin  é  (whoever,  whatever  in  Erin  it 
is)  at  any  rate.
