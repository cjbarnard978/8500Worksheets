on  nine  millions.  Giving  two  millions  of  these  to 
the  Germans,  French,  and  Italians  etc.,  leave  the 
Irish  seven  millions  wl)o  acknowledge  they  are  Ca- 
tholics out  of  the  twenty -.-fire  millions  of  the  ele- 
ment in  the  country  !  Where  are  the  other  seven- 
teen millions  Í  They  are  in  the  great  infidel  army, 
where  the  posterity  of  the  Irishman  who  would  not 
permit  his  son  to  learn  his  native  language  will  be 
if  they  cc'me  to  America,  With  England's  language, 
will  the  IsJand  of  Saints  become  the  nurse  of  infi- 
delity ?  Shade  of  McHale  look  down  and  pity  her  ! 
The  ghastly  picture  is  not  ours.     Contradict  it.

THE  BDHIAL  OF  SIR  JOHN  MOORE. 


Not  a  drum  wa'»  heard,  nor  a  funeral  note, 
As  his  i-orse  to  the  rampart  we  hurried  ; 

Not  a  8'ld'er  discha»gecl  his  farewell  shot 
O'er  tLe  grave  whtre  our  hero  we  buried. 

We  buri'  d  him  ('artly  at  dead  of  night, 

The  M  d  with  our  bayc.netf  turning. 
By  the  8'rugglÍDg  mooLbean  s'  m'sty  light, 

And  ihe  Idutern  dimly  burning. 

No  uf  e'es-i  coiRn  enolos'd  bis  breast, 

Not  ia  ^heet  or  iu  sliroud  we  bound  him  ; 

But  he  lay  like  a  wa'rior  takii  g  his  rest. 
With  his  maitial  cloak  around  him  1 

Few  and  short  were  the  prayers  we  said, 
And  we  spoke  not  a  word  of  sorrow  ; 

But  we  st^adfai-tly  gazt-d  on  the  face  of  the  dead, 
And  we  bitterly  thought  of  the  morrow. 

We  thought  as  we  hoUow'd  bis  narrow  bed, 

And  8Lu(nith'd  down  his  lonely  pillow.  he  d, 

That  tlie  f'e  and  t'  e  stranger  would  tread  o'er  Lis 
Aud  we  far  away  on  the  billow  ! 

Lightly  they'll  talk  of  the  spirit  that's  gone, 
And  o'er  liis  cold  ashes  upbraid  him. 

But  little  I  e'll  reck,  if  ttiey  lei  him  nleep  on— 
In  ti'e  grave  where  a  Biitun  Las  laid  ijim. 

B'lt  half  -ur  heavy  task  was  done, 

When  ti  e  ■  lock  struck  the  hour  for  reti  ing  : 

And  wt-  liei>rd  bv  ihe  distiut  and  rabdom  gun — 
ihat  the.  foe  VTaS  sullenly  fiiiug. 


Slowly  and  sadly  we  laid  him  down, 
From  the  field  of  his  fame  fresh  acd  gory  ; 

We  carved  not  a  line,  we  nised  not  a  stoiie — 
But  we  left  him  alone  with  his  glory  1 

The  following  are  clippings  from  the  Irish  World 
on  the  subject  of  the  song,  and  its  author,  sent  us 
by  the  translator. — 

Battle  of  Corukna  and  Burial  of  Sir  John 
Moore,  1809. —  On  the  scene  of  the  meniorable  bat 
tie  of  Corunna  on  the  Northwest  coast  of  Spain 
stands  a  beautiful  iijonument  to  commemorate  th« 
hero,  Sir  John  Moore,  who  fell  there  on  the  16th  <  f 
January,  1809,  while  fighting  at  bay  against  the 
puisuing  Freuch,  overwlom  he  won  avictory  which 
permitted  the  safe  embarkauon  of  his  army  home- 
ward. The  expedition  had  been  unfortunate  from 
the  beginning-  Acting  upon  the  ^epres^ntations  of 
of  the  English  and  Spanish  Ministers  they  bad  made 
a  bold  advance  toward  Madrid,  abd  they  were  forced 
to  retreat  to  the  coast  in  the  depth  of  Winter.  But 
the  commader,  Sir  John  Moore,  more  than  redeem- 
ed himself  any  censure  to  which  he  was  liable,  by 
the  skill  and  patience  with  which  he  conducted  the 
troops  on  tbeir  withdrawal  to  the  coast.  The  army 
was  in  great  wretchedness,  but  the  pursuing  French 
were  worse  ;  and  when  the  gallant  Moore  stood  at 
buy  at  Corunna,  he  gave  the  pursuers  a  thorough 
jepulse,  though  at  the  expense  of  his  own  life. 

The  hai  dsoibe  and  regular  feature  s  of  Moore  bear 
a  melancholy  expretsion  in  the  monument  ,  in  bar 
mony  with  bis  tfcte.  He  was  in  reality  an  admira- 
ble i-oldier.  He  bad  from  boyhood  devoted  himself 
to  his  profession  with  ex'reme  ardor,  and  his  w>  ole 
career  was  one  in  wbicib  duty  was  never  lost  s'ght 
of.  He  perished  at  th«^  too  early  age  of  47,  survived 
by  his  mother,  at  the  mention  <>f  wh-ise  name,  on 
his  deathsbed  he  manifested  the  only  s^atom  of  e- 
motion  which  escaped  Lim  in  that  frjing  h<  ur. 

The  scene  of  the  husiy  burial  of  the  fallen  hero 
wan  immortalized  by  tLe  Iiish  poet,  the  Eev. 

CHARLES  WOLFE, 

A  Frote'^tant  c'ergyflian,  who  was  born  in  Dublin, 
ou  tt  e  14t.b  of  Dec-mber.  1791.  He  was  educated  at

tributed, among  others,  to  Moo'e.  Campbell,  Wil- 
son, Byron,  and  Parry  Cornwell,  and  was  c'aimed 
by  more  than  one  obt-cure  writer.  It  was  only  after 
Wolfe's  death  that  the  chanre  discovery  of  a  letter 
(now  preserved  in  the  R'  yal  Irish  Acadamy)  in 
wh'ch  the  whole  n  given  in  hU  Landwritii  g  put  the 
matter  beyond  doubt.  Um  emitting  attention  to  his

Probably  there  is  no  other  people  iu  the  world  to- 
day whose  literary  education  is  so  perverted  as  that 
of  the  Irifah  Iris.!  men  and  Irish- Americans  of  tol- 
erably good  Engl'sh  edm  ation  have  nut  the  sligh  - 
es;  idea  that  the  exceipts  over  the  harp  ou  th  s  pao;e 
are  fac's.  On  the  contrary,  they  doubt  their  gen- 
uineness though  we  have  ^iven  the  authors,  and 
where  the  woiks  can  be  h&d.  Hence  our  crop  of 
Murphies  who  degiadu  and  disgrace  the  Irish  name, 
and  who  will  coLtinue  to  degrade  and  to  di^prace  it 
until  thev  are  properly  instructed  in  their  rights. 

Had  the  antecedents  of  the  defamers  of  the  Iri^h 
people  been  placed  before  the  populace  they  wouLi 
very  soon  hide  themseles  fn  m  the  public  view.  We 
make  no  war  on  Egli.-.hinen  or  "i^cotch  Irish", 
but  when,  in  their  ignorance  (>t  it  be  ignorance,  or, 
political  bluster,  or  enmity)  they  make  war  on  us, 
then  we  strike  back  by  simply  reminding  them  of 
who  and  what  they  are,  and  who  and  what  we  are, 
as  told  by  their  own  historians. 

Irish  Americans  are  the  greatest  goms  in  the 
world  to  day  to  allow  themselves  to  be  reviled  by 
their  nondescript  enemies  when  they  Lave  only  to 
circulate  and  point  to  the  above  extracts  (and  their 
language  and  literature)  to  silence  them  for  ever. 

Gaels,  do  you  circulate  these  extracts  and  poin 


out  your  lai^guage  and  literature  to  the  doubting 
Thomases,  and  then  the  number  of  the  vilifiers  of 
your  race  will  become  lees,  and  your  Murphies  will 
vanish. 

In  this  city  there  is  a  wellitnsdo  family  from  the 
suburbs  of  Belfast  who  pose  as  ''Scotchslrisb.''  The 
female  head  of  ttie  family  was  so  overbearing  that 
ber  -'common  Irish"  neighbors  could  not  stand  her- 
But,  in  course  of  time,  they  got  hold  oi  her  youthful 
history,  and,  on  the  first  opportunity  thereafter,  a 
sturdy  Mayo  woman,  wbom  she  attacked,  smilingly 

asked  her,   "Musha  Mrs what   about    Mr.   So 

and  So"?  The  virago  shut  up  as  if  btruck  by  light- 
ning, at  d  in  a  few  days  moved  to  another  part  of 
the  city.  What  is  the  moral  of  this — and  we  add- 
ress ourselves  to  all  Irishmen  Í  It  is  that  they  can 
effectually  shut  up  the  vilifiers  of  their  nation  by 
showing  up  what  they  are.  They  have  the  proof 
plainly  in  the  extracts  from  Spalding,  etc.,  with  the 
language  as  positive  evidence  ;  circulate  it !  Mrs. 
"Scotchslrish"  no  doubt  will  continue  her  course  in 
her  new  quarters;  bui- let  you  act  the  part  of  the 
plu  ky  Mayo  woman,  and  have  her  character  all 
over  by  »cattering  the  Gael  everywhere. 


THE   HERALD'S   BLAuKGUARDISM 

Of  all  the  caricatures  which  have 
come  to  our  notice  for  some  time,  ihat 
on  Mr  Ed  Murphy,  the  junior  United 
States  Senator  from  N  Y.  in  the  New 
York  Herald  of  Jan.  22nd,  is  the  most 
villainous,  for  it  is  leveled  not  at  Ed 
Murphy  but  at  the  element  of  which 
he  forms  a  part. 

In  enumerating  the  former  senators 
from  this  state,  exceptin»  the  Ifite  sen- 
ator Kernan  and  a  lew  others,  the  He- 
rald blackguard  represents  Ed.  Murphy 
jr  of  Tioy  underneath  them  (the  head 
being  represented  by  a  large  potato^  as 

"Our  New  Senator]" 
The  senators  enumerated  are,  Mor- 
ris, Van  Buren,  Marcy,  Fish,  Fen  ton, 
Seward,  Clinton,  King.  Dix,  Conklin, 
and  Ewarts,—  We  challenge  the  moral 
assassin  of  the  Herald  to  point  out 
Onei^^  the  above  list  who  is  the  supe- 
rior of  Ed  Murpby  in  social  National 
antecedents,  and  he  will  find  the  pedi- 
gree of  all  of  them  on  the  preceding 
column,  furnished  by  their  own  bigot- 
ed, anti-Irish  historians  William  Spal.

Hamilton  &  Co  ;  Edinburgh  Oliver  & 
Boyd,  a  work  t^o  popular  that  the  Thir- 
ty-seventh Edition,  published  in  1865, 
lies  before  us. 

Loi>k  across,  reader,  and  compare 
the  eminence  of  the  Irish,  as  a  people, 
with  the  semi.harbarous  condition  of 
their  would-be  social  assassins  ! 

Every  cornpr  loafer  who,  hy  bluff' 
and  bluster,  or  shady  means,  accumu- 
lates wealth  and  through  it  attains  to 
public  prominence,  never  ceases  to  vili- 
fy the  Irish  and  í-lap  them  in  the  face 
because  centuries  of  enforced  slavery 
Lave  unmanned  them,  otherwise  they 
would  cover  the  dead  walls  of  the  coun- 
tiy  with  the  pedigrees  of  the  lot  of  so 
cial  thieves  who  seek  their  material 
and  political  ruin. 

This  element  is  but  a  very  small  mi- 
nority ot  our  citizens  ;  but,  ha\iing  the 
power  and  money  of  England  at  their 
back,  they  control  the  piess  of  the  coun 
try  and  through  its  vilification  oi  an\ 
01-  all  who  come  in  their  way,  they  ga- 
ther in  the  fat  of  the  land — thus  further 
enabling  them  to  carry  on  their  viUai- 
nou.s  C(.nduct ;  and  all  this  they  do  un- 
d»r  tile  brazen  pretense  oi  their  being 
"the  better  element." 

This  gang  of  moral  assassins  cho.-e 
Grover  Cleveland  as  their  bend.  Wlio 
is  he?  His  biographers  tell  us  that  }iis 
mother  was  Annie  N-^al  (which  is,  sim- 
ply,O  Neil),  and  that  his  father's  name 
was  Cleveland,  which  name  people  say 
was  originally  Mc^Melland,  and  chang 
ed,  as  has  been  the  names  of  0  Conntll 
and  ()'Shaughnes>y  into  Cornell,  and 
Chauncey,  respectively,  in  this  city  in 
our  own  day. 

This  gangr  charged  Murphy  with  at- 
tending cock-fights  and  boxing  match- 
es ami  urged  that  fact  as  a  further  rea- 
son why  he  was  not  fit  for  the  office  of 
United  States  Senator  ;  and  here  their 
animus  forcibly  presents  itself,  for,  in 
these  regards,  Murphy  could  not  hold 
a  candle  to  their  idol,  the  British  crown 
prince,  whose  boots  they  would  think 
an  honor  to  blacken,— aye,  and  to  at> 


tend  to  other  little  wants  of  his  not  ne- 
cessary to  mention  here  but  the  nature 
of  which  the  intelligent  reader  fully 
comprehends  1 

For  Edward  Murphy  we  care  not  a 
straw.  He  is  merely  the  instrument 
through  which  his  nationality  has  been 
attacked.  We  concede  that  he  is  a 
mean  man,  as  are  all  the  other  Murph- 
ies who  permit  themselves  to  be  trod- 
den on  by  the  gang  of  political  skunks 
referred  to.  What  are  the  Murphies  a- 
Jraid  of?  Decent  men  would  not  Insult 
them  and  they  should  not  pei  mit  black, 
guards  to  do  it !  The  Murphy  incident 
mantles  the  brow  of  every  selfrespect- 
ing  man  of  Irish  blood  in  the  country 
with  the  blush  of  shame  to-day.  It  is 
well  for  the  Herald  blackguard  that  the 
object  of  his  blackguardism  was  not  a 
Frenchman  or  he  would  have  been  cow- 
hided  up  and  down  Broadway  from  the 
Batterj'  to  Harlem. 

This  is  the  way  the  Irish  element  has 
been  lost,  at  home  and  aboad.  They 
have  the  means  (their  ancient  flatter- 
ing, and  to  be  proud  of,  history)  to 
show  and  to  silence  their  detractors 
but  they  will  not  avail  themselves  of 
it  When  they  accumulate  wealth  they 
think  its  possession  will  guard  them 
against  the  poisonous  thrusts  of  the  e- 
nemies  of  their  race  and  nation,  but 
the  Murphy  incident  proves  that  it 
does  not,  and  that  manhood,  pi  oceeding 
from  a  sense  of  superiority,  would  be 
more  effective. 

Say;  Is  the  owner  of  the  Herald  who 
hobnobs  with  that  immaculate  (?)quan- 
tity,  called  English  "Society,*  any  bet- 
ter than  his  old  Scotch  father  who 
founded  the  l4x20  Herald  in  a  base- 
ment in  Fulton  s  reet?  is  ex  Secreta- 
ry V\  hitney  any  better  than  when  he 
hunted  for  a  fee  to  buy  his  dinner?  Is 
ex-Mayor  Grace  any  better  than  when 
he  attended  to  his  butcher  shop?  And 
is  President-elect  Cleveland  any  better 
than  when  he  was  sheriff  of  Erie  coun. 
ty,  a  then  petty  oflSce  which  only  a 
hungry  lawyer  would  accept  7  And  so 
of  the  rest  of  them.  The  mechanic  who

earns  his  day's  wages  is  as  good  as 
they,  and  as  trustworthy — a  fact  that 
he  should  always  bear  in  mind.  Res- 
pectability of  conduct  and  not  money 
constitute  ''the  better  element." 


We  extract  the  folic  wing  from  No.  43  of  the 
Dublin  Gaelic  Journal  (abbreviated). — 

A  society  is  formed  in  Dublin  called  the  New 
National  Literary  Society  of  which  Craoibhin 
Aoibhinn  is  president. 

According  to  the  last  census  250,000  people  in 
Scotland  use  the  Gaelic  as  their  only  language, 
and  41, COO  use  no  other  language. 

Ther^  are  districts  in  Canada,  Prince  Edward'» 
Island.  Cape  Breton,  and  Glergarry,  where  the  po- 
pulation is,  to  a  large  extflnt,  Gaelic-epeaking. 

In  the  Highland  Monthly  (Inverriesi-),  Mr.  Mac 
Kenzie  continues  to  publish  his  collection  of  olu 
charms  and  incantations. 

The  Celtec  ilíoní^  ?/ is  1  he  latest  literary  vent 
nre  of  our  Higi^land  Gaelic  frierds.  Ihe  yearly 
subscripti  n  is  Ss,,  and  the  editm  and  m  rager  M» 
John  Mackay,  17  Dundas  St.,  Kingston,  Giasgcw. 

641,968  speak  Irish  in  Ireland,  and  38,189  speak 
no  other  language. 


The  following  colleges  atd  Cfcriftian  Brotbeib' 
Schools  tench  ibe  language  with  zeal  and  tnccesf, 

The  College  of  Clongowes,  Newry,  Blacrock,

friends,  we  hope  the  above  Colleges  and  Christiau

they  are  the  Gaelic  reservoirs  of  the  future.

ON  THE

TORY. 


LECTURE  VII. 
[Delivered  July  3,  1856. 


This  last  part  of  the  Annals  wa.'^  evidently  inten 
ded  to  be  a  history  ;  but  it  is  clear  that  the  first, 
perhaps  for  'he  reason  I  ha'  e  just  stated,  was  not 
intended  to  be  anything  Doore  tlian  a  skeleton.  t'> 
be  at  some  future  time  clothed  with  flf'sh  and  blo^d 
from  the  large  stock  of  materials  which  might  still 
remain,  and  which  in  fflct  has  remained  to  the  Suc- 
cessors of  the  Four  Masters  ;  and  the  exact  value 
of  the-e  maerials  in  reference  to  a  corrplete  histo- 
ry will  be  01- eu  when,  in  a  ftiture  lecture,  we  come 
to  deal  with  the  historical  ta'es  and  other  detailed 
compositioDS  containing  the  minute  occurrence's  of 
life,  arid  the  lesser  «nd  more  unimportant  but  still 
most  interesting  fa^ts  of  history  in  the  early  ages 
of  the  country. 

You  have  already  h^ard  in  the  quotations  from 
Dr.  O'Conor,  the  opinions  of  the  learned  but  scep 
tical  Pinkerton,  on  the  antiquity  of  our  monarchy 
and  the  general  authenticity  of  our  history  ;  let  me 
now  read  you  the  opiuion  of  another  •■"cctchman, 
in  no  way  inferior  to  him  in  general  literary  know- 
ledge, profound  research,  and  Hccurate  dÍFcrimina. 
tion.  I  mean  Sir  James  Mackintosh,  who,  having 
become  acquainted  with  the  character  af  these  An- 
nals from  Dr.  0'C'>nor's  very  inaccurate  Latin 
translation  of  the  early  part  of  them  down  to  1170, 
accords  his  fi'vorabie  opinion  of  them  in  the  follow 
ing  words  : — 

"The  Chronicles  of  Ireland,  written  in  the  Irish 
language  from  the  second  century  to  the  landing 
of  Henry  Plantagenet,  have  been  recently  publish 
ed  with  the  fullest  evidence  of  their  genuineness. 
The  Irish  nation,  though  they  are  robbed  of  tteir 
legends  by  this  authentic  publication,  are  yet  by 
it  enabled  to  boast  that  they  possess  gennice  his- 
tory several  centuries  more  ancient  than  any  other 
European  nation  possesses  in  its  present  spoken 
language,  They  have  exchanged  their  legendary 
antiquity  for  historical  fame.  Indeed  no  other  na- 
tion possesses  any  monument  of  literature  in  its 
present  spoken  language,  ^hich  goes  baf>k  within 
several  centuries  of  these  Chronicles''. — History  of 
-England,  vol.  i..  chap.  2. 

Moore,  who  was  less  profound  as  an  historian, 
and,  consequently,  more  sceptical,  remarks  on  this 
passage, — "With  the  exception  of  the  mistake  in 
to  which  Sir  Jas.  Mackintosh  has  here,  rather  un- 
accountably, been  led,  in  supposing  that,  among 
the  written  Irish  Chronicles  which  have  come 
down  to  ug,  there  are  any  so  early  as  the  second 
century,  the  tribute  paid  bv  him  to  the  authentici- 
ty and  h  storical  importance  of  these  documents 
appears  to  me  in  the  highest  degree  deserved,  and 
comes  with  more  authority  Irom  a  writer,  whose 
command  over  the  wide  domain  of  history  enablpd 
him  fully  to  appreciate  any  genuine  addition  to  it ' 
— History  of  Ireland,  vol.  i. ,  p.  168. 

The  poet,  however,  lived  to  doubt  his  own  com- 
petence to  offer  such  a  criticism  on  the  chronicles 
of  his  native  country.  The  first  volume  of  his  his- 
tory was  published  in  the  year  1835,  and  in  the 
year  1839,  daring  one  of  his  last  visits  to  the  land 


of  his  birth,  he,  in  company  with  his  old  iriend. 
Dr.  Petrie  favoured  me  with  quite  an  unexpected 
visit  at  the  Royal  Irish  Academy,  then  in  Grafton 
Street.  I  was  at  that  time  employed  on  the  ord- 
nance suri^ey  of  Ireland  ;  and,  at  the  time  of  his  vi- 
sit, happened  to  have  before  me,  on  my  desk,  the 
Rooks  of  Ballvmote  and  Lecain.  the  Leabhar 
Breac,  the  Annals  of  the  Four  Masters,  and  many 
other  ancient  books,  for  historical  research  and  re- 
ference. I  had  nevr  bef<  re  seen  Moore,  and  after 
a  brief  int'oduction  and  explanation  of  the  nature 
of  my  occupation,  b_^  Dr.  Petrie,  and  seeing  the 
formidable  array  of  so  many  dark  ani  timesworn 
v'lumf  8  by  which  I  was  surrounded,  he  looked  a 
little  dif-C()Uce!tKJ,  but  after  a  «bile  plucked  up 
courage  to  open  tl  e  Book  of  Ballyuiote,  and  ask 
what  it  was.  Dr.  Petrie  and  mjst-if  then  entered 
into  a  fhort  explanati.  n  if  the  history  aiid  charac- 
ter of  the  books  tnen  present,  as  well  as  ancient 
Gaedhlic  d(  cuments  in  general.  M(  ore  listened 
with  great  atteition.  alternately  scanning  the 
books  and  myself;  and  then  asked  me,  in  a  f-erious 
tone,  if  I  understo'd  them,  and  how  I  learned  to 
do  so.  Hav'ng  satisfied  him  on  these  points,  he 
turned  to  Dr.  Petrie,  aid  said:  "Petrie,  these 
huge  tomes  could  not  have  been  written  by  fools 
or  for  any  foolish  purpose.  I  never  knew  anything 
about  them  before,  and  I  had  no  right  to  have  un 
dertaken .the  Hi^tory  of  Ireland."  Three  volumes 
of  big  history  bad  been  before  this  time  published, 
and  it  is  quite  possible  that  ii  was  the  new  light 
which  appeared  to  havt-  broken  in  upon  him  on 
this  oecason,  that  had  him  from  putting  his  fourth 
Bnd  last  volume  to  press  until  after  several^years  ; 
it  is  believed  he  was  only  compelled  to  do  so  at 
)aet  by  his  publishers  in  1846. 

I  may  be  permitted  here  to  observe  that  what 
Sir  James  Mackintosh  and  other  great  writers 
speak  of  so  lightly,  as  the  "legendary"  history  of 
Ireland,  is  capable  of  authentic  elucidation  to  an 
extent  far  beyond  what  they  believed  or  supposed 
them  to  be,  &"  would  both  please  and  satisfy  that 
distinguished  writer  and  philosopher  himself,  as 
well  as  all  other  candid  investigators. 

Of  the  Annals  of  the  Four  Masters,  no  perfect 
copy  of  the  autograpLi  is  now  known  to  exist,  tho' 
the  parts  of  them,  so  strangely  scattered  in  ditfer- 
ent  localities  throughout  Euroi^:e,  would  make  one 
perfect  copy,  and  another  nearly  perfect 

To  begin  at  home,  the  Royal  Irish  Academy 
holds,  among  its  other  treasures  of  ancient  Irish 
literature,  a  perfect  original — I  might  say,  the  ori- 
ginal— autograph  copy  of  the  Second  Part  of  these 
Annals,  from  the  jear  1170,  imperfect,  to  the  year 
1616 

The  library  of  Trinity  College,  Dublin,  also  con 
tains  a  part  of  an  autograph  copy,  beginnii  g  with 
the  year  133.5,  and  ending  with  the  year  1603. 

Of  the  part  precedmg  1171,  there  are  also  two  dif 
fert-nt  copies  in  existence,  but  unfortunately  bey- 
ond the  reach  of  collation  or  useful  examinati'-  n. 
Of  these,  one — which,  a  few  years  ago,  and  for 
some  years  previously,  belonged  to  the  great  libra- 
ry of  the  Duke  of  Buckingham  at  Slowe — has  pass 
ed  by  sale  into  the  collection  of  Lord  Ashburn- 
ham,  where,  with  the  other  Irish  manuscripts  that 
accompanied  it,  it  is  very  safely  preserved  from  ex 
amination,  lest  an  actual  acquaintance  with  their 
contents  should,  in  the  opinion  of  the  very  noble- 
Euiuded  owner,  decrease  their  value  as  mere  mat 
ters  of  curiosity  at  some  future  transfer  or  sale. 

How  unfortunate  and  fatal  that  this  volume,  as

well  as  the  other  Irish  manuscripts  which  nccom- 
pany  it,  and  the  most  part  of  ^^hich  were  bat  lent 
to  the  Stowe  librery,  should  have  passed  from  the 
inaccessible  shelves  of  that  once  princBly  establish 
ment  into  another  asylum  equally  secure  and  un- 
approai  hable  to  auy  scholar  of  the  "mere  Irish"  ! 

At  the  time  of  the  advertised  sale  of  the  Stowe 
library,  in  1849,  the  British  Museum  made  every 
effort  to  become  the  pnrchasers,  with  the  consent 
and  support  of  the  Treasury,  through  Sir  Robert 
Peel  ;  but  the  trustees  delated  so  long  on  deteimi 
niijg  what  should  be  Houe,  thai  the  sale  took  place 
privately,  and  the  whole  collection  was  earriel  off 
and  incarcerated  in  a  mansion  some  sevetity  miles 
fiom  LoL'don. 

The  late  Sir  Robprt  Inglis  and  Lord  Broughim 
were,  I  bKlieve,  most  anxious  to  have  this  collect- 
iv^n  deposited  in  the  British  Museum  ;  but  Mr. 
(now  Lord)  Maeauley,  the  Essayist,  having  been 
among  the  Museum  Trustees  who  examined  it,  de- 
clared that  he  saw  nothing  in  the  whDle  worth 
purchasing  for  the  Museum,  but  the  correspond- 
ence of  Lord  Melville,  a  Scotch,  nobleman,  on  the 
American  war  I 

The  second  original  copy  of  this  first  part  is, 
but  owing  only  to  its  distance  from  us,  as  inaccess- 
ible as  the  one  in  Ashburnham  House.  It  is  in  the 
Irish  College  of  St  Iwadore  in  R  me.  The  disoov 
ery  of  this  volume  there,  and  of  the  important  col- 
lection of  manuBcripis,  Gaedhlic  and  Latin,  of 
which  it  forms  a  part,  was  made  by  the  late  learn- 
ed and  lamented  Dean  Lyons,  of  BelmuUet,  in  the 
County  of  Mayo,  in  the  years  1842  and  1843.  This 
learned  priest,  having  ocasion  to  fpend  some  con- 
siderable part  of  those  years  in  Rome,  was  request 
ed  at  his  departure,  by  some  friends  of  Irish  litera 
ture  in  Dublin,  to  examine,  sluiuld  time  permit 
him,  the  great  literary  repositories  of  the  Eternal 
City,  and  to  bring,  or  send  home,  tracings  of  any 
ancient  Giedhlic  manuscripts  which  he  might  have 
the  goodfortune  lo  light  upoi  .  He  accordingly,  on 
the  Irit  of  June,  J 842,  wrote  home  a  letter  to  the 
Rev.  Dr.  Todd  and  to  Dr.  O'Donovan  apprising 
them  that  he  had  discovered,  in  the  College  of  8t 
Isadore,  several  ancient  Gaedhlic  and  Latiu  manu- 
scripts, which  formerly  belonged  to  Ireland  and 
to  Irishmen  ;  and  on  the  Ist  of  July  in  the  ensuing 
year  of  1843,  he  addressed  a  letter  to  the  same  part 
ies  on  the  same  subject.  These  letters  contained  ac 
curate  descriptions  of  the  condition  and  extent  of 
the  Gaedhlic  MSH.,  together  with  tracings  from 
their  contents,  sufficient  to  enable  me  to  identify 
the  chief  part  of  them. 

Among  these  MSS.  at  .'^t  Isadore's.  there  was 
found  an  autograph  of  the  first  part  of  the  Annals 
of  the  Four  Masters,  coming  d'Wn  to  the  year 
1169,  with  the  "Approbations"  and  all  the  prefato- 
ry matter.  This  is  the  only  autograph  of  the  first 
part  now  known,  save  that  formeJy  at  8towe  ;  and 
both  being  inaccessible  at  the  time  of  the  publica 
tiou  of  the  whole  work  *  few  years  ago,  the  learn 
ed  and  nbln  *dit'  r,  Dr.  O'Donovan,  was  obliged  to 
use  Dr.  O'C  nor's  inaccurate  version,  only  correct- 
ing it  by  modern  copies  here,  as  may  be  seen  in 
his  introduction. 

The  novel  and  important  difcovery  of  this  col- 
lection excited  so  great  a  degree  of  interest  in  Dub 
lin  at  the  time,  that  a  subscription  for  their  pur- 
chase, sbculditbe  found  practicable,  was  freely 
jjud  warmly  talked  of 

Upon  the  return  of  Dr.  Lyons  to  Ireland,  Dr. 
Todd  opened  a  correspondence  with  him  as  to  his 


views  of  the  possibility  of  the  authorities  in  Rome 
consenting  to  the  sale  of  these  MSS.  Dr.  Lyons'g 
answer  was  encouraging,  and  in  order  to  prepare 
him  for  bringing  the  matter  before  the  proper  par- 
ties, he  requested  that  I  should  draw  up  a  short 
paper  upon  their  contents,  the  importance  of  hav- 
ing them  here  at  home,  and  the  intrinsic  value  of 
the  whole  according  to  the  rate  at  which  GaedhUo 
manuscripts  were  estimated  and  sold  in  Dublin  at 
the  time. 

This  paper,  or  letter,  was  transmitted  to  Rome 
at  the  time  by  Dr.  L^ODS  ;  but  his  own  lamented 
death  occurring  shortly  after,  the  correspondence 
through  that  channel  was  interrupted,  and  the  fam 
ine  having  set  in  about  the  same  time,  the  spirit  of 
the  country  was  checked,  objects  of  more  immediate 
importance  pressed  themselves  on  the  mindy  of  men 
and  the  subject  was  forgotten  for  a  time.  There 
are,  howevr,  in  Dublin  a  fow  patriotic  men,  who, 
within  the  last  two  years,  have  offered  a  handsome 
sum  of  money  from  their  private  purses  for  those 
manuscripts  for  public  purposes  ;  but  they  seem 
not  to  have  been  able  to  convey  their  proposal 
through  an  eligible  channel,  and  so  no  satisfactory 
result  has  followed  their  laudable  endeavours. 

I  may  perhaps  be  pardoned  for  adding  here,  that 
the  short  catalogue  of  the  St  Isadore  manuscripts 
which  I  drew  up  for  Dean  Lyons,  and  which  he 
transmitted  to  Rome,  was  .-ubsequently  published 
without  acknowledgment,  by  the  Rev.  J.  Donovan 
in  the  third  volume  of  his  ''Ancient  and  Modern 
Rome." 

To  resume.  It  will  be  remembered  that  in  Mi- 
chael O'Clery's  address  to  Fergal  O'Gara  he  pays 
him,  along  with  many  others,  the  following  com- 
pliment : — 

"  For  every  good  that  will  result  from  this  book 
in  giving  light  to  the  neople  in  general,  it  is  to  you 
that  thanks  should  be  given,  there  should  exist  no 
wonder  or  surprise,  jealousy,  or  envy  at  any  good 
that  Tou  do,  for  you  are  of  the  race  of  Eber  Mao 
Mileadh",  etc.,  etc. 

On  this  passage  thg  editor.  Dr.  Donovan,  com- 
ments unnecessarily,  I  think,  in  the  following 
words, — 

"If  O'Donnell  were  in  the  country  at  the  time, 
be  ought  to  have  felt  great  envy  and  jealousy  that 
the  Four  Masters  should  have  committed  this  work 
which  treats  of  the  O'Donnells  more  than  of  any 
family,  to  the  world  under  the  name  and  patronage 
of  any  of  the  rival  race  of  OilioU  Oluim,  much  lees 
to  so  petty  a  chieftain  of  that  race  as  O'Gara.  This 
will  appear  from  the  Contention  of  the  Bards." 

Nothing,  however,  appears  more  obvious  from 
the  Contention  of  the  Bards,  than  (as  I  have  alrea- 
dy shown  and  as  is  proved  by  Ann/uain  Mac 
Agan's  acknowledgment)  that  the  northern  Bards 
were  worsted  in  the  contest  ;  and  nothing  has  been 
put  forward  to  show  O'Donuell's  superior  claims  to 
the  patronage  of  a  historical  work,  but  that  his 
own  family  figures  more  corspicuonsly  in  it  thaa 
any  other  of  the  nation.  This  argument,  however, 
on'inquiry,  will  scarcely  be  found  to  hold  good, 
and  before  I  pats  on  it  may  perhaps  be  worth  while 
to  answer  it  at  once  by  referring  t'>  some  few  statis- 
tics of  family  names  occurring  in  these  Annals. 
(To  be  continued)

old  (though  young  in  years)  friend,  Mr  T  Lyons, 
Jersey  City,  paid  us  a  friendly  visit,  and,  before 
he  left,  paid  his  usual  substantial  subscription,  and 
also,  to  Lave  the  Gael  sent  for  a  year  to  his  old  in- 
structor in  the  rudiments  of  Gealie  literature,  Mr. 
Luke  Comer,  Stonetown  N.  School,  Glennamaddy, 
Co.  Galway,  Mr.  Lyons,  liktj  his  brother  J  J,  of 
Philadelphia,  is  a  fiood  Gaelic  writer.  We  hope 
others  will  follow  Mr  Lyons's  example.  Irishman 
have  in  The  Gael  the  opportunity  of  their  lives  to 
place  themselves  in  their  propir  light  before  the 
world.  The  cost  individually  is  light,  and  we  pro- 
mise them  if  they  render  it  that  we  will  not  let 
their  social  bone  go  with  the  dogs — we  have  the 
pri  of  and  the  backsbone  to  use  it— sparicg  none
