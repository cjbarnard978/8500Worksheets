PEEPACE. 


Miss  Stokes,  in  an  interesting  essay,  has  lately  described  a 
piece  of  gold-work,  which  she  believes  to  be  a  fragment  of  an 
ancient  Irish  crown.  In  reading  the  text  of  Dindsenchas,  con- 
tained in  the  recently  published  facsimile  of  the  '  Book  of  Lein- 
ster,'  I  came  across  this  short  tale,  which  tells  of  the  loss  of  a 
crown  perhaps  as  magnificent  as  that  on  which  Miss  Stokes  has 
shown  so  much  artistic  skill  and  antiquarian  research. 

The  precise  date  of  the  text  is  undetermined.  It  is  probably 
not  later  than  a.d.,  1200.  The '  Dindsenchas  '  is  an  ancient  collec- 
tion of  tales  about  Irish  localities  ;  and  this  part  of  it  has  not  been 
printed  before.  Laeghaire  Lore,  as  is  told  by  Keating,  was  slain 
by  his  brother  at  Dinn-rigb,  on  the  banks  of  the  river  Barrow. 
The  brother,  by  advice  of  a  Druid,  feigned  illness  and  lay  in  a 
litter.  Laeghaire  Lore  came  unarmed,  and  was  stabbed  while 
bending  over  him.  Cobthach,  the  murderer,  slew  other  members 
of  the  king's  family,  and  compelled  his  nephew  to  eat  parts  of 
the  hearts  of  his  father  and  grandfather.  In  the  midst  of  such 
ferocity  it  may  easily  be  imagined  that  the  ornaments  of  the 
murdered  king  were  flung  into  a  lake  to  save  them  from  falling 
into  the  hands  of  the  usurper.  I  do  not  know  the  source  of 
Keating's  story,  but  it  seems  to  be  part  of  the  same  romance  as 
the  somewhat  bald  statement  in  the  '  Dindsenchas.' 

The  text  is  taken  from  p.  168,  col.  2,  of  the  facsimile,  of  which 
it  occupies  the  last  seven  lines.  Tbe  mark  of  aspiration,  and 
tbe  well  known  characters  for  air  and  ar,  are  printed  without 
note,  but  all  other  interpretations  of  contractions  are  marked  by 
italics. 

I  was  unable  to  construe  the  two  words  which  end  the  first 
line  of  the  verse,  and  I  owe  their  explanation  to  the  kindness  of 
Mr.  W.  M.  Hennessy.  With  his  usual  courtesy  he  took  the 
trouble  to  collate  the  line  with  the  original,  and  wrote  me  the 
valuable  note  which  I  have  printed  in  the  vocabulary. 

In  the  vocabulary  I  have  added  a  few  illustrations.  Those 
without  a  reference  are  from  notes  of  my  own  of  expressions  in 
use  at  the  present  day.  Every  alphabetically  arranged  collection 
of  words  has  its  use,  and  my  excuse  for  printing  so  small  a 
fragment  is  that  it  is  an  illustration  of  tbe  elaborate  paper  which 
is  the  latest  of  Miss  Stokes's  numerous  contributions  to  the 
study  of  Irish  art.

Annals,  in  two  contests  for  the  succession  to  Armagh, 
and  died  in  a.d.  794.  It  seems  possible  that  the 
explanation  oinmitt  oaf  ('  Corm.  Trans.,'  p.  81)  may- 
have  been  applied  to  the  name  by  some  writer  of  an 
opposing  faction,  and  that  it  has  thus,  as  has  happened

loegaire,  name  of  a  man ;  gen.  sg. 

luad,  gen.  pi.  of  luad,  mention,  praise.  "  In  the  original 
the  words  are  linib  luad,  which  are  words  frequently 
introduced  into  Irish  poems  as  meaningless  padding  to 
fill  up  a  line,  like  tolam  Set,  tolaib  gal,  digrais 
dend,  milib  mod,  &c.  The  words  linib  luad,  how- 
ever, have  an  abstract  meaning  in  themselves,  though, 
as  I  have  said,  merely  used  in  your  extract  to  fill  up  a 
line,  linib  is  the  ablative  (or  dat.)  plural  of  lin,  a 
part,  a  number,  a  quantity,  and  luad  is  the  gen.  pi.  of 
luad,  mention,  praise,  &c.  linib  luad  would  there- 
fore signify  :  with  numbers  (or  multitudes)  of  praises. 
The  words  do  not  refer  to  any  characteristic  of  the 
lake  of  which  the  poet  was  writing.  Like  the  other 
fill-gaps  to  which  I  refer  the  first  word  of  the  formula 


is  usually  put  in  the  ablative  case  and  chiefly  in  the 
plural,  and  one  may  suppose  a  preposition  understood, 
as  (co)  tolaib  gal  (with)  floods  of  deeds/' — Letter  from 
Mr.  TV.  M.  Hennessy,  Dublin,  January  3rd,  1881.
