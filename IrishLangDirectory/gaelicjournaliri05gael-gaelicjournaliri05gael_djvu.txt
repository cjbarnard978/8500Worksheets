1.  She  through  the  whins,  and  by  the  cairn 
And  owre  the  hill  gaed  scricvin, 
Whare  three  lairds'  lands  meet  at  a  burn, 
To  dip  her  left  sark-sleeve  in. 

Was  bent  that  night. 

2.  They  hoy't  out  Will,  wi'  sair  advicg  ; 
They  hecht  him  some  fine  braw  ane  ; 

It  chanced  the  stack  he  faddom't  thrice, 
Was  limmer-propt  for  thrawin';—

And  to  the  kiln  she  goes  then. 

And  darklins  graipit  for  the  banks,

Right  fear't  that  night. 
And  aye  she  win't,  and  aye  she  swat,

And  he  swore  by  his  conscience, 
That  he  could  saw  hemp-seed  a  peck, 
For  it  was  a'  but  nonsense. 

The  auld  guidman  raught  down  the  pock. 
And  out  a  handfu'  gied  him  ; 
Syne  bade  him  slip  frae  'maiig  the  folk, 
Sometime  when  nae  ane  see'd  him, 

And  try't  that  night.

Brian  Boroimhe  before  his  Last 

Battle. 

By  Rev.  J.  J.  O'Carroll,  S.J. 

{Translation.) 

Brian. — Great  is  the  power  my  hand  doth 

wield  to-da\- ; 
Great  is  my  glor)-  in  our  Irish  land  ; — 
Yet  greater  is  the  pain  that  gnaws  my  heart 
Than    power,   or   praise   of   men.    I    have 

brought  low 
The  race  that  held  the  sceptre  over  Erin 
From  age  to  age  till  I  arose.     Nor  did  I 
Subdue  on  battle-fields  alone  their  clans  : — 
They  are  become  my  followers  !     On  this 

spot, 
Before  the  haughty  city  of  the  Danes, 
Stand  the  Ui-Neill  in  array  beside  me. 
And  at  my  right  hand,  Malachy  himself, 
The  man  from   whom  I  tore  the  crown  of 

Erin, 
Is  ready  to  do  battle  at  my  call. 
As  bravely  as  when,  leading  on  the  hosts, 
His  strong  sword  won  the  early  victory 
Over  the  golden-collared  Danish  king. 
No  longer  can   the  Danes  withstand  m)- 

power. 


My  victory  is  certain  now.     It  will 

Be  great.    It  will  be  famed  and  glorious  too. 

For  with  the  courage  of  despair  the  Danes 

will  fight. 
There  shall  be'glory  round  this  battle-day 
Such  as  was  never  known  for  war  in  Erin  ; 
And  in  the  ages  that  are  yet  to  come 
Its  name  and  story  shall  be  sweet  to  hear, 
Till  even  men  that  cannot  speak  our  tongue 
Shall   sing  of  and    shall    bless    Clontarf's 

bright  day. 
Fair,  hopeful  day,  Erin  shall   call  her  own  ! 
Most  glorious  day,  when  falls  for  evermore 
The  pirate  empire  over  land  and  seas  ! 

Yet  in  this  hour.of  honour  full  and  might, 
M\-  heart  can   find   no  peace.     One  great 

dread  fear 
Pursues  me,  that  I  did  what  was  not  just 
In  raising  up  my  power  to  this  high  state. 
Perhaps    this    strong    right    hand    seems 

stained  with  guilt 
To  the  clear  ej'cs  of  God,  and  therefore  now. 
Perhaps  in  ver)-  hour  of  victory, 
His  vengeance  will  descend  upon  my  head.

THE  OSSIANIC  POEMS. 
By  Rev.  John  James  O'Carroli.,  S.J. 

I. 

The  works  selected  by  the  Intermediate 
Education  Commissioners  for  examination 
in  Celtic,  in  the  first  year  of  their  Board's 
existence,  were  all  prose  tales,  and  were 
discussed  in  several  articles  in  the  earlier 
numbers  of  the  third  and  latest  series  of 
the  /n's/i  Ecclesiastical  Record.  But  the 
volumes  of  the  Ossianic  Society  from  which 
those  tales  were  taken  contained  poems 
too,  and  the  poems  seem  to  have  a  still 
greater  claim  upon  attention  than  the  tales 
in  prose.  They  are  poems  of  the  kind 
which  the  reader  would  most  naturally 
expect,  and  which,  so  far  as  extrinsic  con- 
siderations go,  would   certainly   have   the 


greatest  attraction  for  him — poems  in  which 
Ossian  himself  appears  as  the  principal 
narrator.  The  Irish  poems  of  this  kind 
must  not  be  supposed  to  have  been  un- 
known to  James  Macpherson.  He  even 
went  so  far  as  to  pronounce  literary  criti- 
cism upon  them  ;  and  our  neglected  Irish 
literature  has  been  so  little  favoured  with 
notice  of  any  kind,  that  we  are  only  too 
glad  to  have  even  Macpherson's  unfavour- 
able judgment  to  lay  before  the  reader,  as 
an  introduction  to  the  Irish  Ossianic  poems. 
It  is  important  from  the  outset  to  have  a 
clear  idea  of  the  position  which  this  famous 
man  took  up.  He  did  not  deny  the  exist- 
ence in  Ireland  of  many  Ossianic  poems, 
that  is  (to  repeat  once  more  what  ought  to 
be  the  definition  of  this  term)  poems  in 
which  Ossian,  the  son  of  Fionn,  appears  as 
the  principal  narrator.  When  David  Hume, 
in  his  interesting  and  amusing  letter  to  Dr. 
Blair  proposing  a  test*  to  try  Macpherson's 
poetry,  relates  that  "  Bourke  {sic),  a  very 
ingenious  Irish  gentleman,"  "  the  author  of 
a  tract  on  the  Sublime  and  Beautiful,"  has 
told  him  how  Mr.  Bourke's  Irish  country- 
men, on  becoming  acquainted  with  Mr. 
Macpherson's  publication  of  "  Ossian,"  ex- 
claimed that  "Ossian"  was  theirs,  and  that 
"Ossian"  was  old,  and  that  they  had 
known  "Ossian"  a  long  time;  poor  James 
Macpherson  might  have  fairly  answered 
that  his  "  Ossian"  was  not  exactly  their  old 
acquaintance,  but  in  his  opinion  a  far 
superior  person.  Neither  did  Macpherson 
maintain  that  his  "  Ossian  "was  commonly 
known  in  the  Highlands  of  Scotland,  in 
contradistinction  to  the  more  vulgar 
"Ossian"  of  the  neighbouring  island.  When 
Shaw  bore  the  remarkable  testimony  which 
we  find  quoted  by  our  Ossianic  Society — 


*  Hume  has  a  reputation  for  logic,  but  he  seems  to 
have  reasoned  curiously  about  Macpherson.  He  re- 
presents him  as  certamly  wrongheaded,  and  almost  next- 
door  to  insane,  for  not  choosing  to  submit  to  careful  inves- 
tigation when  his  veracity  was  impeached.  And  at  the 
same  lime,  to  put  the  matter  very  miklly,  Hume  seems  to 
think  it  at  least  quite  possible  that  the  impeachment  was 
only  too  well-founded.  Surely  if  that  hypothesis  was 
really  the  case,  Macpherson  would  have  had  to  be  wrong- 
headed  and  next-door  to  insane,  indeed,  to  be  willing  to 
consent  to  a  careful  investigation  of  his  statements. 
To  affect  passion  and  indignation  would  then  have  been 
to  follow  the  dictates  of  a  cool  and  calculating  temper. 


THE   GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


"  Fionn  is  not  known  in  the  Highlands  by 
the  name  of  Fingal  ;  he  is  universally  sup- 
posed to  be  an  Irishman.  When  I  asked 
some  of  the  Highlanders  who  Fionn  was, 
they  answered,  an  Irishman,  if  a  man,  for 
they  sometimes  thought  him  a  giant  ;  and 
that  he  lived  in  Ireland,  and  sometimes 
came  over  to  hunt  in  the  Highlands  :" — 
Wacpherson  might  have  said  he  had  fully 
admitted  that  Irish  Ossianic  literature  was 
current  in  the  Scottish  Highlands.  His  real 
point  was  that  the  Irish  Ossianic  litera- 
ture, well  known  to  Irishmen  and  to  High- 
landers, was  recent  and  debased,  and  that 
he  had  been  so  fortunate  as  to  discover 
ancient  Scottish  poems,  similar  in  subject, 
undebased  and   wholly  beautiful  in  form.* 

Those  who  take  an  unfavourable  view  of 
his  veracity  will  probably  be  inclined  to  say, 
that  in  the  current  Irish  literature  he  had 
been  charmed  by  the  sentiment,  and 
shocked  by  the  pictures  of  manners  and 
Druidic  quaint  mythology  ;  they  will  re- 
mind us  that  he  closes  his  preface  to 
"Temora"  with  the  following  passage: 
"  The  bards  of  Ireland  have  displayed  a 
genius  worthy  of  any  age  or  nation.  It  was 
alone  in  matters  of  antiquity  that  they 
were  monstrous  in  their  fables.  Their  love 
sonnets  and  their  elegies  on  the  death  of 
persons  worthy  or  renowned,  abound  with 
such  beautiful  simplicity  of  sentiment  and 
wild  harmony  of  numbers,  that  they  become 
more  than  an  atonement  for  their  errors  in 
every  other  species  of  poetr\-.  But  the 
beauty  of  these  pieces  depend  (i/r-f-)  so  much 
on  a  certain  curiosa  felicitas  of  expression 
in  the  original,  that  they  must  appear  much 
to  disadvantage  in  another  language." 

It  will,  in  fine,  be  suggested  that  Mac- 


*  We  think  one  simple  quotation  will  here  throw  vivid 
light  upon  the  state  of  things  in  Scotl.aiid  with  regard 
to  Ossianic  poetry.  In  his  letter  of  the  23rd  January, 
1764.  published  by  the  "  Highland  Committee- "  which 
was  fíMined  to  e.xamine  into  tlie  authenticity  of  Macpher- 
son's  Ossian.  Mr.  Neil  MacLeod,  minislcr  of  Ross,  writes 
as  follows  :  "  I  examined  all  the  periOns  in  this  or  the 
other  parishes  in  JIull  who  have  nny  poems  in  Uaelic  ol 
Fing:i!  or  his  heroes.  Tliere  are  still  a  great  many  of  them 
han>ied  down  by  tiadiiion,  but  they  are  of  that  kind  that 
Mr.  Macpherson,  I  think  judiciously,  rejects  as  Irish  imi- 
tations of  the  woiks  of  Ossian." 

t  At  least  in  Leathley  and  Wilson's  edition,  Dame- 
treet,  Dublin,  1763, 


pherson  conceived  and  executed  the  idea  of 
eliminating  all  that  displeased  his  taste  in 
the  Irish  ballads  or  tales,  rejecting  mon- 
strous fables,  making  the  marvellous  suited 
to  the  age  in  which  he  lived — the  age  that 
welcomed  the  Hcnriade  as  an  epic  poem, 
allowing  nothing  more  supernatural  than 
such  things  as  noble  ghosts  :  not  vulgar, 
hideous  apparitions  that  terrify  children, 
but  shadowy  manes  that  reveal  themselves 
in  visions  or  in  dreams  ;  even  in  the  case  of 
his  living  characters,  obliging  people  to 
speak  for  ever  in  the  style  of  those  love 
sonnets  or  elegies  in  which  he  so  much  ad- 
mired the  genius  which  the  bards  of  Ireland 
displayed  ;  removing  all  variety  from  con- 
versation as  well  as  from  his  landscape  ; 
crowding  into  the  poem  endlessly  renewed 
declarations  of  generous  and  tender  emo- 
tions after  the  most  brilliant  and  touching 
Celtic  models,  with  simple  councils  and 
courtships,  very  simple  battles,  and  still 
more  simple  drinking-feasts  ;  throwing  the 
whole  into  the  recognised  forms  of  classic 
poetry,  and  introducing  the  disguised  love- 
sick Amazon  of  mediaeval  times.  Whether 
it  be  true  that  Macpherson  formed  his 
poems  in  this  wa)',  by  elimination,*  com- 
bination, and  imitation,  or  really  found 
them  already  composed  in  a  manner  so 
suited  to  his  taste,  is  a  matter  with  which 
here  we  have  no  close  concern.  We  have 
really  only  to  do  with  literary  not  with  his- 
torical criticism,  and  what  we  are  now  to 
examine  is,  whether  Macpherson's  taste  was 
correct  or  not  with  regard  to  Irish  Ossianic 
poetry;  whether  he  was  right  in  thinking 
that  the  variety  of  life  and  character 
therein,  embracing  the  vulgar  and  the  mar- 
vellous, is  a  disorder  and  a  taint  ;  whether 


*  .\fier  ail,  thi>  view  dues  nut  dift'er  so  very  much 
fiom  that  of  the  Highhmd  Committee,  from  whose  book 
we  have  already  quoted.  They  say,  in  summing  up  their 
report  with  regard  to  Macpherson  :  "The  Committee  has 
nut  been  able  to  obtain  any  one  poem  the  same  in  title 
and  tenor  with  the  jiuems  published  by  him.  It  is 
inclined  to  believe  that  he  was  in  u^e  (sic)  to  supply 
charms,  ind  to  give  connect  on  by  inserting  passages 
which  he  ilid  not  tind,  and  tu  add  what  he  conceived  to 
be  dignity  and  ddic.icy  to  the  origin.il  composition  by 
itiiking  out  passages,  by  S'lfiening  incideius,  by  refining 
the  language — in  short,  by  changing  wliat  he  considered 
as  too  simple  or  too  rude  fur  a  modern  ear,  and  ele- 
vating what  in  his  opinion  was  below  the  standard  of 
good  poetry." 


THE   GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


the  less  varied  and  more  continuously  sen- 
timental form  of  poetry  that  commended 
itself  to  his  taste  is  really  an  improve- 
ment, we  do  not  mean  in  course  of  time, 
but  simply  in  comparison. 

We  venture  to  think  there  are  two  prin- 
ciples with  regard  to  Macpherson's  Ossianic 
poetry  that  cannot  welf  be  contested.  The 
first  is  that  much  of  the  sentimentality  in 
it  is  fine.  This  seems  sufficiently  proved 
by  the  welcome  given  to  it  in  Europe  gene- 
rally. The  second  is  that  along  with  this 
fine  sentimentality  there  is  too  much  mono- 
tony. Blair  himself,  Macpherson's  great 
defender,  admits  the  want  of  variety  of 
events  and  the  sameness  of  character  in 
Macpherson's  Ossian.  He  claims  for  it 
great  excellence  only  with  regard  to  senti-  ' 
ment.  We  are  following  most  closely  the 
criticism  of  Dr.  Blair  in  the  principles  we 
have  laid  down.  In  his  critical  Dissertation  I 
on  Ossian,  he  compares  Ossian  with  Homer,  ] 
but  sa}-s  :  "  The  Greek  has  in  several  points 
a  manifest  superiority  :  he  introduces  a 
greater  variety  of  incidents,  he  possesses  a 
larger  compass  of  ideas,  has  more  diver- 
sity in  his  characters,  and  a  much  deeper 
knowledge  of  human  nature."  Later  on 
he  declares,  on  the  other  hand,  that  "with 
regard  to  dignity  of  sentiment,  the  pre- 
eminence must  clearly  be  given  to  Ossian." 

In  the  Irish  ballads  the  sentimentality 
that  occurs  is  of  the  same  kind  as  that 
of  ^Macpherson's  Ossian.  We  have  seen 
how  Macpherson  himself  praised  the  Irish 
bards  when  they  dealt  with  sentiment  in 
odes  and  elegies.  The  sentimentality  in 
the  Ossianic  ballads  is,  as  the  reader  will 
shortly  see,  of  a  kind  that  must  be  recog- 
nised as  akin  to  what  Macpherson  brought 
forward  in  his  own  Ossian  ;  and  no  doubt 
also  to  what  he  tells  us  he  admired  in  the 
short  Irish  poems.  Now  if  what  is  brought 
in  to  diversify  this  is  contemptible,  as  Mac- 
pherson maintains,  no  doubt  it  is  merely  a 
debasement — we  do  not  mean  in  the  histo- 
rical, but  in  the  literary  sense.  If,  on  the 
contrary,  it  is  something  that  possesses 
considerable  literary  merit,  the  Irish  ballads 
are  all  the  better  for  containing  it. 

We  need  scarcel\-  say  that  we,  who  have 
defended  the  episode  of  the  hydra  against 


Dr.  Joyce,  are  going  to  defend  the  varied 
life-pictures  of  our  Ossianic  poems  against 
Macpherson.  And  now  we  rejoice  to  say 
we  shall  have  Dr.  Joyce  on  our  side,  or  to 
speak  properly — we  have  spoken  very  im- 
properly indeed,  and  we  ask  pardon — we 
shall  be  contending  under  the  standard  that 
has  been  setupbyDr.Joyce.  It  is  he,noother, 
that  has  truly  brought  forward  the  claims 
of  Irish  literature  to  possess  not  only  poetry, 
but  compositions  that  as  complete  works 
have  real  literary  merit.  This  is  the  second 
and  crowning  step  in  the  vindication  of  that 
literature.  The  first  step  was  effectually 
taken — whether  we  like  to  acknowledge  it 
or  not — by  Macpherson  himself  ;  he  with 
his  Ossian — which  even  according  to  him 
was  onl}-  the  undebased  model  of  Irish 
poems — -made  the  world  generally  admit 
that  there  were  no  doubt  snatches  of  poetry 
to  be  found  in  the  old  lays  of  Ireland. 

Farther  than  this,  up  to  the  present  day, 
people  had  not  advanced.  Lord  Macaulay 
is  a  most  curious  instance  of  the  work 
really  done  by  Macpherson's  Ossian.  He 
overflowed  with  contempt  for  Macpherson  ; 
he  loved  to  hold  him  up  to  ridicule.  But 
when,  at  the  commencement  of  his  history, 
he  undertakes  to  tell  of  Spenser's  views 
with  regard  to  Irish  poetry,  it  really  seems 
to  be  Macpherson's  objections  that  he  puts 
forward,  though  not  applied  exactly  as 
Macpherson  would  have  wished.  Spenser 
takes  great  trouble  to  explain  at  length 
the  beauty  of  an  Irish  poem.  He  then 
makes  his  stupid  Eudoxus  ask  the  clever 
IreniEUs  whether  the  Irish  "have  any  <?>-/ 
in  their  compositions,"  and  makes  Irenaeus 
answer,  "  Yea,  truly,"  at  once,  and  then  goes 
on  to  explain,  first,  that  Irish  poems 
"  savoured  of  sweet  wit  and  good  inven- 
tion ;"  secondly,  that  they  "  skilled  not  of 
the  goodly  ornaments  of  poetry ;"  and 
thirdly,  that  nevertheless  they  had  "good 
grace  and  coineHness"  for  they  W'ere  "  sprin- 
kled with  some  pretty  flowers  of  their 
natural  device,  which  gave  good  grace  and 
comeliness  to  them."  The  goodly  orna- 
ments of  poetry,  as  contradistinguished 
from  natural  device,  means,  doubtless,  the 
artificial  style  of  the  Spenserian  age  in 
England.     We  cannot   seriously  maintain 


THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


that  Spenser  found  the  poems  wild  and 
rugged  which,  without  those  "goodly  orna- 
ments," had  yet  good  grace  and  comeliness, 
and  which  savoured  of  sweet  wit  and  good 
invention.  Yet  Lord  Macaulay  simply 
tells  us  that  the  Irish  ballads,  "  wild  and 
rugged  as  they  were,  seemed  to  the  judg- 
ing eye  of  Spenser  to  contain  a  portion  of 
the  pure  gold  of  poetry."  This  scarcely 
gives  an  idea  of  how  Spenser  judged. 

Macaulay  had  drunk  in  without  knowing 
it  the  debasement  theory  of  the  Scotch- 
man he  despised,  so  far  as  it  related  to  the 
value  of  any  Irish  poems,  and  he  could  not 
see  that  Spenser  did  not  hold  it.  Macaulay 
could  not  believe  his  own  eyes  that  an 
ancient  witness,  like  Spenser,  had  nothing 
about  the  corruptions  and  the  dross,  mixed 
with  portions  of  pure  gold,  in  the  works  of 
Irish  bards.  He  was  thoroughly,  though 
unconsciously,  imbued  with  the  Macpher- 
son  theorj'  of  Irish  airiosa  fdicitas. 

Mr.  Matthew  Arnold,  too,  in  his  studies 
of  Celtic  literature,  seems  after  all  to  find 
not  much  more  than  this  curiosa  felicitas. 
M.  Rénan,  indeed,  appears  more  favour- 
able. He  tells  us  that  Irish  imagination 
has  grouped  round  the  legend  of  a  monk  a 
whole  cjxle  of  ph\-sical  and  maritime 
myths,  and  that  the  poem  of  the  Voyage 
of  St.  Brendan  is  one  of  the  most  astonish- 
ing creations  of  the  human  mind.  But 
who  really  attends  to  M.  Renan's  views  on 
Celtic? 

We  shall  find  what  people  generally 
think,  in  a  plain  but  carefully-written  paper 
on  "The  Celt  of  Wales  and  the  Celt  of  Ire- 
land," that  appeared  four  or  five  years  ago 
in  the  Corniiill  Magazine.  The  author  has 
had  good  experience  of  both  countries,  and 
evidently  studied  the  inhabitants  from 
many  points  of  view.  He  appears  quite 
free  from  every  kind  of  prejudice  against 
them.  He  bears  freely  testimony  to  the 
good  qualities  of  Irishmen.  In  regard  of 
pure  morality,  he  tells  us  "  the  peasantry 
of  Ireland  are  at  the  verj'  summit  of  the 
scale  of  the  whole  world."  He  tells  us 
that  one  can  perceive  "the  different  face 
of  Celtic  minds "  from  that  of  Anglo- 
Teutons,  "  by  a  comparison  of  the  really 
delifrhtful  intelligence  of  a  school  of  Irish 


children,  with  the  heaviness  and  slowness 
of  a  similar  and  much  better  fed  and 
clothed  class,  in  any  part  of  England,  even 
in  the  great  towns."     He  adds  : — 

I  have  often  tested  the  ability  of  young  Irish  boys  and 
girls,  either  to  understand  a  piece  of  humour  or  to  appre- 
ciate an  act  of  heroism,  or,  generally,  to  take  in  any 
idea  quite  new  to  them  ;  and  never  yet  failed  of  success. 
But  the  very  same  joke  or  story  or  new  idea  presented 
to  very  "sharp"  English  town  boys,  has  been  utterly 
misunderstood. 

But  when  this  clearly  painstaking  and 
unprejudiced  observer  comes  to  speak  of 
Celtic  Literature,  we  find  ourselves  simply 
face  to  face  once  more  with  the  curiosa 
felicitas  of  ]\Iacpherson. 

Immediately  after  the  paragraph  quoted 
above,  we  read  the  following : — 

Imagination  is  a  quality  which  I  suppose  will  on  all 
hands  be  conceded  pre-eminently  to  the  Celtic  race  ; 
and  yet  perhaps  it  would  be  more  proper  to  credit  it 
with  the  potlictit  tftiiperamiut,  than  with  tlie  actual  power 

of  imagination  in  its  higher  w.^lks One 

point  at  all  events  i-i  patent,  that  the  merits  of  Erse  and 
Cymric  poetry  is  (sic)  not  of  that  solid  kind  which  can 
bear  translation. 

A  little  farther  on  the  writer  gives  us 
his  ideas  as  to  what  our  Irish  imaginative 
productions  are.     He  writes: — 

Irish  imagination,  though  it  has  called  up  the  banshee 
and  an  abundance  of  hereditary  curses,  revels  chiefly  in 
more  r/'íTH/í  dre.ims — the  Lcprachaun  and  Phuca  (Puck)  ; 
the  beautiful  invisible  island  of  St.  Urandan  in  the  far 
Atlantic  ;  the  towers  of  the  submerged  city  beneath  Louÿh 
Xeagh  ;  and  the  endless  droll  legends  of  the  giant  Fin 
.McCoul. 

This  utterly  "  crass  "  ignorance  as  to  what 
Irish  literature  is,  this  supposing  the  nume- 
rous myths  about  Fionn  to  be  "  endless 
droll  legends,"  this  it  is  which  allows  Mac- 
pherson's  theor>-  of  curiosa  felicitas  to  con- 
tinue prevalent.  The  great  blow  against  it 
has  been  struck  by  Dr.  Joyce.  He  has 
ventured  to  translate  for  the  ordinar\-  cul- 
tivated reader  a  considerable  portion  of 
that  Erse  poetrj'  which  it  is  said  cannot 
bear  translation  ;  and  he  has  translated  in 
such  a  manner  as  to  show  that  what  he 
least  cares  for  is  any  curiosa  felicitas  that 
may  happen  to  occur.*  He  has  taken  prose 
tales  and  tales  in  verse   together,  without

distinction,  and  presented  them  to  the 
EngUsh  reader  as  fully  worthy  of  liis  at- 
tention, precisely  for  their  merits  as  com- 
plete and  integral  compositions,  as  old 
Celtic  romances,  really  poetic  stories  told 
in  the  old  Irish  way.

THE   TEACHING   OF   IRISH. 


Any  person  interested  in  the  study  of  lan- 
guages and  their  literature,  who,  emanci- 
pating himself  from  common  prejudices, 
makes  a  serious  effort  to  cultivate  a  know- 
ledge of  the  primitive  and  beautiful  Celtic 
family  of  tongues,  will  have  his  attention  at 
once  caught  by  the  best  preserved  of  these, 
viz.,  the  modern  Irish.  He  will,  in  the  inte- 
rests of  science  and  literature,  regret  the 
rapid  disappearance  of  this  venerable  lan- 
guage, as  well  as  the  unfortunate  apathy  of 
those  who  at  present  are  able  to  use  it  in 
adopting  means  towards  its  preservation. 
He  will  consider  them  as  unreflecting  per- 
sons in  possession  of  a  precious  treasure 
who  cast  it  from  them  through  ignorance 
its  value  ;  for  when  once  the  use  of  a  lan- 
guage is  lost  by  a  people,  they  never  tho- 
roughly regain  it.  To  such  a  man,  espe- 
cially if  he  be  an  Irishman,  the  necessity 
for  fostering  the  Irish  language  before  it  be 
too  late  will  often  form  a  subject  of  reflec- 
tion, and  the  mention  of  its  revival  will 
always  cause  the  liveliest  interest.  Every 
such  person,  therefore,  must  feel  attracted 
by  the  discussion  of  opinions  on  the  best 
manner  of  attaining  a  knowledge  of  and 
teaching  the  Irish  language. 

In  order  to  clear  the  way  for  such  a  dis- 
cussion, it  seems  in  the  first  place  needful 
to  pass  in  review  the  principal,  real  or  ap- 
parent, obstacles  to  the  learning  of  the 
ancient  tongue  of  the  most  western  isle  of 
Europe.     These  obstacles — most  of  which, 


THE   GAELIC   JOURNAL.

by-the-way,  are  more  apparent  than  real — 
may  be  classed,  nearly  all,  under  two  heads, 
viz. :    1st,  those  which   originate    in   igno- 
rance ;    and   2nd,  those   comprised  in    the 
modern    term,    "  philistinism."     The    great 
mass  of  ordinary  people  are  quite  ignorant 
of  the  general  nature  and  peculiar  charac- 
teristics  and    differences  of  different    lan- 
guages,  and    as    they   judge  of    all    other 
forms  of  speech  by  that  which  they  habitu- 
ally use,  and  in  which  they  think,  they  are 
unwilling,  unless  persuaded  by  the  public 
opinion  around  them,  to  allow  of  the  exist- 
ence   of  beauty   or    merit   in    any  tongue 
differing  much  from  their  own  in  sound  or 
construction.       To     such     narrow-minded  I 
speakers  of  English  alone,  who  have  not 
been  taught  otherwise,   Irish,  if  they  ever 
hear  it  spoken,   is  an  object  of  dislike  or 
even    of  contempt.      They    are    prone    to 
despise  or  hate  whatever  they  cannot  under- 
stand.    Of  this  description  are  many  Irish- 
men who  not  only  do  not  know  anything 
of  their  country's  language,  but  are  equally 
ignorant  of  her  history  and  antiquities,  and 
of  the  very  existence  of  an  Irish  literature. 
Of  course  they  know  nothing  of  the  value 
of  the   language   and    literature  to   philo- 
logical science,  or  of  the  beautiful  construc- 
tion of  the  former  and  its  use  equally  with 
Greek,  German,  or   Sanscrit,  as  a  training 
for  the  mind.     In  the  same  way,  men  who 
are    classical    scholars    and    nothing    else, 
generally  have  a  dislike  for  mathematics, 
while  mathematical  specialists  usually  de- 
test the  study  of  classics.     Thus  there  are 
thousands  who  know  of  the  existence  of 
the  Hiberno-Celtic   only  to  dislike  or  de- 
preciate it.  On  this  class  of  persons,  whether 
Irish  or  not,  argument   on  the  subject    is 
thrown  away.    Disregarding  the  axiom  that 
we   must  know  something  about  a  subject 
before  we  can  pass  judgment  on  it,  their 
ignorance  gives  them  a  force  of  inertia  proof 
against  the  appeals  of  science,   patriotism, 
and  intellect,  and  their  crass  prepossessions 
are  impenetrable  to  the  force  of  argument 
or  the  light  of  progressing  intelligence.     So 
we  must  needs  leave  them  in  their  dark- 
ness, it  being  impossible  to  teach  those  who 
will  not  learn. 

The  second  great  obstacle  to  the  learn- 


ing of  Irish  is  "  philistinism."  By  philis- 
tinism is  generally  understood  that  devotion 
to  material  gain  and  sensual  enjoyments 
which  makes  money-grubbing  the  sole  ob- 
ject of  life,  without  regard  to  moral,  intel- 
lectual, or  artistic  considerations.  This 
money-grubbing,  and  the  love  of  sensual 
pleasures — in  short,  that  gross  form  of  mate- 
rialism so  characteristic  of  the  nineteenth 
century — these  low  and  base  motives,  con- 
stitute the  principal  obstacles  to  the  study 
of  the  Irish  language.  One  hears  conti- 
nually in  reference  to  this  study:  "Will  it 
pay?"  or  "what  shall  I  gain  by  learning 
it?" — just  as  if  the  goodness  and  value  of 
everything  were  to  be  measured  by  the 
amount  of  money  to  be  acquired  by  it. 
Religion,  art,  science,  literature,  patriotism, 
poetry,  virtue — everything  that  is  ennobling 
to  human  nature,  would  possess  but  little  in- 
fluence or  charm  if  judged  by  this  sordid 
standard.  The  man  who  essays  to  teach 
Irish  must  set  his  face  firmly  against  this 
degrading  philistinism,  and  must  impress 
upon  his  pupils  the  necessity  of  taking  into 
account  the  beauties  of  the  language,  and 
the  advantages  to  the  mind  of  the  novel 
and  fresh  modes  of  thought  developed  in  its 
construction  and  expressions.  He  must 
show  how — 

Bright-eyed  Fancy  hovering  o'er, 

Scatters  from  her  pictured  urn 

Thoughts  that  breathe  and  words  tliat  burn. 

But  even  those  who  are  not  absolute  and 
thorough  "  philistines "  are  frequently  re- 
pelled from  the  study  of  Irish  by  difficul- 
ties which  are  really  only  apparent,  such  as 
the  difference  of  printed  cliaracters,  the,  at 
first  sight,  complex  grammar,  the  unfamiliar 
articulations,  and  the  scarcity  of  good  ele- 
mentary books  and  of  skilled  teachers. 
These  difficulties  we  shall  show  to  be  very 
slight  indeed,  and  easily  overcome,  when 
resolutely  faced.  But  before  proceeding  to 
prove  our  point,  we  need  merely  allude  to 
the  numerous  classof  persons  in  this  country 
who,  animated  by  an  irrational  and  un- 
patriotic spirit,  would  wish  for  nothing 
better  than  that  the  Irish  language  should 
be  dead  and  forgotten,  as  is  the  Sumerian 
or  Etruscan,  and  all  Irish  books  and  manu- 
scripts sunk  in  the  sea  or  consumed  by  fire.

THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


Some  Vandals  there  may  be  even  \-et  who 
cherish  the  same  unworthy  feehngs  towards 
the  Irish  race  as  towards  their  language 
and  literature.  With  such  as  these  we  have 
nothing  to  do. 

"  Non  ragionar  di  lor,  na  guarda  c  passa." 
Let  us  now  see  what  the  other  difiicul- 
ties  alluded  to  are  worth.  With  respect 
to  the  Irish  characters,  they  are  only  a  form 
of  the  early  medireval  Roman  letters,  and 
can  be  learned  in  half-an-hour.  Any  person 
who  cannot  make  use  of  them  will  certainly 
be  unable  to  learn  the  language  itself.  The 
grammar  is  not  so  complex  as  that  of  the 
Latin  or  Greek  among  ancient,  or  of 
German  or  Hindoostanee  among  modern 
languages,  and  when  once  the  rules  of  Aspi- 
ration and  Eclipsis  are  mastered,  it  is  com- 
paratively easy.  The  sounds  are  of  course 
different  from  those  of  the  English  lan- 
guage, but  so  are  those  of  e\ery  other 
tongue.  Whatever  articulate  sounds  the 
ear  is  accustomed  to  it  will  hear  with  plea- 
sure, and  unaccustomed  ones  will  at  first 
seem  disagreeable.  Thus  the  English  "  th  " 
in  "  lengtli  "  is  an  abomination  to  most  of  the 
peoples  of  the  Continent  who  do  not  possess 
it  in  their  own  tongues,  the  //  so  much 
admired  by  the  Welsh  is  unpleasant  to  the 
other  inhabitants  of  Great  Britain,  and  so  on. 
Accordingly,  the  Irish  aspirated  c  and  g, 
the  ng  at  the  beginning  of  a  word,  the 
broad  //  and  ;/,  the  slender  ;-  and  some 
other  sounds  must  at  first  appear  strange  to 
the  unaccustomed  ear.  To  a  person  habi- 
tuated to  speak  nothing  but  Irish,  the 
English  consonants  sound  harsh  and  un- 
euphonious,  and  in  our  opinion  with  much 
greater  reason.  We  consider  the  Irish  lan- 
guage, when  properly  spoken,  as  particu- 
larly sweet  and  euphonious,  and  much 
better  suited  for  singing  than  any  of  those 
of  the  northern  part  of  Europe,  and  we 
speak  from  considerable  experience.  These 
things  should  all  be  explained  by  the 
teacher  to  his  pupil,  and  the  ear  of  the 
latter  should  be  accustomed,  by  frequent 
repetition,  to  the  more  peculiar  sounds  of 
the  language.  As  'OiibAlrAc  11K\c  Pubipj 
would  say,  thus  should  the  ■|.-oi)\ceAX)l..\i-óe 
act  towards  the  yójLAnin-ó. 

The   little   use  made  of  Irish   in    com- 


merce and  trade,  it  being  colloquially 
almost  entirely  restricted  to  the  peasantry 
in  the  west  and  south,  the  small  number  of 
modern  books  printed  in  the  language — 
these  do  not  constitute  reasons  why  it 
should  not  be  revived  and  still  flourish,  if 
proper  means  are  taken  for  the  purpose,  nor 
do  they  take  a'i\ay  from  its  beauty  and 
scientific  value.  The  same  objections  might 
have  been  made  half  a  century  ago  to 
various  other  European  languages  which 
are  now  flourishing.  These  arc,  therefore, 
obstacles  to  the  learning  of  Irish  which 
both  teacher  and  pupil  can  afford  to  disre- 
gard. Slight  obstacles,  such  as  those  we 
have  mentioned,  have  been  conquered  in 
Wales,  Belgium,  Bohemia,  Iceland,  &c.,  and 
why  not  in  our  island  ?  and  of  this  wc  may 
be  certain,  that  a  language  is  a  most  dis- 
tinctive mark  of  the  intellectual  indepen- 
dence of  any  nation,  and  the  best  guarantee 
of  its  continuance. 

The  teaching  of  Irish  must  be  modified 
in  its  methods  to  suit  two  classes  of  learn- 
ers— those  who  speak  the  language  from 
their  childhood,  and  those  who  have  little 
or  no  knowledge  of  the  spoken  tongue. 
Of  the  former  class  it  may  be  affirmed  that 
they  have  been  worse  than  neglected  in  an 
educational  sense,  and  that  every  effort  has 
been  made  to  deprive  them  of  the  inesti- 
mable treasure  of  their  native  tongue.  If 
the  "  National "  system  of  education  had 
been  really  national  from  its  inception, 
Irish-speaking  children  would  be  taught 
first  to  read  Irish  as  a  preparation  for  learn- 
ing English  :  and  this  it  is  not  yet  too  late 
to  put  into  practice.  By  this  rational  plan, 
instead  of  time  being  lost,  much  time  would 
be  gained,  and  the  teaching  would  be  com- 
prehensible to  the  children,  and  approach 
towards  completeness.  For  such  children 
primers  and  spelling-books  wholly  in  Irish 
should  be  prepared  ;  and  there  is  no  reason 
why  elementaiy  geography  and  arithmetic 
should  not  be  likewise  taught  in  the  verna- 
cular tongue  of  the  pupils.  Such  a  course 
would  not  prevent  these  children  learning 
English  as  well,  and  in  a  much  more  in- 
telligent, satisfactorj',  and  consequently 
quicker  manner  than  is  done  at  present — 
for  instance,   in   the   Arran    Islands  or  in

Erris.  We  speak  from  the  experience  of 
similar  districts  to  these,  and  we  need  only 
refer  in  confirmation  of  the  above  state- 
ments to  the  recorded  opinion  of  Sir  P.  J. 
Keenan. 

For  those  who  study  Irish  as  a  non- 
vernacular  (we  would  not  say  a  foreign) 
language,  the  methods  would  suit  which  are 
now  employed  in  teaching  other  modern 
languages.  In  adapting  these  to  Irish,  we 
must  first  obtain  good  elementary  works. 
The  three  books  published  under  the  name 
of  the  Society  for  the  Preservation  of  the 
Irish  Language  are  excellent,  as  far  as  they 
go,  but  they  do  not  go  far  enough.  A 
fourth,  fifth,  sixth,  and  succeeding  books 
are  required  on  the  same  plan,  taking 
pupils  through  the  declensions  and  conju- 
gations and  the  other  portions  of  the  gram- 
mar and  idioms,  as  also  books  supplemen- 
tary to  the  first  three,  containing  more 
extended  exercises  on  the  contents  of  these 
latter.  A  modification  of  the  methods  of 
Ahn,  Ollendorff,  and  Arnold  combined 
would,  we  think,  be  the  most  suitable  for 
these  works.  They  should  contain  no  un- 
necessar)',  diffuse,  or  scientific  disquisi- 
tions ;  no  visionar}^  theories  or  philological 
hypotheses ;  no  doubtful  etj'mologies  or 
strained  explanations  ;  but  should  be  clear, 
concise,  and,  above  all,  correct  and  idiomatic 
in  orthography  and  phraseology.  Such 
works  should  be  carefully  written  and  re- 
vised, and  not  issued  till  well  examined  and 
corrected  by  persons  possessing  a  practical 
knowledge  of  the  spoken  language  and  of 
its  grammatical  construction.  Another 
series  of  elementaiy  treatises,  with  fuller 
notes  and  explanations,  should  be  pre- 
pared for  those  who  aim  at  self-instruction 
in  the  language. 

A  person  who  does  not  possess  a  good 
knowledge  of  a  subject  cannot  teach  it 
efficiently.  On  the  other  hand,  there  is 
many  a  man  knowing  a  subject  thoroughly, 
and  yet  unable  to  communicate  his  know- 
ledge easily  and  clearly  to  a  pupil.  Know- 
ledge and  the  power  of  communicating  it 
are  two  entirely  distinct  things,  and  the 
present  state  of  Irish  teaching  is  a  very 
good  example  of  the  truth  of  this  principle. 
Of  the  many  thousands   who  speak   Irish 


fluently  and  correctly,  how  few  there  are 
able  to  communicate  their  knowledge  of 
the  language  to  others,  or  even  capable  of 
rationally  explaining  the  construction  and 
meaning  of  a  simple  idiomatic  phrase  in 
their  native  tongue.  Even  most  of  those 
who  can  read  and  write  as  well  as  speak 
Irish,  seem  to  be  almost  as  helpless  in  this 
respect  as  the  mass  of  illiterate  persons. 
The  remedies  for  this  defect  must  be — ist, 
a  careful  study  of  the  rules  of  Irish  gram- 
mar and  orthography  ;  and  2nd,  the  ac- 
quiring of  an  acquaintance  with  school  me- 
thods, particularly  those  used  in  the  teach- 
ing of  other  modern  languages.  Our  aim 
at  present  must  therefore  be  two-fold — to 
produce  good  elementary  books  and  trained 
teachers  of  the  language.  Anyone  who  can 
speak  Irish,  read  English,  and  knows  some- 
thing of  general  grammar  and  of  another 
modern  language,  will  require  very  little 
effort  to  become  an  efficient  teacher  of  Irish, 
if  possessed  of  the  ordinary  mental  qualifi- 
cations necessary  for  every  person  who 
aims  at  teaching  any  subject  whatever. 
Such  a  man  can  train  himself  by  acting  on 
the  lines  indicated  above.

And  now  it  shall  notdie ;  through  all  the  ages

TO  THE  READERS 

OF 

E  ij  c    Gaelic    3  0 II  r  n  a  I . 

The  heavy  burden  of  establishing  and  con- 
ducting  a  periodical  exclusively  devoted  to 
the  interests  of  the  Irish  Language  has 
rightly  fallen  to  the  Council  of  the  Gaelic 
Union. 

Their  wisdom  and  patriotism  have  been 
proved  by  their  work,  and  by  no  portion  of 
their  work  more  than  by  the  lines  which 
they  have  laid  down  for  the  conduct  of  this 
periodical.  Their  provisional  circular,  widely 
distributed,  and  which  has  met  with  all  but 
universal  approbation,  indicates  clearly  the 
course  of  action. 

It  is  well  known  that  they  have  for  some 
years  conducted  in  several  important  weekly 
journals  "  Gaelic  Departments,"  which  have 
prepared  the  way  for  their  Gaelic  Journal, 
and  have,  in  fact,  rendered  the  establish- 
ment of  such  a  journal  a  matter  of  necessity. 

Since  they  first  commenced  their  work, 
now  more  than  si.x  years  ago,  the  feeling 
in  favour  of  the  preservation  of  our  ancient 
language  in  those  districts, where  it  still 
keeps  its  grouiid  has  been  steadily  increas- 
ing. The  progress  towards  the  end  in  view 
may  have  been  slow,  but  it  has  been  sure  ; 
and  now,  at  length,  what  there  can  be  no 
hesitation  in  considering  the  most  impor- 
tant step  yet  decided  on,  and  likely  to  be  the 
most  useful  and  most  productive  of  good 
results,  is  about  to  be  taken. 

The  Council  having  unanimously  decided 
on  appointing  me  Editor  of  their  journal, 
it  is  necessary  that  I  should  say  a  few  words 
as  to  the  hope  I  have  of  being  able  to  do 
some  service  in  that  position. 

I  have  too  high  a  sense  of  the  honour 
they  have  thus  done  me,  and  too  keen  an 
appreciation  of  the  spirit  which  prompted 
the  proposal,  to  attempt  to  decline  it,  or  to 
hesitate  about  undertaking  a  work  of  labour 
and  responsibility. 

Were  it  not  that  I  know  very  well  on 
whom  I  can  depend  for  willing  help  in  this 
work,  I  should  be  the  very  reverse  of  con- 
fident.    The  early  numbers  will  show  that 


those  who  have  all  along  provided  the 
varied  literary  contributions  in  prose  and 
poetry  for  the  "Gaelic  Departments"  of 
which  I  had  charge,  are  still  working  in 
such  a  way  as  will  probably,  in  a  very  short 
time,  render  my  office,  as  before,  almost  a 
sinecure.  The  difficulty  I  have  hitherto 
experienced  was,  not  the  want  of  readable 
original  matter,  but  the  want  of  space  in 
the  scanty  column  or  so  allowed  me  in 
newspapers,  and  which  very  often  caused 
great  disappointment  to  able  contributors 
who  were  only  anxious  to  work  for  the 
production  of  a  modern  Gaelic  literature, 
if  permitted. 

It  will  be  strange,  indeed,  if  this  journal, 
founded  as  it  is  on  an  independent  basis, 
going  neither  to  the  right  nor  to  the  left, 
but  keeping  its  object  steadily  in  view,should 
be  allowed  to  languish  and  die.  Estab- 
lished, not  as  a  commercial,  but  as  a  purely 
patriotic  undertaking,  and  by  those  who 
have  already  given  such  good  earnest  of 
their  zeal  and  energy,  I  cannot  believe  that 
Irishmen  will  fail  in  their  clear  duty  of 
sustaining  the  Gaelic  Union,  which  in  this 
effort  needs  the  aid  of  all. 

Many  things  are  yet  necessary  to  com- 
plete_our  country's  regeneration  and  secure 
her  happiness,  but  I  am  unwilling  to  believe 
that  in  the  struggle  she  would  suffer  her 
language  to  be  lost ;  and  I  think  that  if  the 
ca.se  were  fairly  put  before  the  people,  they 
would  not  purchase  a  (perhaps)  very  tem- 
porary material  advantage  by  the  loss  of 
the  one  grand  link  which  binds  them  to  the 
past — the  one  indelible,  undying  and  un- 
mistakable mark  of  Irishmen.

On  the  7th  November,  1881,  the  great 
defender  and  supporter  of  the  Irish  language 
departed  this  life.  It  is  now  exactly  a  year 
since  the  elegy  we  print  in  this  number  was 
written  by  the  youthful  Gaelic  poet,  so  well 
known  under  the  ìwìii-dc-pliune  of  "An 
Chraoibhin  Aoibliinn'.'  We  content  our- 
selves on  the  anniversary  of  the  sad  event 


THE    GAELIC    JOURNAL. 


which  called  forth  this  touching  and  beauti- 
ful tribute  by  simply  placing  the  poem 
before  our  readers.  It  requires  no  words  of 
ours  to  keep  the  great  prelate's  memory 
green.  This  poem  is,  so  far  as  we  know, 
the  only  wreath  of  song  which  has  been 
offered  to  the  memorj'  of  the  poet  who  gave 
us  Homer's  heroic  page  and  RIoore's  sweet 
lyric  in  our  countrj-'s  language  for  the  first 
time. 

Our  readers  are,  doubtless,  aware  that  a 
Memoir  of  the  "  Life  and  Times  of  John 
MacHale"has  been  recently  published  by 
Rev.  Canon  Bourke.  We  intend  noticing 
this  work  in  a  future  number,  and  shall  here 
advert  to  it  merely  for  the  purpose  of  intro- 
ducing an  account  of  the  Archbishop's  Life 
b)'  the  same  author  in  the  Irish  language, 
and  which  will  be  continued  in  this  journal 
until  concluded.  This  is  a  different  work 
— in  its  plan,  st)-le  and  scope — from  the 
English  "  Life,"  and  (at  least  in  the  early 
part)  may  be  looked  on  as  the  original  of 
the  English.  It  was  undertaken  in  conse- 
quence of  a  suggestion  made  to  us  by 
Mr.  Thomas  Planner}-,  of  London  (himself 
a  clever  writer  of  Irish  prose  and  poetry, 
and  a  contributor  to  this  journal;,  that  we 
should  ask  Canon  Bourke  to  write  Arch- 
bishop MacHale's  Life  in  Irish  as  the  most 
fitting  tribute  that  could  be  offered  to  his 
illustrious  friend's  memory.  Canon  Bourke 
willingly  complied,  and  more  than  nine 
chapters  were  written  before  he  even  enter- 
tained the  idea  of  writing  the  English  work, 
which,  as  he  says  in  his  preface,  he  was 
pressed  to  begin  by  literarj-  friends.  Though 
not  so  comprehensive  in  its  scope,  the  Irish 
"  Life,"  we  venture  to  think,  will  be  found 
quite  as  interesting  as  the  English  work. 
The  style  is  clear,  easy  and  natural,  and  our 
Irish  classes  and  students  will  find  it  a  most 
desirable  reading  book. 


Dramatic  Scenes. 

It  has  been  reser\-ed  for  our  day  to  wit- 
ness, and  for  our  journal  to  contain,  the 
commencement  of  a  series  of  Dramatic 
Scenes,  the  first  ever  written  in  the  Irish 
language,  and  which  develop  a  new  vein  of 


literature,  hitherto  almost  unknown  among 
Gaelic  writers.  It  is  true,  beginnings  have 
been  already  made  by  some  good  transla- 
tions of  portions  of  English  drama  ;  but  as 
an  original  Irish  composition,  so  far  as  we 
know,  nothing  similar  to  the  piece  which  we 
with  great  pleasure  place  before  our  readers 
in  this  number,  has  hitherto  been  at- 
tempted. It  is  also  true  that  in  man)-  of 
our  ancient  poems  the  chief  characters  speak 
for  themselves,  often  with  an  interlocutor 
(not  unlike  the  Greek  chorus)  ;  but  in  these 
there  is  no  attempt  at  dramatic  design, 
colouring  or  plot.  Nevertheless,  we  are  in- 
formed that  in  Scotland  some  of  these 
ancient  dialogues  were  regularly  recited, 
and  the  characters  sustained  with  some 
regard  to  dramatic  effect.  But  dramas, 
after  all,  they  are  not,  and  do  not  pretend 
to  be  ;  yet,  considering  the  stirring  scenes, 
well-conceived  characters  and  striking  inci- 
dents which  are  now  and  then  to  be  found 
in  our  ancient  writers,  it  cannot  be  said  (as 
has  been  rashly  asserted)  that  they  had  no 
dramatic  talent  or  appreciation  of  theatri- 
cal effect,  though  it  does  not  appear  they 
ever  followed  out  this  particular  line  of  art 
as  the}-  did  so  many  others,  or  in  the  style 
which  has  produced  so  many  glorious  scenes 
in  other  tongues. 

To  our  Irish  readers  no  words  of  ours  are 
necessary  to  introduce  the  "  Soliloquy  of 
Brian  Boroimhe  before  his  last  Battle,"  but 
by  such  of  our  friends  as  have  the  mis- 
fortune to  be  still  without  sufficient  know- 
ledge of  Gaelic  to  enable  them  to  appreciate 
the  rev.  author's  composition  in  the  origi- 
nal, these  remarks  may  not  be  considered 
entirely  out  of  place.  In  further  pity  for 
their  ignorance,  and  in  order  to  encourage 
them  to  study,  the  author  has  yielded  to  a 
suggestion  made  to  him  since  the  Irish 
manuscript  passed  into  our  hands,  and  now 
appends  a  worthy  English  translation  of 
his  own  work.  We  venture  to  hope  he  will 
continue  this  practice  until  such  time  as 
it  becomes  no  longer  necessary,  when  all 
our  readers  will  be  able  not  only  to  read 
and  write  Irish,  but  to  converse  fluently 
in  the  language  with  their  Irish-speaking 
fellow-countrymen — a  consummation  de- 
voutly to  be  wished. 


THE   GAELIC   JOURNAL.

Oiir  Scotdi  and   Welsh  Friends. 

The  name  of  lAiN  Ban  OG  is  well  known 
among  Gaelic  readers  as  that  of  one  of 
the  most  correct  writers  of  Scottish  Gaelic 
in  modern  times.  We  gladly  insert  his 
hearty  Highland  "Welcome"  to  our  effort, 
and  hope,  as  he  promises,  that  we  may  fre- 
quently hear  from  him.  No  Irish  scholar 
will  have  any  difficulty  in  reading  his 
Gaelic,  which  is  very  little  removed  from 
that  of  our  best  standard  authors,  and  is  re- 
markably free  from  the  artificial  variations 
of  which  too  many  recent  Highland  writers 
are  so  fond.  We  have  also  to  express  our 
thanks  for  his  efforts  on  behalf  of  our  under- 
taking. 

Mr.  William  Spurrell,  J.P.,  of  Caer- 
marthen,  South  Wales,  is  distinguished  as  a 
Cymric  scholar,  an  enthusiast  for  the  pre- 
servation of  the  Welsh  language,  and  author 
of  several  valuable  works  on  that  ancient 
tongue,  including  a  very  useful  grammar 
and  two  dictionaries.  He  also  edits  "  Yr 
Haul"  ("The  Sun"),  a  popular  monthly 
Welsh  magazine,  and  has  ahva\-s  taken  a 
lively  interest  in  the  doings  of  those  who 
labour  for  the  preservation  of  the  Irish  lan- 
guage. The  Gaelic  Union  has  to  acknow- 
ledge several  practical  letters  and  much 
sound  advice,  which,  coming  from  so  ex- 
perienced a  source,  shall  always  command 
their  respect,  even  on  points  where  both 
parties  still  "  agree  to  differ."  In  another 
portion  of  this  journal  we  copy  a  notice 
written  by  Mr.  Spurrell  in  his  magazine 
in  reference  to  our  movement.  He  writes 
as  follows  in  explanation  of  his  Welsh 
article : — - 

I  semi  you  a  copy  of  the  Haul  (Sun),  with  a  notice 
of  the  Gaelic  Union  Report.  As  you  possibly  may  not 
understanil  the  Welsh,  1  give  you  a  free  translation  of 
^^'hat  is  said  ; — "  Some  of  our  readers  who  may  till  now 
be  unacquainted  with  the  fact  will  be  glad  to  know  that 
there  is  in  operation  in  Ireland  a  society  for  cultivating  a 
knowledge  of  the  Irish  language,  and  for  publishing 
books  for  that  purpose.  As  has  been  the  case  with  the 
Wel>h  language,  Irish  has  been  a  mark  for  the  ridicule 
of  ignorant  English  folk,  and,  we  fear,  of  ignorant  Wcl-h 
folk  too.  It  is  not  a  difficult  thing  to  despise  what  the 
despiser  does  not  understand.  But  learned  lingui^ts, 
especially  on  the  Continent,  highly  prize  both  languages, 
as  well  as  their  sister  dialects,  and  acquire  from  them  in- 
formation not  easily  obtainable  withuut  tlieir  help.  There 
are  aUo  many  very  valuable  manuscripts  in  the  language 


of  the  sister  isle  ;  but  the  language  is  under  one  disad- 
vantage  that  the  Welsh  is  free  I'roni,  that  is,  its  very 
awkward  orthography  and  inconvenient  letters.  The 
Irish  liltrali  adhere  to  the  old  form  of  letters  and  spelling 
with  determination,  forgetting  that  the  written  language 
is  not  alw.iys  the  spoken  language,  and  that  the  best 
orthography  is  that  which  shows  in  the  clearest  manner 
what  is  the  speech  of  the  people  at  each  epoch.  A  fixed 
unchangeable  orthography  hides  the  history  of  the  lan- 
guage ;  while  the  method  of  putting  in  writing  what  is 
spoken  by  the  people  should  vary  to  answer  their  speech, 
and  so  become  a  record  of  the  changes  that  are  taking 
ptice  in  it  from  age  to  age:  that  constitutes  an  historical 
orthography.  As  for  etymological  or  derivative  ortho- 
graphy, it  is  not  easy  to  settle  its  principles.  If  the 
form  of  the  language  froin  which  a  word  is  taken  is  to  be 
rctamed.  many  cognate  words,  differing  much  from  each 
other,  should  be  written  in  the  same  form  as  in  the  language 
from  which  they  are  taken,  as  esgoh,  bishop,  hieque,  &c. 
which  thus  ought  to  be  written  as  in  Latin,  if  not  as  in 
Greek.  '1  he  tiuth  is,  it  is  the  business  of  linguists  to 
trace  the  derivation  of  w-ords,  and  the  business  of  ordinary 
writers  to  show  to  the  eye  as  clearly  as  possible  what  the 
language  on  the  speaker's  tongue  is.  A  great  error  of 
the  day  is  looking  on  spelling,  especially  English  spelling, 
as  a  holy  thing  of"  the  holiest."  Mr.  Spurrell  continues  : 
"  We  here  have  no  schools  for  teaching  Welsh  except 
Sunday  schools,  and  there  persons  learn  in  the  hour  or 
two  of  the  Sunday  to  read  \Velsh  more  easily  than  they 
learn  to  read  English  in  six  or  seven  hours  of  each  of  the 
six  working  days.  The  reason  is  that  Welsh  is  nearly 
phonetic,  each  letter  having,  with  very  few  exceptions, 
only  its  own  proper  sound." 


Our  journal's  new  year  begins  on  the  1st 
November,  the  "  great  Feast  of  Sanihain 
among  the  ancient  Irish,"  and  the  morrow  of 
the  momentous  "  Oidliclic  Sam/ina,"  which, 
through  so  many  ages,  even  to  this  day, 
has  continued  in  Ireland  and  Scotland  to  be 
devoted  to  those  curious  and  primitive  cere- 
monies which,  as  shown  elsewhere  in  this 
number,  present  in  the  two  countries  such 
remarkable  evidence  of  a  common  origin. 
With  Ld  Bcallainc  (May-daj-)  Oidliche 
Saiiihna  marked  the  great  divisions  of  the 
year  in  the  primitive  calendars  of  our 
ancestors.  Each  of  these  was  subdivided 
into  two  portions,  thus  forming  four  ráitlie, 
or  "  quarters,"  but  no  arrangement  of  months 
appears.  On  the  eve  of  Samhain  the  Feis 
Teamhrach,  or  great  assembly  of  Notables 
at  Tara,  was  solemnly  opened  every  third 
year,  and  in  other  ways  the  date  seems  to 
have  marked  "  Le  Jour  de  I'an  "  among  the 
Celts.  In  next  month's  number  we  shall 
copy  from  Dr.  O'Donovan's  "  Introduction  " 
to  "  The  Book  of  Rights,"  his  learned  essay 
on  the  "  Division  of  the  Year  among  the 
Ancient  Irish." 


THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


The  much  admired  poem  entitled  "  Re- 
surgam,"  printed  on  page  i6,  has  been  I 
copied  and  quoted  from  b}-  many  journals 
and  newspapers.  The  Daily  Nems  speaks 
of  the  author  as  the  "poet  of  the  Gaelic 
Union." 

Rev.  John  E.  Nolan,  O.D.C.,  Hon.  Sec. 
to  the  Gaelic  Union,  purposes  in  an  early 
number  to  recount  the  historj'  of  the  move- 
ment set  on  foot  by  him  for  the  preserva- 
tion of  our  native  language,  over  which  he 
has  watched  so  sedulously,  and  for  which  he 
has  worked  so  zealously. 

We  are  obliged  to  hold  over  for  next 
number  the  first  of  a  series  of  articles  in 
Irish,  by  Mr.  Thomas  Flannery,  on  the  use 
of  "  the  word  Cii  in  Irish  name.s,"  and  which 
is  in  type.  We  shall  also  shortly  print  from 
the  pen  of  this  practical  Irish  scholar  a  care- 
ful and  learned  review  of  the  Gaelic  Praj-er 
Book — "An  Casán  go  Flaitheamhnas,"— 
recently  published  by  Rev.  John  E.  Nolan. 

There  are  few,  indeed,  who  have  laboured 
for  the  cause  of  the  Irish  language  so 
earnestly,  unselfishly  and  ably  as  has 
Thomas  O'Neill  Russell,  for  the  past  twenty 
}'ears.  We  are  glad  to  see  that  he  has  not 
yet  wearied  of  well-doing,  and  it  is  a  source 
of  great  gratification  to  us  that  his  name 
appears  among  the  contributors  to  our  first 
number.  He  has  also  promised  to  continue 
in  behalf  of  our  present  venture  that  whole- 
hearted support  he  has  always  given  to  our 
efforts. 

Among  the  contributors  to  our  next  num- 
ber will  be  P.  W.  Joyce,  LL.D.,  author  of 
the  "  Irish  Names  of  Places"  (two  series), 
an  Irish  Grammar  and  other  works. 

An  apology  is  due  to  our  Subscribers  for 
the  great  delay  in  the  publication  of  this 
number,  which  we  fully  expected  ourselves 
would  have  seen  the  light  at  farthest  before 
the  middle  of  the  month  which  is  now 
drawing  to  a  close.  Our  arrangements, 
however,  being  now  completed,  we  expect 
that  the  December  part  will  not  be  far  behind 
its  nominal  date,  and  the  January-  part  we 
shall  endeavour  to  have  ready  before  the 
close  of  the  present  year,  so  that  at  least  in 
1883  we  may  start  fairly  with  a  clear 
conscience.  We  were  loth  to  alter  the  date 
of  this  number,  as  we  are  hopeful  that  the 


unforeseen  delays  which  attended  its  pro- 
duction can  scarcely  occur  again. 

Mr.  John  Sullivan,  of  St.  Helier's,  Jersey, 
has  favoured  us  with  a  French  version  of 
'■  The  Exile  of  Erin,"  which  we  print  this 
month.  We  also  give,  among  the  "  Opinions 
of  the  Press,"  Mr.  Sullivan's  remarks  on  our 
provisional  circular  in  his  paper,  the  Jersey 
Observer.  We  shall  shortly  print  Collins' 
Irish  translation  of  "The  Exile  of  Erin," 
which  is  certainly  not  second  even  to  the 
original.  Our  present  number,  by  the  way, 
bears  something  of  a  polyglot  character. 
It  is  pleasant  to  find  Irishmen  and  friends 
of  the  Irish  cause  noticing  our  effort  in  un- 
expected quarters. 

Owing  to  the  great  variety  of  matters  de- 
manding our  attention  for  this  first  number, 
we  have  to  defer  the  publication  of  the  List 
of  Subscribers,  which  will  commence  in  the 
second,  and  be  continued  in  succeeding 
numbers.  As  all  subscriptions  are  payable 
in  advance,  only  the  names  of  those  who 
have  paid  up  will  be  given.  Intending 
Subscribers  are  earnestly  requested  to  for- 
ward their  proposed  subscriptions  or  dona- 
tions before  the  issue  of  the  second  number. 
The  Council  of  the  Gaelic  Union  has  re- 
centl)-  decided  that  all  Members  of  their 
Society  subscribing  at  least  ten  shillings 
per  annum,  not  in  arrcar,  will  receive  a  copy 
free  of  the  Journal  each  month.  All  monej-s 
are  to  be  made  payable  to  the  Hon.  Trea- 
surer, Michael  Cusack,  Esq.,  4  Gardiner 's- 
place,  Dublin. 

A  large  number  of  circulars  and  forms 
for  enrolling  Subscribers  are  still  on  hands, 
and  may  be  had,  post  free,  for  distribution, 
on  application  by  letter  to  the  Hon.  Secre- 
tarj'.  The  Report  issued  for  1880,  and 
the  Pamphlet  of  Rules,  &c.,  issued  in  the 
present  jear,  may  also  be  had. 

Rev.  Patrick  O'Keeffe,  C.C,  Fethard,  Co. 
Tipperary,  a  member  of  the  Council,  has 
produced  a  book,  now  well  known,  entitled 
"Moral  Discourses."  As  Mr.  John  Fleming, 
another  member  of  the  Council,  and  a  well- 
known  Irish  scholar,  is  engaged  in  trans- 
lating this  work  into  Irish,  we  hope  to  be 
able  to  publish  in  future  numbers  his  Irish 
version  of  some  of  these  discourses.  His 
.classic  style  may  be  judged  by  the  first 


THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


article  in  this  number,  which  is  from  his 
pen,  and  which  is  "as  good  as  a  picture." 
The  very  "look"  of  it  in  print  would  do 
good  to  one  who  did  not  even  know  Irish 
as  the  old  lady  did  Greek,  "  by  sight." 

It  may  be  necessary  to  remark  that  this 
journal  is  not  a  commercial  speculation, 
nor  has  it  any  connection  with  any  project 
whatever  founded  as  a  source  of  gain  to  the 
promoters.  No  one  has  in  it  any  personal 
interest  of  a  pecuniary  or  profitable  nature. 
It  is  the  property  of  the  Gaelic  Union,  who 
have  collected  a  small  fund  by  way  of 
"subsidy,"  and  which  with  the  subscriptions 
they  believe  will  be  sufficient  for  its  sup- 
port. 

In  our  next  number,  amongst  other  good 
intentions,  we  hope  to  be  able  to  commence 
a  "  Notes  and  Queries "  Department,  a 
column  for  "  Folklore,"  a  space  for  "  Desi- 
derata," and  "  Answers  "  to  Correspondents. 
For  "  Folklore  "  we  have  already  a  fair  col- 
lection ;  and  Rev.  Mr.  Cleaver  and  other 
friends  have  lately  favoured  us  with  some 
interesting  specimens  to  begin  with. 

The  Literary  Committee  appointed  with 
the  Editor  to  examine  all  articles  chosen 
for  insertion  in  this  journal,  consisting  of 
Rev.  M.  H.  Close,  M.A.,  and  Rev.  J.  J. 
O'Carroll,  S.J.,  is  a  sufficient  guarantee  that 
the  principles  on  which  it  is  founded, namely, 
"  non-interference  "  in  controversy,  either 
touching  religion  or  politics,  will  be  strictly 
adhered  to.  On  this  point  it  may  not  be 
out  of  place  to  quote  from  Christopher 
Anderson's  "  Native  Irish  and  their  De- 
scendants "  a  few  remarks  which  seem  very 
well  suited  to  the  present  case.  He  writes  : — 

A  very  clieap  periodical  work,  if  well  conducted  b) 
a  man  of  principle,  who,  upon  certain  subjects,  well 
understood  the  doctrine  of  non-interference,  but  was 
thoroughly  imbued  wiih  the  desire  of  benefiting  his 
countrymen  in  every  w.-iy,  cautious  of  admitting  speculative 
opinions,  and  determined  to  insert  no  mere  idle  reports, 
on  whatever  authority,  but  resolved  to  put  the  native 
Iriah  reader  of  the  day  in  possession  of  what  is  intlubitable 
as  to  nature,  science  and  art,  would  be  of  essential  service. 
There  is  not  a  people  upon  earth  who  would  read  such  a 
thing  with  as  much  avidity,  nor  would  any  reader  have 
a  greater  number  of  such  ea;;er  hearers. 

It  shall  be  our  desire  to  conciliate  all  who 
wish  well  to  the  Irish  language  ;  the  sus- 
ceptibilities of  all  must  be  respected,  and 


no  friend  kept  out  of  the  ranks  by  petty 
jealousy  or  private  spleen,  so  long  as  he  is 
willing  to  work  heartily  and  honestly.

rilK  •■  TIMES"  ON  THE  GAELIC  MOVEMENT. 

Tu  THE  Editor  of  the  "Gaelic  Journal." 

Sir, — While  all  agree  that  the  article  on  the  Gaelic 
Union  Circular  in  the  Times  of  the  4th  ult.  is  a  production 
of  very  great  \-ii^our  and  ability,  very  many  coinplain  of 
the  tone  of  some  passages  in  it.  I  do  not.  I  think  the 
article  veiy  fair,  nay,  very  favourable,  as  things  appear 
from  the  writer's  point  of  view.  He  would  be  very  glad 
that  an  "  indigenous  tongue — a  distinct  variety  of  human 
speech,"  such  as  is  the  Irish  language,  should  be  preserved. 
But  as  seen  from  his  stand-point  he  believes  that  all  things 
forebode  its  destruction,  and  that  the  atternpts  of  us  who 
are  striving  to  preserve  it  are  idle  and  Quixotic.  But  I 
believe  that  our  objects  are  feasible,  and  that  I  can  show 
this  to  the  writer  of  the  article,  and  to  the  thousands  who 


26 


THE   GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


think  with  him.  And  what  are  these  objects?  To  banish  the 
English  certainly  is  not  one  of  ti.em.  It  is  the  language 
of  commerce,  science,  art,  and  so  on  ;  let  it  remain  such. 
The  promoters  of  the  Gaelic  Union — many  of  them — are 
admirers  of  the  English  language  and  of  its  noble  litera- 
ture. With  the  language  of  Shakespeare  and  Newton  we 
are  well  satisfied — nor  yet  would  we  require  a  single  defi- 
nition in  the  works  of  S.almon  or  Casey  to  be  translated 
into  Irish.  We  are  stri\ing  to  keep  the  Irish  tongue  alive 
where  it  is  still  spoken  as  long  as  we  can  ;  we  w'ish  to 
have  all  the  local  words  in  the  language  taken  down  while 
those  who  know  these  words  are  slill  alive.  We  also  wish 
all  the  songs  or  fragments  of  songs,  poems,  proverbs, 
foiklore,  traditions,  manners,  customs,  to  be  written  as 
soon  as  possible,  before  the  old  Irish-speaking  people 
leave  us  ;  we  wish  to  create  an  intere>t  in  the  language 
that  people  may  learn  it  in  order  to  take  down  these 
things.  There  are,  moreover,  in  the  Rojal  Irish  Academy. 
in  Trinity  College,  &c.,  piles  of  Irish  manuscripts — manu- 
script treasures  as  they  are  thought  l>y  the  ripest  scholars 
of  Germany,  France,  Italy,  and  other  countries.  These 
scholars  think  the  Irish  manuscripts  worth  translating  into 
the  languages  of  their  respective  countries  ;  and  in  order 
t")  fit  themselves  for  the  task  of  translating  them  they  learn 
Irish,  of  course  as  a  dead  language.  Hut  there  are  so 
many  idioms  in  Irish — they  are  almost  innumerable — and 
the  shades  of  difference  between  the  meanings  of  many  of 
these  idioms  are  so  nice,  that  it  is  a  life-long  labour  to  a 
foreigner  to  master  them,  if  he  can  ever  master  them  at 
all.  Those  who  speak  the  language  in  early  life  have  no 
difficulty  in  understanding  the  meaning  of  these  idioms — 
even  the  illiterate  never  commit  mistakes  in  the  applica- 
tion of  them.  It  is  only  Irish-speaking  scholars,  then, 
that  can  rightly  understand,  translate,  and  explain  these 
idioms,  and  we  wish  the  language  to  be  preserved  alive 
until  the  last  page  of  our  manuscript  materials  is  secured 
for  the  scholars  of  the  world  ;  and  we  wish  the  Irish  to  be 
taught  to  Irish-speakiug  children  from  infancy  in  the 
schools,  and  the  English  language  through  it  as  a  medium, 
that  so  these  little  Cells  may  be  brought  up  as  rational 
beings,  and  that  the  gifted  among  them  may'leam  the  new 
science  of  comparative  philolog)',  and  in  this  way  be  pie- 
pared  to  give  our  manuscripts  to  the  world  of  letters.  No 
one  will  say  that  the  people  of  Ireland  are  not  as  capable 
of  learning  philolŷgy  as  their  Ar)-an  kinsmen  of  the  Con- 
tinent ;  and  surely  with  equal  culture  they  can  understand 
their  own  language  better  than  any  other  people  in  the 
world.  All  along  the  sea-board  and  in  the  islands,  from 
the  Foyle  to  Waterford  Harbour,  the  people  speak  Irish  : 
we  wish,  then,  especially  for  the  reasons  given  abo\'e,  thai 
the  children  should  be  taught  Irish  al  first  in  the  schools, 
at  home,  everywhere.  But  would  not  this  be  sacrificing 
the  children?  The  localities  specified  above  are  the 
poorest  in  Ireland  ;  the  children  in  these  localities  are 
soonest  taken  from  school — would  it  not  be  belter,  then, 
to  have  the  children  taught  as  they  are  now,  /..■.,  English 
at  first,  and  during  all  the  time  they  remain  at  school  ? 
Let  us  see. 

In  one  portion  of  a  school  district  in  Donegal  there 
were,  four  or  five  years  since,  30,000  e.\clusively  Irish- 
speaking  people.  No  attempt  had  ever  been  made  in  a 
single  instance  m  th  s  district  to  turn  to  any  account  the 
pupils'  knowledge  of  Irish.  The  children  seeing  turf  at 
home  and  in  the  bog  since  infancy  could  not  say  what 
turf  is,  or  what  is  a  bog.  It  is  the  Inspector  of  the  district 
that  tells  this  in  a  Blue-book.  It  must  be  allowed  that 
these  children  did  not  gain  much  by  being  taught  in  Eng- 
lish during  their  time  at  school.  In  February,  iSSo, 
the  correspondent  of  a  Dublin  daily  paper  thus  describes 


the  state  of  education  in  a  portion  of  Kerry  : — "In  all  the 
vast  district  lying  to  the  west  of  Dingle  scarcely  a  word  of 
English  is  spoken.  ...  In  Coumeenole  not  a  single 
individual  in  the  village  could  speak  a  word  of  English, 
and  the  young  children,  though  they  attend  school,  and 
are  able  to  read  the  third  and  fourth  books  tolerably  well, 
feel  wholly  at  a  loss  to  comprehend  any  question  addressed 
to  them  in  English."  It  may  be  said  that  these  children 
were  incorrigibly  stupid.  No  such  thing  :  had  the  In- 
spector or  the  correspondent  been  able  to  question  them 
in  Irish,  he  would  have  got  intelligent  answers.  Fifty 
years  ago,  the  Right  Rev.  Dr.  Abram,  Bishop  of  Water- 
ford  and  Lismore,  said  of  such  Irish-speaking  children  : — 
"The  Uttle  countrj-  children  presented  to  me  for  Con- 
firmation who  had  been  taught  the  Christian  Doctrine 
in  their  tialive  lnyr^tiagi\  as  far  surpassed,  in  the  knowledge 
of  their  re'igion,  the  children  taught  in  the  English  lan- 
guage, as  the  rational  being  suipasses  in  solid  sense  the 
chattering  jay."  Dr.  Abram  had  been  President  of  St. 
John's  College,  Waterford,  and  Professor  in  the  Collie, 
too.  and  no  more  strict  and  methodical  educationist  could 
be  found,  nor  any  person  less  prone  to  exaggeration.  It 
may  be  added  that  the  children  of  the  very  highest  classes 
only,  or  the  chiklren  in  the  larger  towns,  were  at  that  time 
taught  the  English  Catechism,  whereas  all  the  poorer 
children,  servants,  and  such,  one-half  of  whom  never 
entered  a  school  door,  were  taught  in  Irish.  Had  these 
latter  been  questioned  in  English,  a  moiety  of  them,  I  am 
sure,  would  fail  in  telling  what  turf  is  or  what  is  a  bog. 

As  regards  the  Irish  language,  then,  Ireland  may  be 
divided  into  two  districts — the  first  comprising  all  the 
localities  in  which  the  language  is  still  spoken,  and  the 
other,  all  those  where  the  language  has  died  out.  The 
former  district  may  be  roughly  taken  as  the  sea-board  and 
islands  already  described.  In  this  district  the  greater 
portion  of  the  people  are  more  or  less  bilingual,  though  in 
many  parts  of  it  they  are  exclusively  Irish-speaking,  or 
nearly  so,  as,  for  instance,  the  thirty  thousand  in  Donegal 
already  mentioned,  the  people  to  the  west  of  Dingle,  in 
Kerry,  and  the  great  majority  of  the  inhabitants  of  Con- 
nemara.  Perhaps  the  best  idea  of  what  kind  the  exclu- 
sively Irish-speaking  people  are,  may  be  fonned  from  the 
"Report  of  the  Medical  Commission  of  the  Mansion 
House  Committee,"  by  George  Siger>on,  M.D.*  Speak- 
ing of  Camus,  a  locality  in  the  west  of  the  County  Gal- 
way,  Mr.  Tuke,  as  quoted  at  p.  31  of  the  Report,  says  : — 

'■  There  you  see,  peering  above  the  rocks,  little  dark 
heads  of  men,  women  and  children,  attracted  by  the  un- 
wonted sight,  come  out  of  their  cabins  to  reconnoitre.  As 
you  walk  among  them  on  landing,  they  watch  you  with 
curious  eyes :  they  do  not  beg,  and  cannot  answer 
your  inquiries,  for  most  of  thein  do  not  understand,  .and 
few  can  talk  En<;lisli,"  &c. 

On  this  passage  Dr.  Sigerson  remarks  :  "  The  reference 
which  Mr.  Tuke  makes  to  the  prevalence  of  the  Irish 
langu.ige  here,  may  also  be  applied  to  other  districts. 
Indeed,  in  almost  all  the  localities  we  visited,  a  know- 
ledge of  the  Gaelic  language  must  be  requisite  for  the  full 
performance  of  their  duties,  by  all  who,  like  clergymen, 
physicians  and  others,  have  to  deal  closely  with  the  peo- 
ple. Medical  terms  are  not,  for  instance,  well  under- 
stood, even  by  those  peasants  who  speak  English,  and 
mistaken  answers  have  been  given  (e.g.,  tending  to  con- 
found ^í'/Atí/í/ with  typhus),  as  was  ascertained  by  ques- 
tioning the  speakers  in  their  native  tongue.  Then  they 
express  themselves  with  correctness,  and  often  with 
remarkable  ^race."

Not  much  more  literate  than  these  little  Celts  were  some 
of  the  parents  of  the  children  in  the  mountainous  parts  of 
the  County  of  Waterford  fifty  years  ago,  when  Dr.  Abram 
fo\md  the  little  mountaineers  such  a»  he  describes  ihem  ; 
and  such  the  dark-headed  children  of  Camus  would  be 
found  by  an  examiner  like  Dr.  Abram,  «ho  knew  how  to 
question  them  in  their  native  tongue.  In  the  three  loca- 
lities enumerated  there  are  at  least  100,000  souls,  and 
there  are  many  other  similar  localities  along  tlie  sea-board 
district. 

Now  it  is  to  the  promoters  of  the  Gaelic  Union  incom- 
prehensible how  educationists  should  persist  in  teaching 
these  poor  children  of  the  Irish-speaking  districts  after 
the  irrational  fashion  they  are  following.  Had  the  little 
group  at  Camus,  for  instance,  been  a  colony  from  the 
banks  of  the  Seine,  lately  introduced  into  Ireland  to  carry 
on  some  industrial  manutacture,  would  the  children  among 
them,  in  the  tir4  instance,  be  taught  through  the  Eni;lish 
language  as  a  medium  and  by  a  teacher  ignorant  of  any 
other  language  ?  No  one  in  Ireland  would  recommend 
such  a  course.  But  the  Irish-speaking  children  of  Camus, 
and  of  such  other  localities,  are  as  ignorant  of  the  English 
language  as  so  many  French  children  ;  why  then  not  treat 
them  as  French  children  in  like  circumstances  would  be 
treated  ? 

'I'iie  Times  goes  on  to  say  ;   *'  The  Gaelic  Union,  how- 
ever, is  not  at  all  satisfied  to  devote  itself  to  an  archaeological 
inquiry.     Its  purpose  is  to  recall  the  common  employment 
of  Irish  as  a  medmm  of  communication     ....     But 

a  language  as  a  national  instrument  cannot  be  kept  in  life 
because  its  heirs,  many  or  few,  desire  to  preserve  it.     If  it 
be  requisite  for  the  general  purposes  of  national  existence, 
it  will  survive  as  Welsh  and  Breton  has  survived.     .     .     . 

The  British  connexion  ....  has  reconstructed  Irish  exist- 
ence and  nationality  on  a  model  to  which  the  ancient  Irish 
language  is  alien.     Gaelic  does  not  express  modern  Irish 
wants  and  ideas.    They  are  expressed  in  English. 
Had  Irishmen  continued  to  speak  Irish,  a  majority  of  them 
would  have  learnt  English  also,  as  a  majority  of  Welshmen 
learn  English,  and  a  majority  of  Bretons  French.     .     .     . 

H.id  there  been  purely  Irish  thouglits  for  which  Irish  was 
the  sole  vehicle,  the  language  would  never  have  become 
obsolete.     As  it  is,   the  resumed  use  of  Irish  woidfl   be 
simply  for  the  translation  of  thoughts  from  the  English,  in 
which  they  are  born,  into  a  dialect  as  foreign  to  Irishmen 
.     ,     .     as  English  was  to  the  men  of  Connaught  in 
the  days  of  Queen  Elizabeth.     ...     To  lavish  ardour 

in  bribing  teachers  and  school-children  to  learn  a  language 
which   can   teach   them  nothing,  and  by  which  they  can 
teach  nothing,  is  like   endowing  a  day  labourer  with  a 
machine  to  test  gold,       ....... 

Irishmen  are  slirewi.1  enough  not  to  be  tempted  in  large 
numbers  to  the  unremunerative   outlay  of  brain  power 
....    Many  creatures   ....    are  most  interesting  as 

specimens  which  are  neither  desirable  nor  possible  subjects 
of  cultivation     .     .     .     .     It    is  a  pity  that  admirers  of 

its  very  real  antiquarian  riches  (i.e.,  of  the  Irish  language) 
should  waste  on  the  vain  effort  to  force  back  upon  their 
countryman  a  piece  of  furniture  they  had  already  turned 
out  ol  doors,  labour  which  might  be  fruitfully  spent  in 
fitting  it  for  safe  and  honourable  deposit  among  the  trea- 
sures of  the  National  Museum." 

The  writer  appears  to  think  that  the  Irish  language  is 
actually  dead,  and  that  nothing  remains  but  to  lay  it  out 
decently,  and  to  fit  it  for  a  res|  'ectable  place  in  the  National 
Museum,  where  archaeological  inquiries  can  be  held  over 
**  its  very  real  antiquarian  riches."  These  antiquarian 
riches,  if  printed,  would  fill,  on  the  authority  of  the  late 
Professor  O'Curry,  over  30,000   quarto  pages  of  letter- 


press ;  they  are  now  in  manuscript,  unpublished,  unedited, 
untranslated,  laid  out  in  the  Royal  Irish  Academy,  in 
Trinity  College,  Dublin,  &c.,  &c.  And  how  many 
scholars  in  the  world  now  really  capable  of  eiliting  these 
manuscript  riches  ?  Could  the  number  be  counted  on  the 
fingers  of  two  hands  ?  There  are,  I  know,  two  natives  of 
Ireland  among  them,  Mr.  Whitley  Stokes  and  Mr.  W. 
INI.  Hennessy.  We  have  had  in  Ireland  for  nearly  a 
century  archaeological  and  antiquarian  societies,  and 
valuable  work  they  have  done  in  editing  and  publishing 
many  of  our  manuscripts  ;  but  those  who  have  done  this 
work  have  almost  all  left  us,  and  to  this  pass  we  have  now 
come,  that  if  the  elucidation  of  these  antiquaiian  riches  be 
left  to  archaeological  inquirers,  the  people  of  the  globe  in 
2S82  may  expect  to  see  the  last  page  of  them  issue  from  the 
press,  but  not  in  a  very  correct  shape,  for  when  the  Irish 
language  is  in  its  winding  sheet,  no  one  can  understand 
its  idioms.  Those  who  w'ould  preserve  the  Irish 
language  are  altogether  concerned  about  the  people  in 
the  Irish-speaking  districts.  They  will,  of  course,  gladly 
encourage  and  help  all  who  desire  to  study  the  language 
of  the  country,  but  they  would  prefer  seeing  the  little 
dark-headed  children  of  Camus  taught  Irish  at  first  in  the 
schools,  and  next  taught  English  through  it  as  a  medium, 
to  seeing  ten  times  as  many  in  the  non-Irish  localities 
learn  it  as  a  dead  language.  That  the  Breton  and  tlie 
Welsh  have  survived  is  not  clue  to  any  fitness  of  things 
in  either  language  ;  the  Breton  is  still  the  spoken  langiuage 
of  Bretagne,  though  the  French  Government  have  u^ed 
every  means  to  extinguish  it,  even  to  the  forbidding  of  its 
being  taught  in  the  schools.  A  gentleman  from  Scotland 
who  had  made  a  tour  in  the  province  about  four  years 
since,  in  a  paper  published  in  the  Transactions  of  the 
Gaelic  Society  of  Inverness,  explained  the  reasons 
why  it  is  still  alive.  The  Bretons  are  as  devoted  to 
their  priests  as  any  people  on  earth,  and  their  priests 
love  the  old  language  of  their  country,  and  hence  its 
preservation. 

As  to  the  language  of  Wales  and  its  people,  "  the 
whole  country  was  in  a  most  deplorable  state  with  regard 
to  the  acquisition  of  religious  knowledge  "  previous  to  the 
year  1730,  when  the  Rev.  Griffith  Jones,  of  Llandower, 
made  the  first  attempt  of  any  importance,  on  an  extensive 
scale,  to  erect  schools  for  the  instruction  of  the  people  to 
read  their  native  language.  He,  in  allusion  to  the  en- 
deavours of  those  who  would  banish  Welsli  by  teaching 
English,  asks  in  one  of  his  letters  : — "  Should  all  our 
Welsh  books,  and  our  excellent  version  of  the  Holy  Bible, 
and  Welsh  preaching  ...  be  taken  away  to  bring  us  to 
a  disuse  of  our  tongue  ?  So  they  are  in  a  manner  in  some 
places,  and  yet  the  people  are  no  more  better  scholars 
than  they  are  better  Christians  for  it."  This  good  man 
lived  for  thirty  years  after  this  date,  and  during  these 
years  he  laboured  unceasingly  to  ])reserve  his  native 
tongue,  and,  as  a  matter  of  course,  he  was  able  to  bring 
many  others  to  his  own  way  of  thinking,  and  to  engage 
them  zealously  in  his  work.  Among  these  was  a  pious 
lady  of  fortune,  Mrs.  Be\an,  who  survived  him  several 
years,  and  by  will  left  ten  tlwusiiiid {•onmis,  the  interest 
of  which  was  to  be  applied  for  ever  to  the  use  of  the 
schools  founded  by  him.  The  will  was  disputed  by  her 
niece,  who  got  the  case  into  Chanceiy,  where  it  coniinued 
for  thirty  years  ;  but  it  was  at  last  declared  valid,  and  the 
accumulated  interest  was  tlien  applied  to  the  support  of 
circulating  charity  schools  througliout  the  whole  prin- 
cipality. The  number  of  Mr.  Jones'  schools,  it  may 
be  mentioned,  amounted  to  tu'o  hundred  and  iiveaty 
during  his  Ifeiime  ;  yet  there  were  many  mountainous 
districts  without  any  schools,  and  to  one  of  these  districts

THE   GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


the  Rev.  Mr.  Charles,  of  Bal.a,  on  whom  the  mantle  of 
Mr.  Jones  had  fallen,  was  appointed. 

This  excellent  clerg)-man  tried  every  means  to  have  the 
people  of  these  districts  instructed  in  Welsh.  He  asked 
for  subscriptions,  employed  teachers,  trained  them  him- 
self, wrote  catechisms  and  other  elementar)-  works  in  that 
language.  His  zeal  and  unselfishness  soon  brought  him 
subscriptions,  and  enabled  him  to  found  more  schools. 
On  introducing  one  to  any  place,  he  previously  visited  the 
place,  called  upon  the  influential  inhabitants,  and  upon 
the  parents  of  the  future  scholars,  he  spoke  kindly  to  the 
children,  showed  the  parents  the  blessings  of  education 
for  their  children,  promised  to  assist  them  with  books  if  they 
were  too  poor  to  buy  them  ;  the  teacher  was  to  take  no 
entrance  money ;  not  to  encroach  on  the  people,  nor  intrude 
upon  tliem  unless  specially  invited  into  their  houses. 
Surely  it  was  no  wonder  that  the  language  of  Wales  should 
rr-'ize.  The  people  after  a  time  became  so  interested  in 
it  th;it  the  necessity  of  these  day  schools  was  superseded 
by  the  increase  of  Sunday  schools,  and  these  have  brought 
Welsh  to  have  a  flourishing  literature  of  its  own. 

The  term  "revive"  above  has  been  used  designedly, 
for  the  same  baleful  influences  had  been  at  work  in  Wales 
that  proved  so  dis.astrous  in  Ireland.  The  Rev.  Mr. 
Charles  says:  "At  first  the  strong  prejudice  which 
universally  prevailed  against  teaching  them  to  read 
Welsh  first,  and  the  idea  assumed  that  they  could  not 
learn  English  so  well  \\  previously  instructed  in  the  Welsh 
language — this,  I  say,  proved  a  great  stumbling-block  in 
the  way  of  parents  to  send  children  to  tlie  Welsh  schools, 
together  with  another  conceit  they  had,  that  if  tliey  could 
read  English  they  would  soon  learn  of  themselves  to  read 
Welsh  ;  but  now  these  idle  and  groundless  conceits  are 
universally  scouted.  This  change  has  been  produced  not 
so  much  by  disputing  as  by  the  evident  salutary  effects  of 
the  Schools,  the  great  delight  with  which  the  children 
attended  them,  and  the  progress  they  made  in  the  acqui- 
sition of  knowledge.  The  school  continues  usually  at  one 
time  in  the  same  place  six  or  nine  months,  &c."  This  is 
the  way^that  the  language  of  Wales  was  saved  from  be- 
coming obsolete. 

These  extracts  awaken  thoughts  of  a  painful  nature.  On 
the  same  year  that  saw  the  Rev.  Griffith  Jones  entering  on 
his  life-long  mission  for  the  instruction' of  the  Welsh  in 
their  own  language,  an  Irishman,  equally  patriotic.  Hugh 
MacCurtin,  a  native  of  Clare,  had  prepared  for  publication 
an  English-Irish  dictionarj-,  which,  with  the  brief  Irish 
grammar  appended  to  it,  contains  700  pages.  But  it  was 
in  exile  in  Paris  he  compiled  this  work.  It  was  published 
there  through  the  friendly  exertions  of  a  patriotic  priest. 
the  Rev.  Conor  O'Uegley.  MacCurtin  w.is  an  ardent 
lover  of  his  native  language,  which  he  said  is  "copious  and 
elegant  in  expression  ....  though  it  has  been  declining 
these  five  hundred  years  past,  whereas  all  the  modern 
tongues  of  Europe  have  been  polishing  and  refining  all 
that  time."  In  an  introductoiy  Irish  poem  he  calls  on  the 
"nobles  of  Ireland,  the  heirs  of  affectionate  generations, 
to  forsake  their  letharg)-  and  [help  him]  to  ur^îe  on  the 
earnest  publication  of  their  books."  He  complains  of  this 
long  fit  of  torpor  which  had  come  upon  them  all,  "even 
on  their  wives  and  children."  causing  them  to  "forget  the 
ancient  tongue  of  their  ancestors,  the  enlightened  dis- 
courses of  their  fathers. "  He  had  in  prepar.ation  an  Irish- 
English  dictionar)';  it  never  saw  the  light,  any  more  than 
the  other  works  he  had  compiled  for  publication. 

Of  the  nobles  of  Erin,  the  Venerable  Ch.arles  O'Connor, 
of  Belenagar,  only  gave  heed  to  his  appeal,  and  Irish  w.ts 
then  a  proscribed  tongue  ;  it  was  but  a  few  years  before 
that  Dean  Swift  said :  "It  would  bç  a  noble  achievement 


to  abolish  the  Irish  language  ...  so  far  at  least  as 
to  oblige  all  the  natives  to  speak  only  English  on  every 
occasion  of  business,  in  shops,  markets,  fairs "... 
and  this  he  believed  might  be  done  in  half  an  age  .  .  . 
and  at  a  cost  of  six  thousand  pounds  a-year,  or  three  hun- 
dred thousand  pounds  in  all.  Fashion  naturally  was 
equally  against  the  proscribed  tongue.  "I  have  heard 
maiiy  gentlemen  among  us  talk  much  of  the  great  con- 
venience to  those  who  live  in  this  country  that  they  should 
speak  Irish.  It  may  possibly  be  so  ;  but  I  think  they 
should  be  such  as  never  intend  to  visit  England,  upon  pain 
of  being  ridiculous."  (Hardy's  Life  of  Lord  Charlemont.) 
The  proscription  fell  into  abeyance,  but  the  cursed  fashion 
flourished.  Those  who  intended  to  visit  England  were 
heard  to  speak  disparagingly  of  the  Irish  tongue;  their 
underlings  took  up  the  same  tone ;  from  these  it  went  down 
to  the  temants  and  cottiers.  The  natural  parental  affection 
of  the  Irish  pe.asant  gave  way  to  his  desire  for  his  child's 
welfare.  He  directed  the  brutal  hedge  school  abecederian 
to  put  a  tally  under  his  child's  neck,  and  should  the  child 
speak  a  word  of  the  only  language  he  could  articulate 
there  w.ts  a  notch  inserted  in  the  tally,  and  very  often  the 
child's  back  was  cut  with  the  cat-o'-nine-tails. 

No  wonder  the  fitness  of  things  made  the  Irish  die  out 
altogether  in  the  greater  part  of  the  central  plain  of  Ire- 
land. And  what  have  the  inhabitants  of  this  central  plain 
gained  by  the  extirpation  of  their  native  tongue  from 
amongst  them  ?  Have  they  become  more  intelligent  ? 
Have  their  children  become  more  intelligent  ?  It  is 
well  known  to  all  that  in  the  National  Schools  of 
Ireland  there  is  a  system  of  results'  payments— that  is,  a 
pupil  that  passes  in  any  branch  of  school  learning  corns  a 
fee  for  the  teacher.  The  test  questions  are  the  same  for 
all  schools,  and,  of  course,  the  most  intelligent  child  earns 
most  results'  fees.  In  the  English-speaking  plain  the 
children  have  never  yet  heard  a  word  of  Irish ;  their 
fathers  heard  none  ;  the  grandfathers  m,ay  have  heard  a 
few  words  when  children.  Outside  the  plain  and  in  the 
islands  the  majority  of  the  people  are  bilingual :  some  are, 
as  was  said,  exclusively  Irish  ;  and  some  are  trying  to  for- 
get Irish  and  to  learn  English.  These  latter  children  are, 
says  the  highest  living  authority,  the  most  stupid  children  he 
ever  met ;  they  consequently  can  earn  scarcely  any  results' 
fees.  The  exclusively  Irish-speaking,  though  intelligent, 
can  earn  but  very  little,  because  the  Inspectors,  as  a  rule, 
being  ignorant  of  the  language,  cannot  draw  out  the  in- 
telligence of  the  pupils.  These  two  classes  of  Irish- 
speaking  children  reduce  the  amount  of  average  results' 
fees  earned  by  the  pupils  who  are  bilingual.  In  the 
English-speaking  counties  the  teachers  are  as  good  as  in 
the  other  counties,  and  all  the  appliances  are  more  favour- 
able. In  which,  then,  are  the  highest  results'  fees  earned 
by  the  pupils?  Underneath  is  a  contr.asted  table  of  the 
nrrra^i  amounts  earne  1  in  some  of  the  best  districts  of 
both  classes — it  tells  its  own  tale.

Why  are  the  Irish -speaking  pupils  so  much  in  advance? 
And  would  it  be  generous  or  fair  to  put  an  end  to  the 
intelligence  that  enables  them  to  be  thus  in  advance? 

As  for  this  mclrked  superior  intelligence  in  the  children, 
the  fact  is  patent ;  it  would  be,  perhaps,  just  now  in- 
vidious to  account  for  it.  Tliat  the  children  who  are 
tiying  to  forget  Iri^h  and  learn  English  should  be  the 
dullest,  as  Sir  Patrick  iCeenan  says,  is  easily  understood. 
In  the  memorial  on  Irish-teaching  in  schools,  unanimously 
agreed  to  by  the  National  Teachers  in  their  Congress  in 
1874,  it  is  stated  that:  "The  parents  in  Irish-speaking 
districts  have  not  English  enough  to  convey  their  ideas, 
except  such  as  relate  to  the  mechanical  business  of  their 
occupation.  Hence  they  are  not  able  in  any  degree  to 
cultivate  or  inform  the  minds  of  their  children  (though 
often  very  intelligent  themselves),  who  consequently  grow 
up  dull  and  stupid  if  they  have  been  suffered  to  lose  the 
Irish  language,  or  to  drop  out  of  the  constant  practice 
of  it." 

It  may  be  added  here  that  Clare,  where  the  highest  re- 
sults' fees  in  Ireland  have  been  earned,  is  the  most  bi- 
lingual county  in  Ireland,  i.e.,  the  county  wliere  the 
teachers,  pupils,  and  parents  speak  and  understand  both 
languages  best,  and  sthat  to  this  fact,  their  superior  in- 
telligence has  been  attributed  by  those  most  competent 
to  form  a  correct  judgment  on  the  subject.  It  may  also 
be  stated  that,  as  a  rule,  the  best  Irish  speaker  amongst 
the  pupils  is  the  be^t  and  most  intelligent  of  them. 

How  many  Irisli-speaking  children  in  the  schools  of 
Ireland  I  cannot  say.  Certainly  there  are  more  than  were 
ill  all  Wales  when  the  Rev.  Griffith  Jones  began  his 
mission.  It  will  not  injure  a  single  pupil  of  all  these  to 
learn  to  read  Irish,  and  to  those  who  speak  Irish  only,  to 
induce  them  to  try  to  forget  it  will  be  certain  to  render 
them  dull  and  stupid.  It  takes  a  long  time  to  forget 
Irish.  In  Donegal  they  were  Hying  to  do  so  for  a  quarter 
of  a  century,  when  Sir  Patrick  Keenan  found  them  ''the 
most  stupid  children  he  had  ever  met ;  "  and  after  another 
quarter  of  a  century,  tliese  children  cannot  tell  what  turl 
is  and  what  is  a  bog.  How  many  keen  Celtic  intellects 
have  been  left  fallow  in  that  half  century  !  At  any  rate, 
as  Dr.  Johnson  said  on  a  like  occasion  :  "  The  efficacy  of 
ignorance  has  long  been  tried  .  .  .  Let  knowledge 
therefore  take  its  turn."  As  to  bribing  teachers  and 
children  to  learn  Irish,  it  is  a  practice  of  old  standing. 
Nineteen  centuries  ago  the  pupils  were  bribed  with  crustula 
just  as  they  are  in  this  present  year  with  higher  premiums. 
In  the  next  issue  of  the  Journal  will  be  given  the  opinions 
of  the  most  philosophical  educationists  on  the  question 
"  How  should  bilingual  children  be  educated?" 

I  am.  Sir, 

Yours  faithfully, 

JOHN  FLEMING.

"  The    Times,"  London,  4Í/1  October,  1SS2. 

A  new  movement  is  proceeding  for  the  revival  of  Irish 
national  spirit  in  a  very  extensive  and  permanent  fashion. 
Some  years  since  a  few  gentlemen  combined  to  encourage 
the  preservation  and  cultivation  of  the  Irish  language. 
They  intended  to  pursue  their  object  by  issuing  cheap 
Gaelic  publications,  and  by  distributing  prizes  among 
teachers  and  pupils.    Very  soon  they  felt  the  need  of  an 


organ  to  explain  their  ẃws,  and  a  couple  of  years  ago 
prospectuses  were  circulated.  Calls  upon  the  leisure  of 
the  most  active  associate  compelled  a  postponement  of 
the  scheme.  Now  the  members  of  the  Union  have  re- 
solved both  to  constitute  themselves  a  regular  society, 
w^ith  affiliated  bodies  throughout  the  country,  and  also  to 
establish,  without  further  delay,  a  monthly  magazine, 
partly  English  and  partly  Irish,  though  with  a  gradual 
increase  in  the  proportion  of  the  latter.  The  contents  of 
the  paper  are  to  be  poetry  and  prose,  which  may  itself 
be  poetical,  with  any  other  variety  of  literary  genius 
which  '•  several  literary  gentlemen  who  will  be  among 
the  contributors  "  may  infuse.  The  annual  subscription 
is  five  shillings,  with  special  terms  when  parcels  are  taken 
of  six  or  more  copies.  While  Archbishop  Croke  of 
Cashel  is  the  patron,  a  security  against  the  identification 
of  "a  national  and  patriotic  endeavour  "  with  distinctions 
of  creed  and  party  is  afforded  by  the  presidency  of  the 
O'Conor  Don.  \Vith  much  self-restraint  the  committee 
has  even  refrained  from  the  national  colour'.  Its  hand- 
book positively  has  a  blue  cover.  Whether  the  pro- 
gramme is  to  be  fulfilled  and  The  Gaelic  Union  yournal 
to  appear  depends  henceforth  wholly  on  the  amount  of 
countenance  the  design  receives  from  without.  Before 
the  toth  of  October  the  Honorarj-  Secretary  must  have 
sufficient  answers  to  his  invitations  to  enable  the  first 
number  to  be  published  on  the  1st  of  November,  "the 
great  feast  of  Samhain  among  the  ancient  Irish."  The 
projectors,  who  bestow  all  their  labour  giatuitously,  very 
reasonably  refuse  to  be  put  off  with  cheap  expressions  of 
good-will.  With  all  their  economy,  they  are  already 
somewhat  in  deht ;  "it  is  support  the  society  requires, 
not  sympathy  alone."  Before  launching  into  print  it 
insists  upon  having  "such  a  number  of  names  enrolled  as 
will  allow  of  considerable  possible  defections."  Our 
sincere  admiration  of  so  remarkable  an  exhibition  of  cau- 
tion is  only  qualified  by^an  apprehension  that  it  is  scarcely 
consistent  with  the  fire  and  vivacity  of  national  enthusiasm 
necessary  to  enlist  popular  Irish  co-operation. 

All,  Saxons  or  Celts,  will  concur  with  the  Gaelic  Union 
in  wishing  that  the  Irish  language  may  be  preserved.  No 
historical  relics  can  approach  in  dignity  and  value  an  in- 
digenous tongue.  All  the  ancient  monuments  over  which 
Sir  John  Lubbock  has  been  watching  are  worth  little  in 
comparison  with  a  distinct  variety  of  human  speech.  Irish 
in  particular  is  in  want  of  care.  Englishmen  who  explored 
the  remoter  districts  of  Ireland  half  a  century  back  often 
found  themselves  where  they  could  neither  understand 
nor  be  understood.  An  experience  still  possible  for  them 
in  Wales,  and  for  Frenchmen  in  Brittany,  has  almcst 
ceased  to  be  possible  in  Ireland.  Schools  and  the  habit 
of  wandering,  and,  perhaps,  an  addition  of  intellectual  in- 
dolence, have  made  Irishmen  no  longer  bilingual.  With- 
out attention  and  vigilance  Irish  might  perish  as  Cornish 
has  perished.  Irish  antiquarians  have  to  exert  their 
utmost  zeal  to  maintain  the  philological  tradition  and 
vitality  of  a  vei-y  important  type  of  Gaelic.  They  would 
be  grateful  to  any  association  like  the  Gaelic  Union  which 
seconded  their  learned  efforts.  The  Gaelic  Union,  how- 
ever, is  not  at  all  satisfied  to  devote  itself  to  an  archseo- 
logical  inquiry.  Its  purpose  is  to  recall  the  common  em- 
ployment of  Irish  as  a  medium  of  communication.  Without 
interdicting  English  it  would  prefer  to  find  Irish  spoken 
when  the  company  was  simply  Irish.  Sensible  and 
prudent  people,  as  the  promoters  of  the  Gaelic  Union 
have  shown  themselves  in  the  preliminaries  of  their  under- 
taking, are  not  likely  to  believe  they  will  ever  succeed  in 
banishing  English.  They  hope  to  restore  Irish  for  use  in 
the  inner  circle  to  which  they  would  reserve  liberty  for

Irish  nationality  to  retire,  witlioiit  eNcliiding  itself  from  full 
participation  in  the  advantnges  of  menibeiship  in  the 
larger  community  of  the  British  Empire.  But  a  language 
as  a  national  instrument  cannot  be  kept  in  life  because  us 
heirs,  many  or  few,  Oesire  to  preserve  it.  If  it  be  requisite 
for  the  general  purposes  of  national  existence,  it  will  sur- 
vive as  Welsh  and  Breton  have  survived.  As  soon  as  its 
employment  is  advocated  from  tlie  fear  that  the  weapon 
may  grow  rusty  through  disuse  it  is  doomed.  The  British 
connexion,  though  )t  has  not  conciliated  the  affections  of 
Irishmen,  has  reconstructed  Iri>h  existence  and  nationality 
on  a  model  to  which  the  ancient  Irish  language  is  alien. 
Gaelic  does  not  express  modern  Irish  wants  and  ideas. 
They  are  expiessed  by  English.  A  population  may  be 
taught  to  speak  a  foreign  tongue,  as  Walloons  have  been 
taught  to  speak  French.  The  foreign  tongue  is  learnt  be- 
cause the  population  has  dealings  with  those  to  whom  it 
is  native,  and  for  its  own  convenience  wishes  to  be  under- 
stood. Had  Irishmen  continued  to  .speak  Irish,  a  majority 
of  them  would  have  learnt  English  also,  as  a  majority  of 
Welshmen  learn  English  and  of  Bietons  French.  \Vere 
Irishmen  now  to  learn  Irish,  it  could  be  for  communication 
solely  among  themselves,  and  communication  of  what  ? 
Had  there  been  purely  Irish  thoughts  for  which  Irish  was 
the  sole  vehicle,  the  language  would  never  have  become 
obsolete.  As  it  is,  the  resumed  use  of  Irish  would  be 
simply  for  the  translation  of  thoughts  from  the  Enghsh  in 
which  they  are  born  into  a  di.alect  as  foreign  to  Irishmen, 
notwithstanding  its  name  and  history,  as  English  was  to 
the  men  of  Connaught  in  the  days  ol  Queen  Elizabeth. 

In  deprecating  the  artificial  cultivation  of  Irish  as  the 
national  language,  we  are  actuated  by  no  dread  or  jealousy 
of  its  power  to  raise  up  fresh  obstacles  to  political  amal- 
gamation. Irishmen,  as  we  have  had  occasion  at  other 
times  to  observe,  inclosed  within  the  prison  of  a  tongue 
unintelligible  outside,  would  have  much  less  strength  to 
agitate  against  the  British  connexion  than  when,  as  now. 
the  agitators  discourse  in  phrases  half  the  world  can  inter- 
pret. Irish  partnership  in  the  English  language  has  sup- 
plied Nationalists  and  Home  Rulers  and  Land  Leaguers 
and  Fenians  with  nine-tenths  of  their  political  leverage. 
The  English  objection  to  the  scheme  of  the  Union  for  the 
preservation  of  the  Irish  language  is  not  so  much  that  it 
ought  not  to  succeed  as  that  it  will  not  succeed.  To 
lavish  ardour  in  bribing  teachers  and  school  children 
to  learn  a  language  which  can  teach  them  nothing, 
and  by  which  they  can  teach  nothing,  is  like  endowing 
a  day  labourer  with  a  machine  to  test  gold.  Irish- 
men are  shrewd  enough  not  to  be  tempted  in  large 
numbers  to  an  unremunerative  outlay  of  brain  power. 
But  the  predetermined  futility  of  the  enterprise  will  not 
the  less  induce  a  sense  of  disappointment  and  vexation. 
Many  creatures,  vegetable  and  animal,  are  most  interest- 
ing as  specimens  whi^h  are  neither  desirable  nor  possible 
subjects  of  cultivation.  A  language  which  has  lost  its 
hold  on  contemporary  cirilization  resembles  them .  Living 
languages  are  susceptible  of  development  and  refinement. 
In  order  to  live  tliey  must  contain  in  themselves  the  power 
of  assimilating  nutriment.  The  power  cannot  be  engrafted 
upon  them  if  they  have  lost  it.  Irrefutable  facts  lead  to 
the  conclusion  that  Irish  has  suffered  this  fate.  It  is  a 
pity  that  admirers  of  its  very  real  antiquarian  riches  should 
waste  on  tlie  vain  effort  to  force  back  on  their  country- 
men a  piece  of  furniture  they  had  already  turned  out  of 
doors,  labour  which  might  be  fruitfully  spent  in  fittmg  it 
for  safe  and  honourable  deposit  among  the  treasures  of 
the  national  museum.

Jersey, 


For  ihe  preservation  and  cultivation  of  the  Irish  lan- 
guage, was  established  some  years  since,  to  encourage 
the  preservation  of  this  great  branch  of  the  Celtic  language, 
the  Gwycklelian  or  Gaelic,  and  to  which  belong;  also  the 
Irish  and  Manx,  or  that  spoken  in  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  in 
Brittany.  We  have  on  our  librarj'  table  the  rules  of  this 
patriotic  association,  forwarded  by  the  Honorary  Secre- 
taiy,  the  Rev.  John  Nolan,  O.D.C.,  to  whom  we  offer  our 
hearty  thanks  and  best  wishes  for  the  success  of  this 
laudable  undertaking.  Ireland  is  very  dear  to  us,  and  it 
will  ever  be. 

The  Gaelic  Union  Association  are  preparing  to  issue  a 
Journal,  which  will  appear  monthly,  partly  English,  partly 
Irish,  which  will  be  entirely  devoted  to  the  one  object — 
the  furtherance  of  the  Gaelic  movement. 

At  an  early  day  we  will  revert  to  this  interesting  ques- 
tion, giving  full  particulars  to  our  readers.

REPORT    OF    THE    COMMITTEE. 

To  THE  Council  of  the  Gaelic  Union. 

Gentlkmen, — Your  Provisional  Committee  appointed 
at  the  meeting  of  llie  Council,  held  on  Wednesday,  the 
iSth  instant,  beg  to  submit  their  Report  as  follows  : — 

In  accordance  with  the  instructions  which  they  received, 
your  Committee  duly  made  the  necessary  arrangements  to 
invite  from  the  various  prin'ing  establisliments  (in  a  posi- 
tion to  do  so)  estimates  for  Printing  the  Garlic  Union 
yournal.  Tlie  Members  met  at  No.  4  Gardiner's-place, 
at  eight  o'clock,  p.m.,  on  the  24th  instant,  for  the  trans- 
action of  business  :  present,  Messrs.  Cusack,  Comyn,  and 
Morrin.  Rev.  Father  Nolan,  O.D.C.,  was  also  present, 
and  gave  us  the  benefit  of  his  sound  advice  and  experience. 

Ha\*ing  compared  and  carefully  considered  the  several 
estimates  submitted,  your  Committee  unanimously  decided 
to  recommend  to  the  Council  that  the  estimate  of  Mr. 
Dollard,  Dame-street,  be  adopted. 

The  question  of  the  supply  of  paper  for  the  Gaelic  Union 
Journal  having  also  come  up  in  connection  with  the  esti- 
mates, your  Committee  decided  upon  strongly  recommend- 
ing to  the  Council  that  home  manufactured  paper  be  used 
in  preference  to  pnper  not  made  in  Ireland  ;  and  to  further 
recommend  that  the  firm  of  Messrs.  Browne  and  Nolan, 
Nassau  street,  be  asked  to  supply  the  paper  for  printing 
the  journal,  provided  that  they  can  supply  such  home- 
made paper  upon  equal  terms  with  any  English  or  Scotch 
firm  both  as  regards  quality  and  price. 

Lastly,  your  Committee  decided  to  recommend  to  the 
Council  the  ad\isability  of  having  the  new  journal  pub- 
lished by  the  Gaelic  Union  itself.

P.P.,  Modeligo,  Cappoquin,  contributed  £\,

nal, the  meeting  adjourned  to  the  8th

His  Grace  the  Archbishop  of  Cashel, 
Patron  of  the  Gaelic  Union,  has  addressed 
to  Rev.  John  E.  Nolan,  O.D.C.,  Hon.  Sec, 
the  following  letter  in  reference  to  this 
journal  : — 

"  The  Palace, 

"Thurles,  19th  Oct.,  1882. 

"  My  dear  Father  Nolan, — I  wish  to  be- 
come a  subscriber  to  the  Gaelic  Union 
Journal,  which  I  am  glad  to  learn  is  soon  to 
make  its  appearance  amongst  us.  I  trust, 
and  indeed,  I  feel  assured,  that  it  will  be  a 
great  success.  May  I  take  the  liberty  of 
suggesting  that  instead  of  the  Gaelic  Union 
Journal  you  would  call  it  simply  the  Gaelic 
Journal.     The  reason  is  obvious. 

"  I  am,  my  dear  Father  Nolan,
