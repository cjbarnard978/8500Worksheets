TO  OUR  READERS. 

A  very  wide-spread  demand  on  the  part 
of  that  ever-increasing  section  of  the  public 
who  take  an  active  interest  in  the  Irish  lan- 
guage calls  continually  for  the  publication 
of  this  Journal  under  conditions  that  would 
bring  it  more  within  the  reach  of  the  many, 
and  make  it  more  popular  with  them. 
While  we  recognise  gratefully  this  evidence 
of  the  general  sense  of  the  good  work  the 
Gaelic  Journal  \\'as  done,  and  is  capable  of 
doing,  we  confess  that  the  prospect  of 
meeting  the  demand  causes  us  no  sinall 
anxiety.  As  the  only  way  possible  of 
realizing  this  prospect,  we  propose  making 
a  covenant  with  our  supporters.  The  terms 
we  suggest  are  as  follows  : — 

The  supporters  of  the  Journal,  by  per- 
sonal canvass  or  otherwise,  to  extend  the 
circulation  of  the  Journal  to  at  least  i,000 
copies. 

In  return  therefor,  the  Journal  to  be  pub- 
lished monthly,  with  certain  improvements 
which  will  tend  to  make  it  still  more  popu- 


lar, and  at  the  lowest  price  which  cost  of 
publication  will  allow. 

A  little  effort  on  the  part  of  our  present 
supporters  will  achieve  all  that  is  desired. 
Let  each  one  introduce  the  Journal  to  one 
or  two  others  who  do  not  at  present  read  it, 
and  the  thing  is  done.  Those  who  under- 
take to  extend  our  circulation  in  this  way, 
would  do  well  to  collect  personally  the  sub- 
scriptions of  their  friends,  and  to  forward 
them  in  the  usual  way,  with  the  names  and 
addresses  of  the  subscribers.  We  are  not 
at  present  in  a  position  to  make  any  reduc- 
tion in  the  subscription,  but  when  our  in- 
creased circulation  enables  such  a  reduction 
to  be  made,  we  shall  continue  to  send  the 
Journal  to  subscribers  at  the  reduced  rate 
until  their  subscriptions  are  exhausted. 

The  Journal  will  contain  the  following 
features,  new  and  old  : — 

1°.  A  complete  series  of  Lessons  in  Irish 
for  beginners.  These  lessons  will  be  pre- 
pared with  the  greatest  care,  so  as  to  make 
them  as  simple  and  as  generally  intelligible 
as  possible.  In  short,  they  will  form  a  full 
course  of  Irish  Self-Taught,  covering  gram- 
mar, composition,  idiom  and  pronunciation 
in  an  easily  graduated  system. 

2°.  A  series  of  Easy  Readings  in  Irish. 

3°.  Folk-lore  in  prose  and  verse.  The 
prose  specimens  will  present  to  the  student 
examples  of  the  Irish  language  in  common 
vernacular  use  from  all  the  Irish-speaking 
parts  of  Ireland. 

4°.  Studies  in  the  older  periods  of  Irish. 
The  student  who  wishes  to  understand  the 
structure  and  genius  of  the  Irish  language 
must  necessarily  fall  back  on  its  older  litera-

ture.  Those,  too,  who  would  become 
masters  of  the  living  idiom  will  do  well  to 
study  it  in  the  purity  of  its  early  days. 
They  will  thus  be  enabled  to  judge  with 
certainty  between  the  better  and  the  worse 
in  modern  usage.  They  will  also  under- 
stand better  the  great  and  varied  powers  of 
expression  with  which  our  language  is 
endowed. 

5°.  Notes  and  Queries  on  all  matters  of 
difficulty,  obscurity,  or  curious  interest  in 
connexion  with  the  Irish  language.  This 
department  will  enable  many  students  to 
settle  their  own  doubts  and  to  bring  in- 
formation to  others  on  the  many  knotty 
and  uncertain  points  that  necessarily  arise 
in  the  study  of  a  language  circumstanced 
like  ours.  It  will  also  place  on  permanent 
record  many  of  the  observations  of  the 
numerous  acute  scholars  whose  labours  have 
hitherto  been  as  writings  on  the  sand.  We 
cordially  invite  both  classes  to  make  the 
fittest  use  of  this  section  of  the  Journal. 

6°.  The  News  of  the  Month,  informing 
our  readers  of  the  most  important  things 
done,  written  and  spoken,  in  regard  of  Irish 
Literature  and  of  the  movement  to  maintain 
the  use  of  the  Irish  language,  and  also  of 
the  progress  of  kindred  movements  among 
our  brothers  of  Scotland,  our  cousins  of 
Wales,  and  other  peoples. 

7°.  Original  Contributions,  especially  in 
prose.  To  be  candid,  we  have  too  many 
poets.  It  should  be  remembered  that  only 
a  master  of  language  can  write  poetrj'. 
Prose  is  much  better  material  for  appren- 
tice work. 

8°.  Gaelic  Life  in  general,  past  and  pre- 
sent, history,  archaeology,  music,  arts, games, 
and  all  the  customs  of  our  race,  will  find 
occasional  space  within  our  columns. 

It  now  rests  with  our  readers  to  enable  us 
to  fulfil  all  that  we  hold  out.  It  is  acknow- 
ledged on  all  hands  that  the  Gaelic  Journal 
has  not  hitherto  been  unworthy  of  its  place 
as  the  representative  in  journalism  of  the 
cause  of  the  Old  Tongue  in  the  Old  Land. 
If  brighter  days  seem  now  to  be  in  store  for 
the  Old  Tongue,  the  decade's  work  done  by 
the  Journal  against  very  adverse  circum- 
stances has  had  no  small  part  in  bringing 
about  that  result.     The  issue  of  our  present 


proposals  will  be  an  excellent  test  of  the 
prospects  of  the  language  and  of  the  reality 
of  the  revival  in  the  movement  for  its  pre- 
servation. The  figure  mentioned  by  us  as 
a  minimum  ought  not  to  be  one-third  of  our 
normal  circulation  in  this  country.  We 
may  state  that  already  promises  of  widely- 
extended  support  are  reaching  us.  One 
reader  undertakes  to  get  twenty  new  sub- 
scribers in  one  locality.  Another  promises 
ten.  Another  has  brought  in  orders  from 
three.  There  are  few  of  our  readers  who 
are  not  in  a  position  to  do  equal  work  in 
the  cause  of  the  national  language.

Translation, 
our  native  language. 

There  is  no  nation  throughout  the  world  that  does  not 
think  it  honourable'  to  esteem  its  own  language,  and  to 
read  it  and  write  it.^  The  Romans  gave  so  much  esteem 
and  honour  to  the  Latin  language,' although  they  were 
well  le.Trned  in  the  Creek  language,  which  was  in  esteem' 
at  that  time — nevertheless'  they  did  not  think  it  fitting'' to 
answer  the  envoys  or  letters  of  the  Greeks  but  in  the  Latin 
language  ;  and  moreover,  after  the  Greeks  were' [brought] 
under  them  and  under  their  rule,  they  (the  Romans)  pre- 
tended^ that  they  did  not  understand  the  Greek  language, 
though  they  understood  it  very  well.  For  it  is  not  only 
in  Rome  that  this  [language]  was  [spoken],  but  through- 
out Asia  [Minor]  entirely,  and  also  over  the  whole  of 
Greece  ;  and  this  in  order  that  there  might  be  great 
respect  for  the  Latin  language.  Moreover,  to  verify  this, 
as  Dion  Cassius  has  writien,  the  Emperor  Claudius 
punished  very  severely'  a  Roman  senator  for  not  speaking 
Latin,'"  although  the  Emperor  delighted  in"  Greek 
verses,  sayings  and  proverbs. 

In  these  times,  hkewise,  the  ambassadors,"  i.e.,  the 
messengers  of  the  kings,  do  not  speak  their  business  but 
in  the  natural  language  of  their  own  king  ;  after  this" 
they  make  their  meaning  understood  through  an  inter- 
preter.'* Cicero  was  veiy  censorious'  towards  those  who 
took  pleasure  in's  the  Greek  language  and  in  other  foreign 
languages,  and  who  despised  their  own  natural  language 
(of)  Latin,  saying  : — "  I  cannot  help  wondering  very 
much'^  at  a  thing  so  extraordinary  that  it  is''  against  all 
reason,  i.e.,  that  every  one  should  not  esteem  hi»  own 
native  natural  language." 

For  this  reason,  it  is  right  and  fitting  for  us,  the  Irish,"' 
to  be  full  of  esteem,  love  and  honour  for  our  own  native 
natural  language,  tlie  Gaelic,  whicli"'  is  so  much  in  the 
background,  so  stamped  out,  that  it  has  almost  gone'"  out 
of  the  people's  memory  :  the  blame  of  this  maybe  laid  on 
the  learned,  who''  are  the  authors  of  the  language,"  who 
have  buried  it  under  obscurity  and  difficulty  of  vocabu- 
lary," writing  it  in  mysterious,  obscure  and  untelligible 
idioms  and  words  ;  and  many  of  our  gentry  arc  not  free 
[from  blame]  who  regard'^  their  native  natural  language, 
which  is  forcible,  leady.  digniiied,  cultured,  and  exact  in 
itself,  with  contempt  and  with  disregard,  and  who  spend 
their  time  labouring  and  learning  other  foreign"-'  tongues. 

■  Lit.  "  That  it  is  not  honourable  with  it  ;"  a  more 
classical  form  would  be  le  nAc  onópAc,  "with  whom  it 
is  not  honourable."  bheic  ceAiiAiiiAil  A»\,  lit.  "to  be 
esteemful  on."     See,  also,  third  paragraph,  line  two. 

■  Lit.  "And  its  reading  and  its  writing."  Note  that  a 
is  not  the  "  sign  "  of  the  infinitive,  as  some  modern  gram- 
marians state.  A  before  an  infinitive  can  only  mean 
"his,"  "her,"  "its,"  "their,"  as  peuciTAT)  be  ti-A 
■oetinAiii.  "  I  shall  look  to  its  doing,  I  shall  try  to  do  it." 
When  we  meet  such  phrases  as  luc  a  liiApbAW,  "to  kill 
a  mouse,"  the  a  is  merely  a  corruption  of -00.  The  same 
corruption  is  found  in  many  other  phrases,  as  'cÁ  peAur» 
A  ■Die  0|\in  for  ■DO  ẃíc,  "  there  is  a  pen  of  want  on  me  ;  I 
want  a  pen,"  'Oub  A  coT)bAi!>  for  "oub  t>o  co'dLatj,  "going 
to  sleep,"  A  feip  niAp  Aueiji  bpiAti  for  no  péi)\,  "  accord- 
ing to  what  B  says,"  t>ub  a  bAiLe  for  ■oub  ■oo  biile  or 
■oo'n  bAile,  "  going  home." 

3  LAicme,  "  of  Latin,"  pronounced  tAinne,  gen.  of 
LATOeAn. 

'  Note  the  use  of  the  adverb  50  ceAnAriiAit  after  the 
verb  ACÁim,  where  in  English  an  adjective  would  be  used.

5  The  wiiter  departs  here  from  the  construction  that  he 
had  in  his  mind  in  beginning  the  sentence. 

'  Lit.  "  It  was  not  worthy  with  them." 

'Lit.  "After  the  Greelis  to  be  under  them."  Note 
that  tiiat  the  words  ni  nJiveu^AC  are  in  the  genitive 
governed  by  z&\\  é\y,  not  in  the  accusative  before  the 
infin.  tjo  beiú.     This  is  the  usage  of  all  good  writers.  • 

*  Oo  leijTOif.  cuigTOif,  the  imperfect  or  habitual  past 
=  "  they  used  to  pretend,"  &c. 

9  Lit.  "  It  is  very  severely  that  the  Emperor  C. 
punished,"  &c.  When  a  word  is  to  be  emphasized,  hke 
]AO-5eui\  here,  it  is  commonly  brought  to  the  front  of  the 
sentence  with  i]-  before  it.  Compare  below,  "  it  is  very 
censorious  that  C.  was.'' 

'°  Lit.  "  Through  without  Latin  to  speak."  It  is  com- 
monly laid  down  that  all  prepositions  take  the  dative  case 
in  modern  Irish.  The  accusative,  however,  seems  to  be 
used  after  5*" — "  c^oc  jŵn  bitiiA  lll)^)■^e,  a  stone  without 
hands  on  it."      Three  Shafts. 

"  Lit.  they  "  pleased  [with]  the  emperor." 

"  The  nominative  here  does  not  precede  its  verb  in  the 
Irish.  It  can  never  do  so  but  in  the  case  of  a  relative 
pronoun.  wnibarATiuipi  is  the  suspended  noininathe 
(nominativus  pendens),  and  the  sentence  would  be  literally 

rendered   "  the  ambassadors — they  do  not 

speak." 

'3  "  This  "  is  often  used  in  English,  where  ^-in  =  "  that  " 
is  used  in  Irish. 

"  "  It  is  with  a  man  of  language  (cp.  note  9),  that  they 
give  to  its  underslanding  their  mind." 

'5  Lit.  "On  the  party  who  used  to  be  pleasureful 
on,"  &c. 

'*  Lit.  "  It  is  not  possible  with  me  without  its  being  in 
its  very  great  wonder  on  me." 

■'  Lit.  "As  is." 

"  The  correct  term  in  Iri-h  for  the  Irish  language  is 
All  Jhiewedbg,  ^enitive  nA  jliiewiLge  (  =  eil,5e), 
dative  t)o'n  jhAe'òiÌ^  (^eilj.)  The  forms  most  in  use 
are  in  Connaught,  Jae-óib^e  in  all  cases  ;  in  Munster, 
Jiewibij,  gen.  Jûeŵibje,  or  more  commonly  J^oLuing, 
or  5.10U1111,  gen.  J^o^uinge  or  jAobuine.  From  this 
corrupt  form  is  again  formed  jAobancoip  =  5*S'd'^- 
jeoi^v,  "a  speaker  of  Irish." 

■'  Hoc  as  a  relative  =  "  who  "  does  not  occur  once  in 
Cl\i  biop-gioice  t'\  bh<i\j-,  nor  is  ii  used  in  the  spoken 
language,  so  far  as  I  am  aware.  The  word  is  simply 
Tteoc,  old  dative  of  nee  =  neAc,  *' one,  anyone."  'i'lie 
successive  stages  by  which  it  attained  the  meaning  "  who  " 
are  easily  traced  ;  but  in  the  relative  sense  it  does  not 
seem  to  have  ever  been  anything  but  a  book-word,  and 
it  may  perhaps  be  regarded  now  as  obsolete. 

■"  Lit.  "So  obscure,  so  quenched,  that  it  is  not  much 
that  it  has  not  gone,"  &c. 

"  Lit.  "  The  reproach  of  this — it  is  possible  to  put  it 
on  the  folk  of  science  who  are  authors  to  the  tongue  ;" 
Ẃ  cu|\  zz  *'  its  putting." 

"Lit.  "Words."

into  disregard." 

^^  CoiiiAigceuc  =  coiii  -ôJAit)  -CAc,  face  to  face  ;  a 
country  facing  or  bordering  on  another,  being  regarded  as 
"  foreign."  CoitiicrgeAC  is  another  form  of  the  word,  or 
perhaps  a  different  word  with  the  same  meaning,  in  which 
the  root  is  CI5,  ceic,  "  a  house,"  the  idea  being  "  ne.vt 
door,"  "neighbouring,"  wliich  applied  to  a  country  of 
course  means  "foreign."  Another  word  for  "foreign" 
is  coi5C|\iceAc,  that  is,  "  coterminous, "  countries  having 
the  same  boundary  (c^moc)  being  "  foreign  "  to  each 
Other.    In  Middle  Irish,  coniAi^cec  means  "  a  neighbour." 


Every  word  of  the  last  paiagraph  of  this  extract, 
written  two  and  a-lialf  centuries  ago,  may  well  be  taken 
to  heart  at  the  present  day.

THE  GAELIC  PAPERS. 

The  /risA  Echo  for  October  and  Novemljer  contains 
further  instalments  of  Keating's  great  work,  with  trans- 
lation and  notes,  and  the  Elegy  of  MacCotter,  very  well 
brought  out.  We  have  received  the  Gad,  of  Brooklyn, 
for  January,  with  many  interesting  articles.  A  Bohemian 
journal,  Cas,  sent  to  us,  contains  an  article  on  the  Gaelic 
movement,  Gaelic Jctimal  and  the  Gaelic  societies.  Nearly 
all  the  Irish  newspapers  have  articles  on  Gaelic  subjects  ; 
and  the  Gaelic  columns  of  the  Tiiam  A'ews,  ll^ecily 
Freeman,  United  Ireland  and  Irish  American,  continue 
to  print  a  great  deal  of  Irish. 

In  Scottish  Gaelic  the  Cdtic  Monthly  h  becoming  more 
and  more  attractive.  The  price  is  threepence,  and  for 
this  the  reader  has  illustrated  articles  on  Highland  scenery, 
history,  customs,  &c.,  with  some  veiy  good  Gaebc. 
.Mac  f alia  is  the  only  weekly  Gaelic  paper  in  the  world, 
and  we  are  glad  to  see  that  the  proprietor  has  been  able 
to  enlarge  it  without  loss.  Its  closely-prinleil  columns 
are  a  treasure-house  of  colloquial  Gaelic,  and  special 
attention  is  being  given  to  Gaelic  proverbs.  In  the  issue 
of  December  9th,  Mr.  O'Leary's  sLuag  Sirie  is  translated 
into  Scottish  Gaelic.  The  American  Scotsman  has  a 
Gaelic  column.

of  Gaelic  Selections.  (Patrick  O'Brien,  46  Cuffe-street, 
Dublin;  price.  Three  Shillings.)  In  this  well  brought 
out  and  handsomely-bound  volume  of  about  200  pages, 
Mr.  O'Brien  has  gathered  together  many  typical  speci- 
mens of  popular  Irish  literature.  The  great  part  of  the 
book  is,  we  are  happy  to  say,  in  prose  ;  and  students  are 
now  given  an  opportunity  of  reading  for  themselves  some 
of  those  wonderful  romances  of  the  last  three  centuries, 
which  writers  on  Irish  literature  have  hitherto  almost 
neglected.  In  every  Irish  MS.  of  any  consequence, 
written  by  the  scribes  of  the  last  century,  the  e.icc|\<i 
ChoipoeoLbiig  line  Scaii«i  ajui"  a  cpnii]\  liiac  finds  a 
place.  The  tale  is  here  printed  in  full  for  the  first  time,

■ôeii\5,  another  old  favourite  of  the  scribes,  hitherto  un- 
published. A  vocabulary  is  added.  Two  "  Ossianic  ' 
Lays,  one  of  them  quite  modern,  are  given  towards  the 
close  of  the  book,  and  are  well  annotated.  It  is  to  be 
hoped  that  eTeryone  who  wishes  to  see  the  treasures  of 
our  manuscript  literature  made  accessible,  will  purchase 
this  publication  of  Mr.  O'Biien,  as  well  as  the  Si<imi-A  <\n

Dtiin  Iain  Ghohha,  vol.  i. — The  poems  of  John 
Morrisson,  edited  by  George  Henderson  (Sinclair, 
Glasgow).  This  is  a  volume  of  400  pages,  beautifully 
brought  out  at  the  Glasgow  Celtic  Press.  The  volume 
contains  a  memoir  of  Iain  Gobha  of  the  greatest  interest. 
The  poet  was  born  and  lived  in  the  remote  Island  of 
Lewis,  where  he  died  in  1S52.  His  vernacular  was 
Gaelic-English  he  learned  from  books,  and  his  Gaelic 
hymns  and  songs,  all  of  a  ''eeply  religious  character,  be- 
came highly  popular  in  mo.t  of  the  Gaelic-speaking  dis- 
tricts of  Scotland.  As  specimens  of  pi. re  Gaelic,  these 
compositions  are  of  the  grv;atest  pos-ible  value,  the  more 
so,  as  in  most  cases,  the  text  has  not  been  interfeied  with, 
and  represents  faithfully  the  spoken  language.  The  pre- 
sent volume  coixtains  over  a  dozen  of  his  longer  poems, 
and  another  volume  will  complete  the  work. 


THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


NOTES. 

Quite  a  number  of  respectable  farmers,  in  all  parts  of 
the  country,  liave  recently  been  prosecuted  on  the  ground 
of  not  having  their  names  inscribed  on  their  carts.  In 
reality  they  were  prosecuted  because  they  had  their  names 
printed  in  Irish  letters.  Now,  when  people  are  beginning 
tc  do  something  practical  for  the  language  and  literature, 
the  anti-Irish  Irishmen  are  trjing  to  do  all  they  can  to 
prevent  this. 


The  great  majority  of  the  Irish  readers  of  this  Journal 
hail  from  Munster,  and  the  most  of  them  from  Co.  Cork. 


A  recent  correspondent  says  : — "Where  there's  a  will 
there's  a  way.  I  was  56  years  of  age  before  I  ever  saw  a 
letter  of  Irish.  I  had  no  knowledge  of  the  language 
whatever.  I  commenced  at  the  alphabet,  and,  I  might 
say,  without  any  assistance  I  persevered,  so  that  I  can 
now  read  almost  any  modern  Irish."  The  writer  is  an 
Irish  workman  living  in  Chicago. 

We  often  hear  from  people  who  complain  that  it  is  im- 
possible to  procure  Irish  books  through  the  booksellers. 
Only  a  few  weeks  ago  one  of  the  chief  Dublin  booksellers 
wrote  that  he  knew  nothing  of  Coip  iu\  ceitieût),  or 
Siimpâ  All  jeniiiMti,  although  both  these  were  for  months 
advertised  in  Gill's  daily  list  of  books.  We  would  advise 
all  anxious  to  procure  second-hand  books  to  write  to  Mr. 
O'Brien,  46  Cuffe-street,  Dublin. 

Attention  is  invited  to  the  proverbs,  &c.,  given  above. 
Any  contributions  of  similar  character  will  be  gladly  re- 
ceived— .1  translation  should  alw.ays  be  sent. 


LATEST  GAELIC  NOTES. 

At  Galway,  on  Thursday,  25th  January,  the  Most  Rev. 
Dr.  M'Cormack  presided  at  a  great  meeting,  the  object  of 
which  was  to  found  a  branch  of  the  Gaelic  League.  Dr. 
Hyde,  Mr.  Cusack,  Mr.  Meehan,  and  Fr.  O'Urowney, 
attended  and  spoke.  Several  of  the  Galway  priests.  Father 
Dooley,  Father  Hayden,  S.J. ;  Father  Conway,  &c. ,  and 
influential  citizens,  also  addressed  the  meeting.  Irish 
classes  are  now  in  full  working  order,  a  library  of  Irish 
books  is  being  formed,  the  local  booksellers  have  promised 
to  procure  all  necessary  works,  and  the  local  press  has 
taken  up  the  cause  warmly.  It  is  the  intention  of  the 
League  to  send  speakers  to  any  Irish-speaking  district  in 
which  they  will  receive  a  welcome. 

Dr.  Hyde  recently  lectured  in  the  Irish  Literary  Society 
of  Dublin  on  the  characteristics  of  the  native  language 
and  literature.  Dr.  Sigerson  presided,  and  there  was  a 
large  audience. 

Within  the  past  few  months  several  lectures  have  been 
delivered  on  Irish  music.  Sir  R.  Stewart  in  Dublin,  and 
Mr.  Graves  in  London,  have  tried  to  e.yplain  the  secret  of 
the  beauty  of  the  old  Irish  music.  One  of  the  features  of 
the  Galway  meeting  of  the  Gaelic  League  was  the  pre- 
sence of  a  famous  Galway  piper,  who  played  the  maidrin 
rnaa/i,  and  many  other  pieces  of  similar  char.acter.  At 
the  same  meeting,  the  audience  had  an  opportunity  of 
witnessing  some  excellent  specimens  of  Irish  dancing. 


In  Glasgow,  on  30th  January,  Fr.  O'Growney  lectured  to 
the  Gaelic  Society  on  the  place  of  Scotland  in  the  ancient 
Gaelic  literature. 


Mr.  Veats  recently  delivered  in  London  a  very  interest- 
ing lecture  on  Folk-lore,  and  one  of  the  subsequent 
speakers  made  a  statement  which  has  created  quite  a 
commotion  in  Irish  circles.  It  is  that  some  of  the  descen- 
dants of  the  uuf  jrtunate  20,000  Irish  people  deported  by 
Cromwell  to  the  West  Indies  have  preserved  their  mother- 
tongue.  West  Indian  sailors  who  speak  Irish  are  now 
and  then  met  with  at  ihe  docks  of  London.  It  would  be 
of  the  greatest  interest  to  ascertain  what  is  the  precise 
form  of  the  language  they  speak,  and  whether  they  have 
adopted  the  same  changes  as  the  Gaels  of  Scotland,  who, 
about  the  same  time,  ceased  to  have  any  connection  with 
Ireland. 


The  Ct-llic  Monlhlij  for  February  is  a  distinct  advance 
on  its  predecessors.  ArticlesofScothish  history,  scenery, 
language  and  music  (and  its  relation  to  Irish  music),  and 
stories  of  national  life,  makeup  a  splendid  number. 

Our  next  issue  will  contain  some  Gaelic  from  the  Glens 
of  Antrim  ;  and  some  notes  on  an  Irish  translation  of 
Milton's  "  Paradise  Lost,"  made_by  a  native  of  Mitchels- 
town,  County  Cork. 


Our  Lessons  in  Irish. 

In  another  column  we  begin  a  series  of  simple  lessons, 
which  are  intended  not  only  to  teach  students  the  vocabu- 
lary of  Irish,  and  the  construction  and  idiom  of  the  lan- 
guage, but  also  to  give  some  idea  of  the  pronunciation.  The 
system  upon  which  the  lessons  are  constructed  is  ex- 
plained fully  in  the  lessons  themselves.  A  word  may  be 
said  here  as  to  the  circumstances  which  led  to  their  first 
publication  in  the  Weekly  Freeman,  fron>> which  they  are 
now  reprinted.  .Some  time  in  October  last,  the  Arch- 
bishop ol  Dublin  suggested  to  Father  O'Growney  that 
something  should  be  done,  if  possible,  to  assist  those  who 
are  anxious  to  study  the  native  language,  but  who  lose 
courage  when  they  find  that,  from  the  existing  elementary 
books,  they  can  learn  little  or  nothing  of  the  pronuncia- 
tion of  the  language.  The  Archbishop's  suggestion  was, 
that  after  eachlrish  word  should  be  given  as  near  an  ap- 
proximation to  the  pronunciation  as  could  be  attained  by 
the  use  of  some  simple  phonetic  system.  A  few  days  later, 
Mr.  Maurice  Ilealy,  M.P.,  published  a  series  of  letters,  in 
which  he  went  so  far  as  to  say  that  the  tr.adiiional  spelling 
should  be  abolished,  and  a.  purely  phonetic  or  hography 
introduced.  Father  O'Leary,  P.P.,  of  Castlelyons,  wrote 
to  the  very  opposite  effect,  contending  that  it  was  impossi- 
ble to  represent  phonetically  the  sound  of  the  language. 
This  contention  we  shall  examine  at  some  other  time. 

The  moment  seemed  favourable  for  giving  some  help  to 
those  thousands  of  Irish  people  who  are  only  too 
anxious  to  know  something  of  their  mother-tongue,  but 
who  do  not  know  how  to  set  .about  acquiring  it. 

It  was  proposed  to  the  iVicily  Freeman  that  a  course  of 
easy  lessons,  based  principally  ou  the  lines  suggested  by 
Dr.  Walsh,  should  be  published  from  week  to  week. 
The  Editor  of  the  H'eeify  Frenna»  welcomed  the  pro- 
posal cordially,  and  the  lessons  were  forthwith  begun,  and 
were  warmly  received. 

The  lessons  are  now  reprinted,  so  that  they  may,  be- 
fore appearing  in  book  form,  have  the  benefit  of  the  sug- 
gestions and  criticism  of  our  readers.  Other  simple  lessons

in  the  idiom  and  grammar  of  the  language  will  follow,  and 
easy  texts,  such  as  that  given  in  another  part  of  this  number, 
will  be  prepared.  Suggestions  upon  the  lessons,  and  con- 
tributions towards  the  publication  of  the  books,  may  be 
sent  to  Father  O'Growney,  Maynooth,  Ireland.  The 
Archbishop  of  Dublin  has  already  promised  a  contribution 
of  ^10,  and  Mr.  J.  J.  Murphy,  Coik,  the  same  sum. 


EASY  LESSONS  IN  MODERN 
IRISH. 

THE  IRISH  ALPHABET. 

§  I.  In  commencing  to  study  any  language  from  books, 
we  must  first  learn  the  alphabet — the  characters  in  which 
the  language  is  written  and  printed.  A  glance  at  an  Irish 
manuscript  or  printed  book  will  at  once  tell  us  tliat  the 
letters  used  in  writing  and  printing  Irish  are  somewhat 
different  from  those  we  use  in  English.  Tliey  are  also 
fewer  in  number.  We  give  the  characters  of  the  Irish 
alphabet,  both  capitals  and  small  letters,  with  the  English 
letters  to  which  they  correspond  : —

11  u  u 

§  2.  These  eighteen  letters  are  the  only  characters 
needed  in  writing  Irish  words.  It  will  be  noticed  that 
the  Irish  "c"  corresponds  to  the  English  "  k,"  as  it  is 
never  soft  as  c  is  in  the  word  "  cell,"  but  always  hard  as 
in  "  iold,"  or  like  k  in  ";iill."  Similarly,  5  is  never  soft, 
as  g  in  ^em,  ^aol ;  but  hard,  as  in  ra»,  ^et,  gaẃ. 

§  3.  It  will  also  be  noticed  that  these  letters  differ  but 
little  from  the  ordinary  Roman  letters  which  we  use  in 
printing  or  writing  English.  The  Irish  forms  of  the 
letters  t),  j;,  c,  are  often  used  in  ornamental  English 
lettering.  The  only  letters  which  present  any  difficulty  .ire 
the  small  letters  •(.,  r,  and  p,  s  ;  the  student  who  can  dis- 
tinguish these  from  each  other  has  mastered  the  Irish 


alphabet.  This  so-called  "  Irish  Alphabet  "  is  not  of  Irish 
origin  ;  it  was  taught  to  the  Irish  by  the  early  Christian 
missionaries  who  came  from  the  Continent  in  the  fifth  and 
sixth  centuries  of  the  Christian  era.  The  letters  are  thus 
of  the  same  form  as  the  letters  then  used  on  the  Continent 
for  writing  Latin  and  Greek. 

§  4.  The  forms  of  the  Irish  letters  used  in  writing  do 
not  differ  from  those  used  in  printing.  Irish  copy-books 
can  be  procured  of  the  Dublin  booksellers. 

VOWELS    AND    CONSONANTS. 

§  5.  The  letters  are  divided,  as  in  other 
languages,  into  vowels  and  consonants. 
The  vowels  are  ẃ,  e,  1,  o,  u.  The  other 
letters  are  consonants. 

THE   VOWELS. 

§  6.  Each  vowel  has  two  sounds — a 
SHORT  sound  and  a  LONG  sound.  When  a 
vowel  is  to  be  pronounced  with  a  LONG 
sound  it  has  a  mark  over  it  as,  A,  é,  1,  ó,  t'l. 
When  there  is  no  mark,  the  vowel  has  a 
SHORT  sound. 

§  7.  Vowels  are  also  divided  into  two 
classes — the  BROAD  vowels,  <.\,  o,  u  ;  and  the 
SLENDER  vowels,  e,i.  This  is  an  important 
division.  The  student  is  not  to  confound 
BROAD  and  LONG  vowels  ;  any  of  the  three 
broad  vowels  may  be  either  long  or  short  ; 
they  are  long  when  marked,  as  <.\,  ó,  11  ; 
they  are  short  when  unmarked,  as  a,  o,  u. 
In  the  same  way,  the  slender  vowels  may 
be  long,  é,  i  ;  or  short,  e,  1. 

THE  CONSONANTS. 
§  8.  A  consonant  is  said  to  be  broad 
when  the  vowel  next  it,  in  the  same  word,  is 
BROAD  ;  and  SLENDER  when  the  vowel  next 
it  is  slender.  Thus,  \  in  \o\y^,  Af,  iiitA]-,  is 
BROAD  ;  X  in  p,  p>-\it,  imi'e,  is  slender. 

§  9.  Consonants,  in  addition  to  their  ordinary  natural 
sounds,  have,  in  modern  Irish,  softened  sounds.  These 
will  be  treated  in  a  special  chapter. 

PRONUNCIATION   OF   IRISH. 

§  10.  Although  it  is  true  that  no  one  can 
learn,  from  books  alone,  the  perfect  pro- 
nunciation of  any  language  like  Irish,  still 
it  is  possible  to  give  a  very  fair  approxi- 
mation to  every  sound  in  the  language 
except,  perhaps,  two.  Of  these  two,  one  is 
not  essential. 

The  plan  of  these  lessons  is  the  follow- 
ing : — We  give  in  each  exercise  a  number  of 
simple  sentences  in   Irish  to  be  translated 


252 


THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


into  English,  and  other  short  sentences  in 
English  to  be  translated  into  Irish.  At  the 
head  of  these  exercises  are  given  the  words 
which  the  student  must  know.  After  each 
word  we  give  two  things,  its  pronunciation 
and  its  meaning.  Thus,  the  entry,  "  yiX 
(saul),  a  heel,"  will  convey  to  the  student 
that  the  Irish  word  y6.i  is  pronounced 
"  saul,"  and  means  a  "  heel." 

§  II.  We  maj'  call  these  words  in 
brackets  KEY-WORDS,  as  they  give  a  key  to 
the  pronunciation. 

It  is,  of  course,  absolutely  necessary  that 
we  should  know  what  is  the  sound  of  each 
letter,  and  the  combination  of  letters,  in  the 
key- words. 

§  12.  Sounds  are  divided  into  vowel 
sounds  and  consonant  sounds. 

THE  VOWEL   SOUNDS. 
The  vowel    sounds  of  the  English  lan- 
guage   are    tabulated    as    follows    by    Mr. 
Pitman,  the  great  authority  on  phonetics  : — 

I.— THE   SIX   LONG   VOWEL-SOUNDS. 

1.  The  vowel-sound  in  the  word  /la//; 

2.  do.  do.  do.  ýay ; 

3.  do.  do.  do.  lie ; 

4.  do.  do.  do.  thought ; 

5.  do.  do.  do.  so ; 

6.  do.  do.  do.  poor. 

IL — THE   SIX   SHORT   VOWEL-SOUNDS. 

7.  The  vowel-sound  in  the  word  i/iat  ; 

8.  do.  do.  do.      bell ; 

9.  do.  do.  do.      is; 
ID.          do.              do.              do.       not; 

11.  do.  do.  do.      much; 

12.  do.  do.  do.     good. 
The   six    long   vowel-sounds,   then,   are 

brought  to  mind  when  we  repeat  the 
words : — 

"  Half-pay  he  thought  so  poor." 

Similarly,  the  six  short  vowel-sounds  are 
brought  to  mind  when  we  repeat  the 
words  : — 

"  That  bell  is  not  much  good." 

These  are  the  vowel-sounds  of  all  lan- 
guages, and  in  our  key-words  the  following 
symbols  shall  be  used  to  represent  those 
sounds : —

It  is  useful  to  note  that  the  sound  (No.  6)  o{  00  ]n  faor 
is  tlie  same  as  the  sound  oi  11  in  rule :  while  the  sound 
(No.  II)  of  II  in  iiý,  us,  is  the  s.inie  as  that  of  0  in  son, 
done.  It  will  be  noticed  that  the  same  numbers  are 
attached  to  the  same  sounds  in  both  tables. 

§14.    II.— THE  OBSCURE  VOWEL-SOUND.      THE  SYMBOLS 
ä  and  e. 

There  is  in  Irish,  as  in  English,  a  vowel-sound  usually 
termed  "obscure."  In  the  word  "  toleriible  "  the  a  is 
pronounced  so  indistinctly  that  from  the  mere  pronuncia- 
tion one  could  not  tell  what  is  the  vowel  in  the  syllable. 
The  symbols  ;1  and  ë  will  be  used  to  denote  this  obscure 
vowel-sound.  The  use  of  two  symbols  for  the  obscure 
vowel-sound  will  be  found  to  have  advantages.  The 
student  should,  therefore,  remember  that  the  symbols  ä 
and  ë  represent  one  obscure  vowel-sound,  and  are  not  to 
be  sounded  as  "a"  and  "  e  "  in  the  table  of  vowels  above. 
Thus,  when  the  Irish  for  "a  well,"  cobap  is  said  to  be 
pronounced  "  thúbár."  the  last  syllable  is  not  to  be  pro- 
nounced "  ar,"  but  the  word  is  to  be  sounded  as  any  of 
the  words,  "  thubbar,  thubber,  thubbor,  thubbur,"  would 
be  in  English.

Note. — Final  short  vowels  are  never  silent;  thus,ninie, 
mile  are  pronounced  min'-ë,  nieel'-e.     From  the  above 


table  it  will  be  seen  that  &  is  never  like  a  in/att,  e  like  e 
in  we,  1  like  i  in  mine,  o  like  0  in  not,  or  u  lilic  k  in  mule. 
The  short  vowels,  as  will  be  seen,  are  sometimes  modified 
by  the  following  consonant.  The  Munster  sounds  of  the 
short  vowels  are  treated  separately  below. 
§    18.    CONSONANTS. 

b,  y,  til,  p  are  sounded  like  b,  f,  m,  p  in  §  16.

5,  b,  11,  \\,  \,  often  like  g,  1,  n,  r,  s, 

§  19.  The  Article  and  the  Noun. 
There  is  no  indefinite  article  in  Irish  ; 
thus  5oi\c  means  "a  field."  The  DEFINITE" 
article  is  <.\n  "the;"  as,  ẃti  50)\c,  tót' field. 
In  such  phrases  (compare  the  English  "  a 
field  "),  the  stress  is  laid  on  the  noun  ;  there 
is  no  stress  on  the  aiticle,  and  the  vowel- 
sound  of  the  article  is  obscure,  as  ŵn  gone 
(an  gtirth).  In  the  spoken  language  the  n 
of  the  article  o^n  is  often  omitted  before 
nouns  beginning  with  a  consonant. 

§  20.  The  Adjective  and  the  Noun. 
All  adjectives,  except  a  few,  are  placed 
AFTER  the  noun  which  they  qualify  ;  as, 
1111  i\\\,  fresh  butter  ;  c\n  go^c  iiió|\,  the  big 
field  ;  50]ic  iiió]i,  Á)i-o,  a  big  high  field.

§  22.  Accents.  In  words  of  two  sylla- 
bles the  accent  is  upon  the  first  syllable,  as 
marked  in  oon'-a,  og'-as.  The  vowel  of  the 
last  syllable,  when  short,  is  then,  as  a  rule, 
obscure  (see  §  14,  above).

EXERCISE  11. 

§  25.  The  verb  To  BE.  The  English 
"  am,"  "  art,"  "  is,"  "  are,"  are  all  translated 
by  the  Irish  word  AcÁ(ä-thau').  This  word 
has,  it  will  be  noted,  the  accent  on  the  last 
syllable,  and  is  almost  the  same  in  sound 
as  the  English  words  "a  thaw."  In  THE 
SPOKEN  LANGUAGE  IT  IS  SHORTENED  TO 
'cÁ  (thau). 

§  26.  Verb  and  Nominative.  In  Irish 
.the  nominative  case  is  placed  immediately 
after  the  verb  ;  as,  acá  cú,  thou  art. 

§  27.  Verb,  Nominative  Case,  and 
Adjective.  In  English  sentences  like 
'■  the  field  is  large,"  the  order  of  words  is— 
I,  nominative  case;  2,  verb;  3,  adjective. 
In  translating  such  sentences  into  Irish,  the 
words  must  be  placed  in  the  following 
order — i,  verb  ;  2,  nominative  case  ;  3,  ad- 
jective.    Examples: —

When  there  is  another  adjective 
qualifying  the  nominative  case,  it  is  placed 
immediately  after  its  noun,  as  : —

r  r  run 

r  (no  sound  exactly  similar 

in  English  :  see  note), 
s  s  so,  alas

Note. — The  sound  of  "  r  "  is  never  slurred  over  as  in 
the  words  "firm,  warm,  farm,"  etc.,  as  correctly  pro- 
nounced in  English.  The  sign  "r'"  represents  the  "  r" 
with  rolling  sound  heard  in  the  Ijeginning  of  English  woi  ds; 
as  run,  rage,  row,  etc.  The  sign  ''  r  "  represents  a  peculiar 
Irish  sound,  midway  between  the  "  rr ''  of  "  carry  "  and  the 
"  zz  "  of  "  fizz."  The  learner  may  pronounce  it  as  an 
ordinary  English  "r"  until  he  has  learned  the  exact 
sound  from  a  speaker  of  Iiish.  Note  that  "  s  "  is  never 
pronounced  "z,"  or  "zh,"  as  in  the  English  words 
"  was,"  "  occasion,"  etc.

EXERCISE    V. 

§  44.    SOUNDS   OF  i  AND   n. 

In  Irish  there  are  three  sounds  of  I  and 
three  sounds  of  n. 

§  45.  I.  As  already  stated,  t  and  n  are 
often  pronounced  as  in  English  words,  e.g., 
as  in  look,  lamb,  noon. 

§  46.  2.  There  arc  also  what  they  call 
the  thick  sounds  of  L  and  n.  If  the  upper 
part  of  the  tongue  be  pressed  against  the 
roof  of  the  mouth  while  the  English  word, 
"  law,"  is  being  pronounced,  a  thick  sound 
of"!"  will  be  heard.  This  s^jund  does  not 
exist  in  English.  In  the  key-words  we 
shall  represent  this  sound  by  the  symbol 
L  (capital). 

Similarly,  if  the  tongue  be  pressed  against 
the  roof  of  the  mouth  while  the  word 
"  noon  "  is  being  pronounced,  a  thick  sound 
of  "  n  "  will  be  heard.  This  sound  does 
not  exist  in  English,  and  in  the  key-words 
it  will  be  represented  by  N  (capital). 

§  47.  3.  The  third  sound  of  b  is  that 
given  in  English  to  the  L  in  Luke,  the  /  in 
valiant,  or  to  the  //  in  IViI/iaui,  million,  as 
these  words  are  usually  pronounced.  We 
shall  represent  this  sound  by  italic  /.  In 
the  same  way,  n  has  a  third  sound  like  that 
given  in  English  to  n  in  neiv,  Neivry,  and 
we  shall  use  n,  italic,  as  a  symbol  for  this 
sound.* 

§  48.  We  can  now  add  to  our  table  of 
consonant  sounds  the  following  : —

Taliant,  &c.,  &c.,  are  pronounced  exactly  the  same  as  the 
/  in  law,  or  in  alL 

It  is  the  Hi  or  li,  preceding  a  vowel,  that  gets  the 
special  sound.     So,  too,  with  the  n  in  OHÌon,  Newry,  &c.

THE    GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


§  49.   In  many  parts  of  Ireland 

\.  broad  is  a/ways  sounded  like  our  symbol  L 
I  slender  „  ,,  „  / 

n  broad  „  „  „        N 

n  slender  ,,  .,  „         ?i 

We  recommend  to  private  students  this 
simple  method  of  pronunciation  in  pre- 
ference to  the  following  more  elaborate 
rule,  which  is  followed  in  Connaught  Irish. 

§  50.  {A).  Between  vowels,  single  t  and  11  are  pro- 
nounced as  ill  English  ;  as  máloi  (niaiil'-ä),  a  bag  ;  iiiibf 
(mil'-ish),  sweet;  I'liiA  (oo'-nä),  Una;  niinic  (min'-ik), 
often.  At  tlie  end  of  words,  sin^jle  i  and  n,  preceded  by 
a  vowel,  are  also  pronounced  as  in  English  ;  as,  bin 
(baun),  white-haired  ;  ax&í  (os'-ftl),  an  ass.  Siugle  band 
11,  when  next  any  of  the  gutturals,  5,  c,  or  the  l.ibi.ils,  b, 
f,  p,  are  like  English  1,  n  ;  as,  olc  (iilk),  b:id  ;  blAj- 
(bios),  taste. 

(B).  In  the  beginning  of  words, 

b  broad  is  froitouHcea  L 

t  slender  ,,  / 

11  broad  ,,  N 

n  slen*ier  ,,  n 

(C).   lb  bro.rd  is  ahaays  pionoiinced  I, 

lb  slender  „  „  / 

mi  broad  ,,  ,,  N 

nn  slender  ,,  ,,  « 

(U).  When  next  n,  ■(,,  c,  b,  111,  ti,  \  (the  consonants  in 
"  don't  hi  mit  st'\r"),  b  and  ti,  if  broad,  are  pronounced 
I-,  N  ;   if  slender,  /,  >i. 

§  51.  The  student  should  not  be  dis- 
couraged by  the  rich  variety  of  sounds  for 
two  characters.  It  may  be  borne  in  mind  (i) 
that  words  involving  these  letters  will  be  per- 
fectly understood,  even  if  each  t  and  11  is  pro- 
nounced with  the  ordinary  PInglish  sound  ; 
(2)  that  in  many  districts  the  people  have 
simplified  the  pronunciation,  as  noted  above 
in  §  49  ;  and  (3)  that,  by  a  careful  reference 
to  our  table  of  sounds,  the  student  will  soon 
learn  by  practice  the  sound  to  be  given  to 

I  and  n  in  each  particular  case.  We  give, 
for  practice,  some  words  for  pronuncia- 
tion. 

L  sounds.    i<3>5  (Log),  I05  (Lug),  ]"Iac 
(sLoth),  -oLijn  (dliLoon),  cltj  (ihLoo). 
/sounds,    till  (/een),  i-li:n  (sh/ccm),  yille

N    sounds,     till]-   (N'oos),    fn^g    (sNog),

THE    GAELIC  JOURNAL. 
Vol.  v..  No.  i. 

Price  6d.  a  copy,  post  free  ;  Annual  Subscription,  6s. 


With  this  number  we  commence  a  new 
series  of  the  Gaelic  [ountal,  which  we  hope 
to  issue  monthly  for  the  future.  The  sale 
of  the  whole  impression  of  No.  48  has  en- 
couraged us  to  think  that  a  monthly  issue 
of  the  Journal  will  find  a  sufficient  number 
of  subscribers  to  pay  for  printing  and  pub- 
Hshing.  Our  subscribers  at  present  are  of 
various  classes — (i)  those  who  have  paid  in 
advance  for  the  twelve  monthly  numbers  ; 
(2)  those  who  pay  in  advance  for  any  time 
they  wish  ;  (3)  those  who  pay  sixpence  in 
advance  for  the  next  number  only  ;  (4) 
those  who  endeavour  to  extend  the  circu- 
lation of  the  Journal  by  taking  a  number  of 
copies  of  each  issue,  returning,  after  a  time, 
the  unsold  copies  and  the  price  of  those 
disposed  of. 

We  respectfully  invite  friends  of  the  Irish 
language  to  assist  the  Journal  in  any  of 
those  ways.  All  communications  to  be 
addressed  to  the  Editor. 

We  have  to  thank  the  Irish  Press  for 
their  notices  of  our  last  number,  which  were 
the  means  of  making  the  existence  of  the 
Journal  known  to  many.  We  have  also  to 
thank  cordially  many  gentlemen  who  ob- 
tained subscriptions  from  their  friends. 
Some  gentlemen  sold  loo  copies  ;  others, 
30,  20,  12,  6,  &c.,  &c. 


Our  Easy  Lessons  have  been  received 
with  much  favour,  and  many  correspon- 
dents have  kindly  sent  suggestions.  It  i.s, 
in  a  way,  to  be  regretted  that  so  much  of 
the  Journal  is  taken  up  with  matter  so 
elementary,  but  a  good  foundation  for  Irish 
studies  is  the  first  requisite.  Besides,  nine- 
tenths  of  our  subscribers  are  beginners. 


Matter  inteiided  to  be  printed  should  be  written  care- 
fully and  legibly.  Preference  will  be  given  to  simple 
Irish  prose,  modelled  on  the  spoken  language. 


All  the  back  numbers  of  the  Gaclii  Journal  can  be  had 
except  No.  4.  Price,  post  free,  6d.  each.  There  are  only 
a  few  copies  of  No.  48.  The  table  of  contents  of  Vol.  IV., 
with  photograph  of  Dr.  O'Donovan,  will  be  sent,  post 
free,  for  three  stamps.

Conn  yet.  Conn  is  young.  The  door  on 
the  fort  is  closed.  The  boat  is  clean.  The

yet.  Praise  the  country — do  not  leave  the 
country. 

EXERCISE  VII. 

§  59.  As  we  have  seen,  the  Irish  word 
corresponding  to  am,  art,  in,  are,  is  acá. 
The  negative  form,  corresponding  to  am 
not,  art  not,  is  not,  are  not,  is  nil  (//eel). 
Examples :  nil  me  cinn,  I  am  not  sick  ;  nil 
cii  05,  you  are  not  young  ;  nil  ye,  nil  ]"i,  he 
is  not,  she  is  not.  Ilil  -A]ic  Agu]'  Conn  aj 
An  cobAii,  Art  and  Conn  are  not  at  the  well. 
This  word  nil  is  a  shorter  form  of  the 
phrase  111  ỳuil,  as  we  shall  see. 

§  60  In  sentences  like  acŵ  <\|ic  Aju-p 
Conn  05,  Art  and  Conn  rt?'^  young,  it  will 
be  noted  that,  as  in  English,  the  adjective 
does  not  take  any  special  form.  In  many 
other  languages,  the  adjective  would  be  in 
the  plural,  agreeing  with  the  two  subjects 
of  the  sentence.  So  in  the  sentence  acá  nA 
i:i-]\  (fi?-)  05,  the  men  are  young,  the  adjec- 
tive 05  does  not  take  any  new  form, 
although  the  subject  is  plural.  This  is  true 
only  of  adjectives  after  the  verb  "  to  be." 

61.  Another  use  of  the  preposition  aj, 
at.  The  English  phrases,  "  I  am  going,  I 
am  growing,"  etc.,  were  formerly  sometimes 
written  and  pronounced,  "I  am  a'  going,"etc. 
This  was  a  shorter  form  of  "  I  am  at  going.'' 
In  Irish,  aj,  at,  is  always  used  in  translating 
the  present  participle  ;  as,  acá  me  aj  tduI, 
I  am  going  ;  acá  Conn  Ag  |.-Á]',  Conn  is 
growing.

The  Sounds  of  the  Letters  C  and  5. 

We  think  it  better  to  defer  the  study  of 
these  sounds  until  we  have  spoken  of  com- 
binations of  vowels. 

exercise  VIII. 

§  65.  There  are  two  things  which  make 
the  spoken  language  of  Ulster  and  Munster 
different  from  that  of  the  west  of  Ireland. 
These  two  points  of  difference  are  (i)  the 
syllable  to  be  accented,  and  (2)  the  pronun- 
ciation of  the  vowels. 

§  66.  We  have  already  stated  in  §  22, 
that  in  words  of  two  syllables,  the  first 
syllable  is  the  one  to  be  accented,  and  many 
examples  have  been  given.  In  this  and 
the  following  lessons  we  shall,  until  further 
notice,  speak  only  of  words  of  two  sylla- 
bles. 

§  Ó7.  Looking  over  Irish  words,  we  shall 
find  they  can  be  divided  into  two  classes, 
simple  words,  and  words  formed  from 
simple  words  by  the  addition  of  a  termina- 
tion. For  instance,  Á\m,  high,  is  a  simple 
word  ;  ÁpüÁn  (aurdh'-aun),  a  height,  a  hitl, 
is  formed  Apt),  by  adding  the  termination 
-An. 

§  68.  Simple  words  are  accented  on  the 
same  syllable  in  every  part  of  Ireland  ; 
compound  words  are  not. 

§  69.  The  most  common  terminations  of 
compound  words  are  05  and  -in,  which  have 
a  diminutive  force  ;  and  -An,  which  in  some 
words  has  a  diminutive  force,  and  in  others 
has  a  different  meaning.  In  Munster  Irish, 
all  these  terminations,  and  many  others, 
are  accented.  In  Ulster,  on  the  contrary, 
the  tendency  is  not  only  to  accent  tiie  first 
syllable  as  in  Connaught,  but  also  to 
.  shorten  unduly  the  last  syllable.

foreign  accentuation,  as,  conoin  (kur-on')  a

EXERCISE  IX. 
We  now  come  to  the  pronunciation  of 
the  vowels. 

§  74.  In  Ulster  the  vowels  a  and  o  are 
sounded  peculiarly,  thus  : —

§  75.  Pronunciation  of  the  Vowels 
IN  Munster. 
In  Munster  the  vowels  in  words  of 
two  or  more  syllables  are  pronounced 
regularly  ;  as,  bAlÌA  (boL'-ä)  cApAll 
(kop'-aL),  line  (im'-ë),  of  butter.  It  is 
only  in  monosyllables  (and,  to  a  very 
slight  extent,  in  words  formed  from  these 
monosyllables)  that  any  irregularity  of  jiro- 
nunciation  occurs.  The  irregularity  con- 
sists in  the  fact,  that  in  monosyllables 
containing  a,  1,  o  short  before  II,  nn,  or 
before  ni,  the  vowel  is  lengthened  in  sound. 
§  'j6.  This  lengthening  of  vowels  is 
noticeable  from  Waterlord  (where  the 
lengthened  vowels  have  a  very  peculiar 
sound)  up  to  Galway,  where  the  lengthen- 
ing is  much  less  marked.  Curiously 
enough,  the  same  lengthening  is  to  be 
noticed  at  the  opposite  extreme  of  the 
Gaelic-speaking  district,  the  north  and 
north-west  of  Scotland. 

77.  In  all  districts  there  is  a  perceptible  lengthening 
of  vowel  sound  before  -IL,  -nti,  -^Np  at  the  end  of  mono- 
syllables. Thus,  the  vowel  sounds  in  mitl,  pnn,  copjv 
are  everywheie  longer  than  those  in  mil,  pn,  cop. 
Compare  the  vowel  sounds  in.  the  English  words — weld, 
welt ;  curd,  curt  ;  grand,  grant. 

78.  What  the  effect  of  the  Munster 
lengthening  of  vowel  sounds  is,  can  be 
seen  from  the  following  table.  We  do  not 
pretend  to  give  all  the  shades  of  pronun- 
ciation of  various  parts  of  Munster.

79.  In  the  phonetic  key  will  be  found  the  sounds  to  be 
given  to  "ou,"  and  "ei."  The  East  Munster  a-ou  is 
pronounced  rapidly.  Sometimes  the  sound  of  00  is  given 
in  Munster  to  o  ;  as  Ationn,  over  (in  Conn.  än-üN,  in 
Munst.  ân-ooN'). 

80.  \Ve  can  now  introduce  many  familiar  words 
nvolving  these  prolonged  vowel  sounds.    In  the  table

EXERCISE   XI. 

§90.    SOUNDS  OF   GROUPS  01?  VOWELS. 

In  Irish,  as  in  English,  vowels  are  grouped  together  in 
three  ways.  (l.)  In  the  word  niin,  the  ii  and  /  are  pro- 
nounced separately  ;  the  ii  being  pronounced  distinctly, 
and  the  ;'  somewhat  obscurely.  The  s.-inie  may  be  said  of 
the  e  and  a  in  the  word  r^a/.  (2.)  In  the  word  loiiiui, 
the  sounds  of  0  and  /1  melt  into  e;ich  other,  forming  what 
we  call  a  diphthong.  (3.)  In  the  word  mean,  the  fa 
represents  one  simple  vowel  sound,  like  that  of  e  in  m/:. 
But  as  this  one  vowel  sound  is  represented  in  writing  by 
two  letters,  these  two  letters,  ea,  are  called  a  digraph. 
Other  digraphs  are  a/ in  mai»,  on  in  //iroiis^'li,  ac  in  Gaelic, 
ao  in  gaol,  oa  in  goal,  etc.  We  shall  now  examine  the 
vowel-groups  in  Irish.

§  99.  The  sail  is  not  large.  Lift  up  the 
large  sail.  Leave  the  hammer  on  the  anvil. 
The  anvil  is  heavy  ;  the  hammer  is  not 
heavy.  Leave  the  anvil  on  the  floor.  A 
brier  is  growing  at  the  door.  The  brier  is 
long  (and)  crooked.     The  big  boat  is  going 


up  the  harbour.  A  ship,  a  boat,  a  sail,  a 
mast.  There  is  sweet  music  at  the  well. 
I  am  going  up  to  the  well.  The  barley  is 
green  yet.     The  barley  is  fresh  (and)  sweet. 

EXERCISE  XIII. 

§  100.    LONG   SOUND   OF   ui. 

Examples — pú  (few),  fiijl(shewl,  shool), 
\<A,  (ewl),  •Diún  (cZewr),  cuiL  (kewl).  At 
present  we  cannot  conveniently  introduce 
the  few  words  containing  u'l  into  the 
exercises. 

§  lOI.   SHORT  SOUND  OF  eO  AND  nl. 

In  addition  to  the  long  sounds,  eo  and 
lu  have  4  short  sound.  The  short  sound  of 
both  can  be  represented  by  Tyu).  There 
are  only  a  few  words  containing  this 
sound,  and  these  words  cannot  be  intro- 
duced at  present. 

§  102.  It  is  usual  now  to  write  eo  and  n:i 
without  any  mark  of  length  over  the  last 
vowels ;  it  is  to  be  understood  therefore 
that  eo  and  lu  always  represent  the  long 
sounds  given  above  in  §  95.

GAELIC  NOTES. 
The  best  news  of  the  past  month  is  the  establishment 
of  an  active  brancli  <jl  the  Gaelic  League  in  Derry.  Tlie 
members  meet  in  .St.  Columb"s  Hall,  and  the  classes  are 
conducted  by  Mr.  Neville,  who  has  quite  recently  re- 
ceived a  certificate  fur  teaching  Irish.  A  ladies'  class  is 
about  to  be  started.  The  Derry  branch  has  al^o  furthered 
tlie  circulation  of  the  GluUc  Joiirnal,  up  to  forty  copies 
having  been  taken  in  the  district.  We  need  hardly  ad<l, 
that  much  of  the  impetus  given  to  Irish  studies  in  Derry 
is  due  to  the  warm  support  and  encouragement  of  the 
Deny  Journal. 


The  National  Teachers  of  Donegal,  in  their  meeting  at 
Stranorlar  on  March  loth,  passed  a  resolution  pledging 
themselves  to  use  every  effort  towards  the  revival  and 
extension  of  the  study  of  Irish.  In  speaking  to  the  re>o- 
lution,  Jlr.  Dceny,  of  Carradoan,  said,  with  truth,  that  it 
is  not  the  fault  of  the  National  Teachers  that  Irish  is  not 
taught  in  schools.  Teachers  are  hampered  and  restricted 
in  their  manifold  duties  by  a  systejii  little  known  to  out- 
siders, and  all  their  efl'orts  will  not  amount  to  much,  if 
they  are  not  assisted  in  other  quarters,  from  which  they 
have  a  right  to  expect  encouragement  and  assistance. 
The  speaker  went  on  to  say  : — "  I  do  not  know  whether 
or  not  it  is  generally  known,  but,  nevertheless,  it  is  a  fact, 
that  in  a  college  which  sends  out  a  very  large  number  of 
trained  teachers  year  after  year,  there  is  not  a  Professor  of 
Irish,  nor  is  the  subject  taught.  I  refer  to  St.  Patrick's 
Training  College,  Druuicondra.  I  believe  the  same  re- 
mark, too,  applies  to  the  other  training  colleges.  I  do 
not  know  if  the  Marlhorcugh-siiect  Coliege  is  an  e.\cep- 
tion.  I  speak  from  experience  when  I  say  that  many 
teachers  are  anxious  whde  in  training  to  study  the  Irish 
language,  if  the  opportunity  weie  afforded.  I  knew 
teachers  at  training — first-class  candidates — who  would 
haveselected  Irish  in  preference  to  either  heat  or  electricity 
if  permitted  by  the  authorities  of  the  college  to  do  so  ;  and 
I  am  confident  that  manvdf  the  twoyenr^'  students  would 
also  present  themselves  for  certificates  if  the  subject  were 
taught.  But,  paiadoxicalas  it  may  appear,  though  there 
is  a  Professor  of  Latin  and  a  Professor  uf  French,  theie  is 
no  Professor  of  Irish,  unless  recently  appointed.  I  am 
still  speaking  of  St.  Patrick's  Training  College,  which 
was  the  one  I  attended,  but  I  believe  the  same  re- 
marks apply  equally  to  all  the  Dublin  training  colleges, 
with  the  exception,  perhaps,  of  the  Marlborough-street 
College.  I  am  aware  that  the  authorities  of  St.  Patrick's 
Training  College  have  recently  been  approached  with  a 
view  to  the  appointment  of  a  Professor  in  Irish,  but  with 
what  success  I  have  not  heard.  Why  there  should  beany 
hesitation  in  the  case  why  the  subject  was  not  taught  long 
ago  in  preference  to  either  Latin  or  French,  is  to  me  a 
mystery.  I  say  if  the  Irish  language  is  not  preserved, 
the  colleges  will  be  more  to  blame  than  the  teachers. 
(Hear,  hear.)  But  apart  altogether  from  the  training 
colleges,  the  teachers,  I  admit,  can  do  much  by  studying 
for  certificates.  Many  possess  certificates  already,  and 
their  number  is  yearly  increasing.  There  are  some  people 
who  seem  to  imagine,  however,  that  the  teachers  have 
only  to  acquire  certificates  in  order  to  commence  the 
teaching  of  the  subject  at  once  in  their  schools.  It  may 
be  as  well,  perhaps,  to  dispel  this  illusion.  Why  is  it 
that  in  an  Irish  National  School  pupils  are  prohibited 
from  learning  Irish  inside  of  ordinary  school  hours,  unless 
they  have  passed  once  in  the  sixth  class  ?  Yet  this  is  a 
f;ict.  Why  is  it  again  that  "no  pupil  may  be  presented 
for  examination  in  Irish  who  has  not  at  least  reached  the 
fifth  class?"  Yet  this  also  is  a  fact.  Thus  restricted,  is 
it  any  wonder  that  the  Irish  language  has  been  making 
slow  progress  ?  (Hear,  hear. )  How  many  of  the  pupils 
attending  Irish  National  Schools  reach  the  fifth  class?  A 
small  percentage  verily  out  of  the  total  number  enrolled 
— certainly  not  more  than  one  out  of  every  five.  How 
many  remain  until  they  have  passed  once  in  the  sixth 
class,  and  thus  qualify  for  instruction  inside  of  ordinary 
school  hours,  provided  none  of  the  other  .subjects  of  our 
cram  results'  system  is  neglected  ?  A  smaller  jiercenlage 
still.  But  is  this  the  fault  of  the  teachers  ?  No  ;  it  is  the 
fault  of  the  system  under  which  he  teaches.  The  system 
ii  an  English  system,  not  an  Irish  system.  Either  the 
Irish  language  should  be  preserved,  or  it  should  not.     If 


THE   GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


it  should  not,  then  it  has  made  sufficient  progress  ;  but  if 
it  sliould — and  all  unprejudiced  persons  must  agree  that 
it  shi.uld— then  let  it  be  preserved.  Whether  we  be  suc- 
cessful or  not,  one  thing  is  certain,  and  it  is,  that  the 
National  Teachers  will  do  their  utmost  to  insure  its 
success."     (Loud  applause.) 

Another  cheering  fact  is  the  number  of  teachers  in  all 
pans  of  the  country  that  are  studying  the  Irish  lessons  in 
ihe  Weekly  Freeman.  We  would  ask  all  those  to  work 
up  local  public  opinion  through  the  local  papers,  and 
through  any  persons  of  influence  whom  they  may  meet. 

A  Congiess  will  be  held  in  the  Mansion  House,  Dublin, 
of  those  who  are  interested  in  the  preservation  ot  Irish  as 
a  spoken  language,  autl  who  (knowing  that  all  other 
efforts  are  futile  as  long  as  Irish  is  practically  excluded 
from  the  schools)  are  an.\ious  to  see  the  teacliers  in  the 
Training  Schools  afforded  an  opportunity  of  learning 
Irish.  The  Annual  Meeting  of  the  National  Teachers  of 
Ireland  will  also  deal  with  the  subject. 


The  fourth  volume  published  by  the  Irish  Literary 
Society  is  a  collection  of  the  addresses  of  Sir  Gavan 
Duffy.  Dr.  Sigerson,  and  Dr.  Douglas  Hyde,  on  Irish 
literature  .and  kindred  subjects.  The  volume  is  the  most 
interesting  yet  published.  Dr.  Hyde  is  engaged  on  a 
sketch  of  the  hi-tory  of  Irish  literature,  to  be  published  as 
a  volume  in  the  same  series. 


The/m/i  Echo  of  February  contains  some  of  the  poems 
ol  UoniicAt)  inóp  O'üíL-aig.  Abbot  of  Boyle,  and  a  re- 
print ol  the  first  pages  of  Coney's  Irish  Dictionary.  It 
also  has  a  photograph  and  some  articles  by  the  late 
Father  Keegan.  The  Gaodhal  ai  the  same  month  punts 
tire  continuation  of  a  tine  Gaelic  letter,  wliich  we  would 
\'  ish  to  see  translated,  with  notes.  We  are  glad  to  see 
that  the  Gaodhal  is  doing  well  financially.  The  Irisli 
A'net'ican  has  always  its  large  Gaelic  column.  We  have 
also  received  the  Pioz'idence  Vhiloi;  and  the  Irish  Repub- 
lic, with  s)mpathetic  articles. 


In  Scotland,  the  Celtic  Monthly  (threepence)  is  im- 
proving with  every  issue.  The  Oban  Times  and  Inverness 
Chronicle  gave  encouraging  notices  of  our  last  number. 
iMac  7 alia  is  still  the  best  of  the  Gaelic  papers. 


Mr.  David  Comyn's  papers  on  Irish  Illustrations  to 
Shakespeare,  which  attracted  so  much  attention  as  they 
appeared  in  the  IVeetly  Freeman,  are  now  collected  in 
pamphlet  form — price  sixpence.  Mr.  Comyn,  as  our 
feader»  know,  was  the  first  editor  of  the  Gaelic  Journal.

Munster  phrases  we  may  add  cá  ]-é  1  bpeigit  &n  cije  =: 
in  care  of  (=  1  nibun,  ijctonn  in  Connauglit).  For  T)úil, 
we  usually  hear  fpeip  in  the  West.  In  Meath,  the  sen- 
tence nil  ■oiiiL  ijAm  Jini,  is  usually  translated  "he  has 
no  element  for  it,"  from  the  fact  that  tjúiL  means  (I)  care 
for,  (2)  an  element,  creature. 

(2)  tlá  fin  Ag  an  oopuj-,  or  Ag  An  nTiopup?  which  is 
the  more  usual  ?  In  some  parts  even  the  adjective  is 
eclipsed  :  as,  «iip  &w  ^cnoc  mbuiẃe,  Aip  an  bpitpc 
nibim.  In  the  genitive  plural,  the  eclipsis  of  the  ad- 
jective is  still  common  ;  as,  eXà.  wis.  gcoj-  noub,  1  gcioiin 
c^vi  n-Ofòce. 


(3)  In  Munster  eifc  is  pronounced  (eish/),  and  ei^MJ  = 
ei)ig.  In  Ulster  éijMg  is  (aeree)  or,  sometimes,  eeree. 
In  Meath,  éipi  j  is  (ce/ee),  and  1  jppAiiD  is  (eree). 


(4)  ni'L  mem  mnib  é  'ôeaniri,  I  am  no  table  to  do  it, 
especially  when  prevented  by  poverty,  sickness,  &c., 
Ulster.  IliLim  lonAtiiJiL  (inne<itii<iil?  is  the  pronuncia- 
tion in-nol'  or  ing-ool'?)  cum  (or  &i\.]  é  xsétsncsm  (Mun- 
ster). These  two  seem  to  explain  the  western  nil  me 
(in-on'),  whicli  seems  to  be  =  m  mnbe.  There  are  two 
uses  of  the  phrase,  (0)  nib  me  (in-on')  é  •ôéAiiâẃ,  or  & 
■DeAUCd,  I  am  not  able  to  do  it,  (b)  mis  ci  csn  lo,  (in-on'), 
if  the  day  is  suitable.  In  a  former  number  of  this  Journal 
I  equated  (in-on')  with  m  lonciib  ;  I  believe  lliis  was 
wrong. 


(5)  Notice  the  different  pronunciations  of  the  verbal 
noun  of  the  verb  "  to  do  "  :  ■oeÁni-ó  (rfaan'-oo),  Ulster; 
TDÌongnaẃ  (deen'-oo),  W.  Connacht ;  •oiAnAni  (dee- 
on'-av)  Munster.  Iii  Munster,  the  verb  "  to  do  "  is,  in 
most  ol  its  parts,  a  regular  verb,  tiem  ;  in  Meath  cein  is 
sometimes  heard,  and  in  the  perfect,   pon.

STAY  NEAR  ME  IN  THE  VILLAGE, 

1.  I  went  fur  a  space  of  time  on  a  trip  that  I  miglit 
myself  view  from  me  the  sky,  round  through  the  islands 
on  a  chase,  as  a  doe  would  be  and  a  hound  after  it.  I 
met  a  little  young  lass,  and  if  I  met,  it  is  she  that  spoke 
sharply  :  "  If  you  are  a  person  that  has  meddled  (eloped) 
with  a  young  woman,  I  do  not  greatly  approve  of  your 
trade. 

2.  "  I  saw  a  man  on  the  mainUnd  going  without  shoe 
yesterday.  I  think  that  you  are  the  young  man  after 
whom  they  were  in  pursuit."  I  answered  the  maid, 
without  haughtiness,  bec.nuse  I  took  her  word  seriously  : 
"  Cease  your  mocking  any  more.  I  am  not  a  person  of 
that  kind. 

3.  If  you  do  not  come  over  near  me  and  (to)  drop  your 
speaking  in  vain,  I  will  go  before  (follow)  my  nose  out  on 
the  mainland  in  a  bound."  I  fell  into  sorrow  and  grief, 
and  asked  of  tlje  gentle  young  woman  :  "  Where  shall  we 
get  a  glass  to  drink  that  would  lift  this  sorrow  off  us  ?" 

4.  "  There  is  a  little  house  on  one  side  of  the  road, 
and  it  keeps  always  a  drop.  Go  you  and  rap  tlie  table, 
and  I  will  pay  the  score  myself."  When  I  got  to  the 
house  of  the  son  of  the  drinking,  I  was  timid  enough 
about  sitting,  for  fear  that  the  chase  might  come  up,  and 
that  the  young  woman  might  be  taken  from  me. 

5.  When  I  got  every  kind  of  what  was  fitting,  I 
thought  that  it  was  not  right  for  me  to  sit  down.  She 
said  :  "Be  you  singing,  and  you  shall  not  have  to  pay  a, 
farthing."  I  was  not  long  singing  till  the  young  folk 
gathered  into  the  house,  everyone  with  his  glass  in  his 
hand,  to  give  a  token  (of  respect)  to  the  pair  (of  us). 

6.  Liquor  was  abundant  on  (the)  table,  and  a  little  of 
it  a-drinking  in  the  country  (i.e.,  outside).  If  I  had 
drunk  O'Donnell's  gallon,  it  would  have  been  easy  to  pay 
my  reckoning.  When  we  h.-id  settled  the  balance  of  the 
reckoning,  this  is  what  the  young  woman  asked  me  : 
' '  Where  do  you  live,  or  do  you  keep  a  cabin  for  yourself  ?" 


7.  "When  I  am  a  while  in  the  drinking-house,  I  do 
not  make  store  of  (i.f.,  spare)  a  penny.  That  amount 
that  I  earn  in  the  day,  I  spend  in  pleasure  at  night." 
"  It  does  not  befit  a  pcr>on  of  your  sort  to  begin  with  the 
troubles  of  the  world.  It  is  better  for  us  to  wait  a  while 
till  we  both  make  a  store  (i e.,  save  something)." 

8.  "In  waiting  till  we  should  save  something,  a  good 
part  of  our  life  would  be  spent.  It  is  better  (or  us  to 
begin  young,  and  there  will  be  help  to  aid  us  again. 
Follow  you  me  in  the  road,  and  you  need  not  fear  the 
trouble  of  the  world — I  to  be  gathering  the  store  and  you 
will  get  your  lodging  free." 

9.  "  If  I  followed  you  in  the  road,  it  would  be  (a)  short 
(time)  till  you  would  lift  from  me  (leave  me),  till  you 
would  begin  playing  and  drinking  ;  and  it  be  (a)  short 
(time)  that  you  yourself  would  be  a  treasure  (to  me). 
But  stay  in  the  village  near  me,  and  I  will  be  of  the 
(same)  fashion  (i.e.,  mind)  with  yourself.  You  shall  get 
land  enough,  and  me  for  ever  as  wife." 

10.  I  cannot  praise  her  with  (sufficient)  goodness.  It 
is  she  that  has  distracted  my  heart.  There  is  not  a 
person  (of  those)  that  would  see  the  jewel  that  would  nut 
fall  greatly  lamenting.  I  have  not  seen  her  equal  yet  in 
(any)  direction  that  I  take  on  the  road.  If  she  were  seen 
in  Ballinamore,  there  would  be  young  girls  for  a  penny. 


NOTES  ON  THE  ABOVE  SONG. 

The  author  of  this  song  was  Peter  Walsh,  a  tailor,  who 
lived  in  Ballinamore,  in  the  County  of  Donegal,  a  place 
mentioned  by  him  in  the  last  verse.  It  was  obtained  from 
a  woman  named  Mary  Conaghan,  who  lives  in  Altadish, 
GlenswiUy,  in  the  same  county.  Much  as  the  poetry  of 
Munster  or  Connaught  is  praised,  I  myself  believe  that  I 
have  never  heard  a  poem  more  sweetly  worded  or  more 
musically   composed  than  this.

No.  4.S  of  this  Journal  was  issued  in  the  end  of  February, 
and  No.  49  in  the  end  of  March.  Instead  of  publishing 
the  present  issue  at  the  end  of  April,  we  have  thought  it 
better  to  date  it  May  1st,  and  intend  to  issue  the  Journal 
in  future  on  the  fir-ii  of  each  month.  Our  readers  will 
notice,  therefore,  that  there  is  no  April  number.  When 
writing  for  any  issue  nf  the  Journal,  the  number  should  be 
mentioned,  and  not  the  month  of  publication. 


Nos.  4  and  4S  of  the  Journal  are  out  of  print.  All  the 
other  numbers  can  be  had,  post  free,  for  sixpence  each. 
No.  14  contains  the  complete  text  of  the  "  Children  of 
Tuireann."  Nos.  12  and  13  contain  three  texts 
(O'Curry's.  Windisch'~  and  O'Flanagan's)  of  the  "Chil- 
dren of  Usna,"  with  translation,  and  also  the  complete 
text  of  the  later  version  of  the  same  tale. 


in  the  study  and  teaching  ol  Gaelic.  The  Congress  ex- 
tended a  warm  welcome  to  Mr.  MacNeill  and  the  others 
who  attended  on  behalf  of  the  Gaelic  League. 


The  Gaelic  Leagues  of  Dublin  and  Derry  continue  their 
splendid  work  with  unabating  zeal.  Irish  classes  have 
been  established,  with  much  success,  in  connection  with 
the  BeTast  Fie'd  Club.  Mr.  P.  J.  O'Shea  conducts  the 
classes,  which  include  some  of  the  chief  people  in  Belfast. 
On  17th  April,  an  "  Irish  Night  "  was  held  ;  the  pro- 
gramme was  printed  in  Irish,  and  the  majority  of  the 
items  were  in  the  vernacular.  In  Cork,  on  22nd  April, 
the  Mayor  presided  at  a  meeting  called  for  the  purpose  of 
establishing  a  branch  of  the  Gaelic  League.  Dean 
MacSwiney,  Mr.  Denny  Lane,  Mr.  Maurice  Healy, 
Father  O'Leary,  and  other  representative  Cork  men 
spoke,  and  classes  will  be  established  forthwith. 


The  language  is  being  studied  privately  by  verv  many  in 
Galway,  Tuam,  Ballina,  various  parts  of  Donegal,  Long- 
ford, and  many  places  in  Cork  and  Kerry.  There  is 
hardly  any  newspaper'  of  importance  in  Ireland  which 
does  not,  in  some  way  or  other,  advocate  Irish  studies. 


The  Congress  held  in  the  Mansion  House.  Dublin,  on 
Tuesday,  27th  March,  wns  a  great  success.  There  was  a 
large  and  enthusiastic  .ittend.ince  ofladies  and  gentlemen 
from  Dublin,  and  from  the  coun!ry.  As  a  speaker  re- 
marked, the  respect  shown  to  the  old  language  in  centres 
like  Dublin  will  do  a  great  deal  to  remove  from  people's 
minds  the  strange  old  prejudice  that  the  speaking  of 
Irish  is  a  sign  of  ignorance  and  vulgarity.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  National  Teachers  and  other,  from  the  Gaelic- 
speaking  districts,  will  return  with  renewed  vigour  to  their 
work  of  teaching  their  friends  to  love,  cherish  and  culti- 
vate the  old  tongue.  Among  those  present  at  the  Con- 
gress were  mnnv  well-known  workers  in  the  Gaelic  cause, 
and  old  friends  of  this  Journal.  The  questions  brought 
before  the  Congress  are  familiar  to  all  our  readers,  so  we 
need  not  speak  of  them  at  present. 


At  the  Congress  of  the  National  Teachers  ot  Ireland, 
held  on  the  day  after  the  Mansion  Hou^e  meeting,  the 
usual  resolution  advocating  the  teaching  of  Irish  was  re- 
ceived with  more  than  wonted  warmth.  It  was  supported 
by  several  teachers,  who  were  themselves  quite  at  home 


The  chiel  Gaelic  news  from  America  is  the  establish- 
ment of  a  Gaelic  Society,  on  a  very  large  scale,  in  Provi- 
dence, R.I.  Classes  have  been  set  on  foot  and  numbers 
of  enthusiastic  students  enrolle^l.  As  usual,  the  credit  of 
this  is  due  to  one  or  two  enthusiastic  Irishmen,  the  chie 
being  Father  T.  E.  Ryan  and  Mr.  Henehan.  The  most 
influential  papers  of  that  part  of  the  States  have  taken 
up  the  question  warmly,  and  the  smallest  State  of  the 
Union  is  now  likely  to  do  most  for  the  old  Gaelic  tongue. 


The  existing  Societies  in  New  York,  Philadelphia,  &c., 
continue  their  work,  and  many  students  of  Irish  are  feund 
in  Brooklyn,  Boston,  San  Francisco,  and  other  centres. 
All  the  Irish-.A.merican  papers  are  unceasing  in  their 
efforts  to  encourage  Irishmen  abroad  to  learn  something 
of  their  mother-tongue. 


The  SâoẂAt,  Irish  Echo  and  Mac  Talla  are,  as  usual, 
full  of  interesting  matter.  We  thank  them  for  their  flat- 
tering notices  of  this  Journal.  The  Irish- American  still 
gives  two  columns  of  Gaelic  every  week.    At  home,  the 


THE    GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


Tuani    News,    Weekly   Freeman    and    United  Ireland 
continue  to  publish  Irish  literature. 

We  have  to  thank  the  various  GaeUc  Societies,  and 
various  gentlemen  in  Ireland  and  abroad,  who  have  gone 
to  much  pains  to  extend  the  circulation  of  the  Joii'nal. 
Suggestions  of  any  kind  will  be  carefully  considered. 

In  the  present  issue  we  give  specimens  of  the  spoken 
Gaelic  of  Kerry,  Cork,  East  Connaught,  and  Donegal. 


EASY  LESSONS  IN  IRISH. 

{Continued.) 

These  Lessons  were  begun  in  No.  48,  which  is  now  out 
of  print.  The  first  part  will  soon  be  issued  in  book  form, 
and  improvements  and  suggestions  are  invited.  In  pre- 
vious lessons,  §§  23,  38,  add  :  1111  (im),  butter  ;  Cl^o1u 
(thrum),  heavy,  feot  (shöl),  a  sad.  See,  also,  g§  78,  80. 
The  pronunciation  of  an  is  given  in  §  19  ;  it  is  almost  like 
an-  in  annoy.  It  would  not  be  advisable,  as  some  suggest, 
to  print  over  each  exercise  all  the  words  used  in  it. 

EXERCISE  XIV. 

§  103.   THE  DIGRAPHS  IN  IRISH. 

For  the  meaning  of  digraph,  see  §  90. 
Some  digraphs  represent  longvowel-sounds, 
and  others  represent  short  vowel-sounds. 

§  104.  The  long  vowel-sounds  are  often 
represented  by  digraphs  consisting  of  two 
vowels,  one  of  which    is   MARKED  LONG. 
Thus : — 
Ŵ1  is  sounded  like  Á,  i.e.,  like  phonetic  symbol  au 


§  105.  As  will  lie  seen,  these  digraphs  are  formed  by 
adding  1  to  the  vowels  &,  é,  6,  ú  ;  and  the  sound  of  the 
vowel  which  is  marked  long  is  given  to  the  whole  digraph. 
The  only  difference  between  ii,  01,  úi  and  a,  6,  Ú,  is  that 
the  consonants  which  follow  the  ái,  Ó1,  til  are  slender. 
(See  §8.) 

§  106.  Note. — In  Ulster  ii  is  pronounced  (aa),  and 
61  (au).     (See  §14.) 

§  107.  Examples  for  pronunciation  only  : 
)'Áile  (saul'-ë),  bÁi]-  (baush),  \iy\\  (faush) ; 
céif  (kaesh),  éille  (ae/'é),  ■çé\\\  (faer) ;  ppóif- 
■oe)  prösh-í/ë),  ciJif  (koosh). 

§  108.  Words. 

ixx:  (au/),  a  place  lái-otp  (Laurf'-ir),  strong 

CÄibin  (kaub'-een*),  a  mile    (meel'-ë),    a    thou-

§  íio.  Art  is  not  wearing  (see  §  4.0)  a 
new  coat.  Art  is  strong  and  healthy.  Do 
not  leave  a  pitcher  on  the  floor.  Dry  turf. 
The  place  is  not  wholesome.  The  strong 
horse  is  going  to  the  road.  She  is  young, 
she  is  not  strong.  The  ship  is.  strong,  the 
boat  is  weak.  The  child  is  brown-haired. 
The  place  is  green.  The  young  horse  is 
safe  and  sound  ffiÁn,  yolÌÁin).  Leave  a 
sod  of  turf  on  the  floor.  There  is  not  a 
sod  of  turf  on  the  floor.  Welcome.  Warm

EXERCISE   XIV. 

§  III.  Other  examples  of  the  sounds  of 
Á1,  éi,  01,  in  : — 

bpifce  (bnsh'-/é),  broken  éiiMiin  (aer'-i«),  Ireland 

C&\\a  (kaush'-f),  cheese  Siiil  (sool),  the  eye 

Liip  (Lau;),  a  mare  Stiij-ce  (soosh'-ZfO,  a  Hail 

Salle  (saul'-t'),  salt  water,  Ciiipne     (thoor'-wr-),    a 

the  salt  sea  spinning-wheel 

Stxáit)  (srauí/),  a  street 

§  112.  Many  proper  names  involve  the 
sound  of  Á1  ;  thus,  -ajtc,  'pl-A"''',  give  rise  to 
the  diminutives  AjtCAjAn,  VLAnnAjÁn 
(little  Art,  Flann),  hence  the  family  names 
O'îl-AnrAjÁm  (5  horth'-tì-gaun),  O'^LAtmA- 
jÁiti  (ô  floN'-ä-gaun),  literally,  grandson  of 
little  Art,  Flann  ;  the  forms  from  which  the 
ordinary  O'Hartigan,  OTlanagan,  are 
taken. 

§  113.  The  preposition  "  with  "(  =  "  along 
with  ")  is  translated  by  le  (/e,  almost  like  le 
in  let) ;  as,  acá  A\\'c  le  Conn,  Art  is  with 
Conn.  This  le  prefixes  h  to  a  vowel  ;  as, 
ACÁ  Conn  le  h-Ajic  (horth),  Conn  is  with 
Art. 

§  114.  The  preposition  "  to  "  (to  a  place) 
is  translated  by  50  (gu)  when  no  article 
follows  ;  as,  50  5|iÁnÁ]iT),  to  Granard. 
When  a  vowel  follows,  h  is  prefixed  ;  as, 
50  h-Áic,  to  a  place.  When  the  article  fol- 
lows, 50  is  never  used,  but  t)o'n  (dhûn)  is 
used  =  "  to  the  "  ;  as,  •oo'n  Áic,  to  the  place.

§  117.  The  wool  and  the  spinning-wheel 
are  at  the  door.  Leave  the  wool  at  the 
spinning-wheel.  The  wool  is  soft,  the 
wheel  is  broken.  I  am  not  going  to  the 
the  place.  Stay  in  Ireland  yet.  Leave  the 
horse  and  the  mare  at  the  well.  Conn 
O'Hartigan  is  not  in  Ireland.  The  salt- 
water is  not  sweet.  The  ship  and  the  big 
boat  are  on  the  salt-water,  going  to  Ireland. 
I  am  not  going  to  Ireland  I  am  going 
with  Conn  O'Finegan. 

EXERCISE  XV. 

§    IlS.     OTHER   DIGRAPHS. 

éA  is  pronounced  like  é,  that  is,  ac 

eÁ  „  „      Á,       „       au 

io  ,,  „      1,        „       ee 

In  these, also, it  will  be  noticed,  the  digraph 

is  pronounced  practically  with  the  sound  of 

the  vowel  marked  long — the  other  vowel  is 

hardly  sounded,  thus  : — 

Véu]i  is  pronounced  (faer),  i]-leÁn  (eesh'- 
/aun),  cio]'  (kees). 

§  1 19.  Note  I — é&  is  now  generally  spelled  eu  ;  as, 
ye\i\\  (faei ),  grass.  In  Munster,  in  words  of  one  syllable, 
é.1  or  eu  is  pronounced  ee'-o  ;  thus,  yeup  (fee'-or). 

Note  2 — ei  is  used,  and  wrongly,  in  words  like  jea^xp, 
fe.il^l^,  where  eŵ,  without  any  mark  of  length,  should  be 
used.  Lengthening  of  the  long  vowel-sound  noticed  in 
such  words  is  caused  by  the  double  \\  (see  §  77). 

Note  3 — We  would  advise  learners  always  to  pronounce 
io  like  i,  or  ee.  In  many  monosyllables  io  is  yet  pro- 
nounced ee'-fi ;  as,  p'oii  (fee'-tin),  wine. 

§  120.  CeuT)  mile  yÁtlce !  a  hundred

§  123.  The  wine  is  strong.  The  strong 
wine  is  not  wholesome.  The  child  is  not 
strong,  he  is  sick  (and)  weak.  The  well  is 
not  clean,  leave  a  pitcher  at  the  well. 
James  and  Art  are  not  in  Ireland.  Leave 
the  horse  and  the  mare  at  the  meadow.  A 
tall  man.  Long  grass.  The  grass  is  long 
and  heavy.  The  man  is  going  down  to 
Granard  with  a  young  horse.  Sell  the 
spinning-wheel  :  do  not  sell  the  wool  yet. 
The  meadow  is  heavy. 

EXERCISE   XVI; 

§    124.     OTHER   DIGRAPHS  :    «6   AND   AO. 

|-  are  pronounced  like  ae  in  Gaelic. 

Thus  :  Iab  (Lae),  Aon  (aen).  In  older 
Irish  Ao  is  scarcely  ever  met  with,  Ae  being 
the  usual  form. 

§  125.  In  Connaught  «o  is  pronounced  (ee).  This  is 
really  the  pronunciation  of  «01.  In  Ulster,  &o  is  pro- 
nounced like  French  «.  In  words  of  one  syllable,  ao  is 
often  pronounced  ae'-ii,  in  Connaught,  ee'-u,  a^,  AoL 
(ae'-ûl,  ee'-ül),  lime.  We  would  advise  learners  to 
pronounce  ao  like  Ae,  always. 

§  126.  "In  the"  is  not  translated  by  in 
An,  but  by  in  ^-An  (in  san),  now  always 
spelled  in^'  An  ;  as,  inj'  An  Áic  (ins  an  ZMt), 
in  the  place ;  in  Áic,  in  a  place.

Ireland.  James  O'Hartigan  is  not  in  Ire- 
land. He  is  not  in  the  place.  Leave  the 
horse  in  the  meadow  yet.  There  is  whole-

4.  &e  and  &o  are  both  pronounced  like  ae  in  Gaflic. 

5.  Most  of  the  digraplis  were  formerly  pronounced,  like

country — good-bye.  Conn  and  another 
man  are  on  the  road.  Conn  is  not  big; 
Art  is  big.  Una  is  white-haired,  Conn  is 
brown-haired.  The  ship  is  beautiful,  she  is 
high  and  long.  The  fire  is  Iiot.  There  is 
water  in  the  well. 

EXERCISE  XX. 

§  142.  The  digraphs  when  obscure. 

In  simple  words  of  two  syllables  (that 
is,  words  not  formed  from  others  by 
adding  a  termination)  the  first  syllable  is 
the  one  accented,  as  we  have  seen  already  ; 
as  CApẃlt  (kop'-aL),  a  horse.  The  vowel 
sound  of  the  last  syllable  is  then  usually 
obscure,  as  we  have  already  seen,  and  this 
is  true  when  that  vowel  sound  is  repre- 
sented by  any  of  the  digraphs  given  in 
§  132. 

Thus —

He  is  not  sick  ;  he  is  working  on  the  road 
to  Derry.  There  is  a  rock  at  the  well,  and 
there  is  a  tree  growing  at  the  door.  There 
is  a  fire  on  the  road.  Close  the  door  ;  the 
day  is  cold.     Good-bye.

NOTES  ON  IRISH  ETYMOLOGY. 

By  TomÁs  ó  Flannaoile. 

I.  Gŵjinŵc,  ■pAiTinAu,  frojrtiAH,  jeniipeAU. 

It  is  pretty  certain  that  the  ancient  pagan  Irish  reckoned 
at  first  but  two  seasons  in  their  year — summer  and  winter 
Not  to  mention  oiher  authorities,  the  Haiieian  MS. 
(British  Museum),  H.I.B.  5280,  p.  38— quoted  by 
O'Donovan  in  the  Introduction  to  his  edition  of  the  ' '  Book 
of  Rights  " — gives  the  following:  'dp  i]- tie  noinn  no 
biT>  I'op  in  ni-ptiA-OAni  Ant)  ,1.  in  j'Anipûü  ó  beilcme 
CO  S.iniiiin,  icui"  in  jeimpet)  ó  SaniAin  co  belcme," 
i.e.,  for  it  is  tivo  divisions  used  to  be  on  the  year  then, 
namely,  the  summer  from  May  to  November,  and  the 
winter  from  November  to  May.  We  know  too  that  other 
ancient  nations  recognised  but  two  seasons  in  the  year. 
In  the  Bible  only  ^two  seasons  are  mentioned,  summer 


and  winter,  and  in  many  languages  to  this  day  the  ex- 
pression '  summer  and  winter '  is  popularly  used  for  'the 
whole  year.' 

The  oldest  and  simplest  Irish  names  for  these  two 
seasons  were  |-atn=summev,  and  5Am  =  winter.  In  later 
times  the  compounds  r<vtn-pAt)  =  ' summer-part.'  and 
5em-fe-o=  '  winter  part,'  became  more  usual  in  Ireland. 
They  are  the  forms  used  in  the  extract  given  above,  and 
it  is  from  them  that  we  have  Timrvaw  and  jeiiiifieAW,  tlie 
present  Irish  names  for  summer  and  winter  respectively. 
The  original  simple  names,  however,  survived  for  a  long 
time  after  the  fuller  compound  forms  came  into  use. 
These  primitive  words,  SAM  and  gam,  also  belonged 
originally  to  the  Cymric  Celts,  and  they  are  substantially 
the  forms  still  used  in  Welsh  for  the  names  of  the  two 
chief  seasons.  They  have,  however,  suffered  more  change 
in  Welsh  than  they  suffered  in  Irish,  for  instead  of  sam 
and  gam,  or  even  samh  and  gamh,  the  Welsh  say  and 
write  /ítí/and  gauaf*  The  /  in  these  words  sounds  as 
English  -■,  and  represents  the  aspirated  ;«,  which  we  ex- 
press by  til  or  mh.  Initial  5  in  mo~t  Celtic  words  has 
been  preserved  in  Irish,  but  became  permanently  changed 
to  h  in  Welsh  at  an  early  period — thuiigh  there  is  evidence 
to  show  that  the  change  occurred  later  tlian  the  Christian 
era.  Thus,  cur  ^-alinn  (salt),  \(i&.f\  (old),  pol  (seed), 
are  weakened  ir  Welsh  to  halen,  hen  and  hil  respectively. 
This,  it  will  be  remembered,  is  what  the  Greeks  also  did 
with  their  initial  S  as  a  general  rule,  whilst  the  Latins 
retained  it — which  is  one  of  the  proofs  that  Latin'.is  in 
many  respects  older  than  Greek.  Iiish,  however,  has 
some  forms  which  are  older  than  Welsh,  Greek  or  Latin 
—but  this  is  not  the  immediate  point  in  hand. 

In  Irish  the  forms  f<sin  and  501m  continued — as  I  have 
already  said — to  be  used  for  a  long  time  after  the  adop- 
tion  of    the    compound    forms   ]-Ami\at)   and    gemifeo. 
Though  they  are  no  longer  in  actual  use  with  us,   they 
j  are  found  in  ancient  literature.     In  the   ^\ŵpj    Chobuini- 
I  cille,  as  given  in  the  Liber  Hymnorum.  there  are  some 
!  verses  quoted  (in  a  gloss  on  the  words  "  pceo  i\ein  fic  ") 
where  the  line  occurs  :  "  fo  ■ç&at  pirn  pnijir)  54m,"  i.e., 
I  gone  hath  summer,  snoweth  winter — in  which  happily  we 
have  examples  of  tioth  words.     In  the  Leibap  Liigneic, 
or  '  Book  of  I.einster.'  there  is  a  poem  which  we  are  told 
St.    Moiling   compelled   the   devil    to  recite— perhaps   I 
should  say  compose  —and  in  which  occur  the  lines  : — 

"  Do^ni  coib  miicc  Tie  x>o  mm 
1p  spmn  ecpoct;  iinbi  ■ç&m — " 

that  is,  as  translated  by  O'Curry,  Who  doth  the  will  of 
the  Son  of  God  of  heaven,  is  a  brilliant  sun,  around  which 
is  summer.f  In  the  Annals  of  the  IV.  MM.,  under  A.D. 
1151,  we  find  the  entry — "  5<iin  lifionic,  -^&etác, 
Ainbcionic  co  ppotc  n-oeapriiiip " — translated  by 
O'Donovan  :  A  changeable,  windy,  stormy  winter,  with 
great  rain.  The  Four  Masters,  one  might  expect,  would 
write  their  annals  in  the  language  of  their  own  time,  but 
from  their  profession,  and  from  their  long  study  of  ancient 
writings,  they  often  used,  and  could  scarcely  lielp  using, 
old  words,  old  idioms,  and  old  grammatical  forms  in  their 
seventeenth  century  Irish,  the  result  being  a  style  of  very 
mixed  character.  The  word  5^111  w.-rs  no  doubt  practically 
olisolete  in  their  time,  but,  if  used,  the  form  would  be 
jÄtii  and  not  gdm,  whilst  there  is  little  doubt  it  was  still 

*  Pronounce  /íá/ like  an  Irish  'hjaiii,'  or  like  the 
English  verb  halve,  z.nA gaiiaf\n  two  syllables,  like  an  Irish 
'  gdiweAiii,'  or  like  an  English  '  gui-av ' — first  syllable  as 
in  guide.

THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


used  in  tlie  twelfth  century,  though  as  yet  probably  in 
the  unaffected  form  54111. 

With  regard  to  this  word  54111,  although  this  is  the 
more  usual  ancient  form,  still  from  the  analogy  of  the 
Welsh  gaiiaf  for  an  older  *gaiant,  the  Latin  hiems,  the 
Greek  x^'^f^"-  (winter),  the  Sanscrit,  hima  (snow), 
found  in  //i>/ia-laj'a='  snoviy  mountains'  or  'snow's 
abode,'  from  the  analogy,  too,  of  our  own  5etn-^eT) 
(.whence  seim-iAeAW),  we  should  expect  rather  a  form 
with  a  slender  vowel,  as  '54ini'  or  '5eim.'  As  a  matter 
of  fact,  this  very  54nii  is  also  found  :  e.g.,  the  line  quoted 
above  from  the  -diiipa,  reads  in  O'Beirne  Crowe's  edition 
from  leabap  114  h-tii-6pe :  "Sni5i-o  541111,  po):4ic 
f4iii."  So  also  we  fmd  56111  in  other  compounds  besides 
5em-i\eü,  for  instance,  5em-4i'Oce*  =  a  winter's  night 
(Le4b4p  b|\e4C). 

Before  I  leave  54111,  I  may  call  to  mind  the  fact  that, 
though  the  word  is  no  longer  a  living  current  name  for 
winter,  we  have  at  least  one  instance  of  its  use  in  a  place- 
name — namely,  Sb4b  54111,  the  Irish  name  for  the  mis- 
called '  Ox  Mountains,'  which  form  part  of  the  boundary 
between  the  counties  of  Sligo  and  Mayo.  Sbi4b  54iii 
is  the  name  of  these  mountains  in  all  our  native  Irish 
writers,  and  is  evidently  very  ancient.  54111  here  shows 
no  trace  of  inflection.  It  is  either  genitive  singular,  with 
the  inflection  lost,  the  name  in  that  case  meaning  'snowy 
mountain,'  or  a  genitive  plural,  the  name  then  meaning 
'  mount  of  snows,'  rather  than  '  mount  of  winters.'  From 
the  similarity,  however,  of  54111  to  the  living  word  •04111 
(ox),  someone  with  little  knowledge  of  the  language — and, 
doubtless,  with  the  '  bovine  cultus  '  strong  on  his  bovine 
brain— imagined  it  could  mean  nothing  but  'Ox  Moun- 
tains,' and  the  mistranslation  is  copied  from  one  map 
to  another.  Sbi4b  54111  is  indeed,  in  one  sense,  our  Irish 
Himalaya,  and  the  name  is  to  be  compared  with  that  of 
SU4b-j'ne4cc4  =  ' snowy-mountain  '  in  Inishowen, 
'Opuitii-)"ne4cc4=' snowy-ridge  '  in  Co.  Monaghan 
(O'Curry)  ;  Snae-fell  (a  Norse  name),  in  the  Isle  of  Man  ; 
Snoivdon,  in  N.  Wales,  and  such  like. 

As  to  the  -p4'o  in  i-4iii-]\4t>  which,  owing  to  the  law  of 
c4ol  Le  c4ol,  became  -^leo  in  5em-j\eT),  I  believe  it  to  be 
a  shortened  and  broken  form  of  jiiiice,  which,  though  it 
now  only  means  a  quarter  of  the  year,  a  season,  a  term 
of  three  months,  must  originally  have  meant  a  part,  any 
part  or  division.  The  word  ^litce,  I  take  it,  has  lost  an 
initial  p,  and  is  forp-)i4ic-e=:prat  =  part-,  just  as  (ló  is  for 
*plió,  L4n  for  *pl4ii,  iM4riifor  *ppi4ni,  etc.  Two  classes 
of  words  are  formed  with  this  ending — (I)  Collectives,  as 
L40c-i\4i5,  11105-^46,  HI  4c-i\4Í>,  etc.,  which  were  anciently 
declined  as  feminines  singular,  but  are  now  considered 
plurals,  and  written  L4oc-i\4iò,  e4cp4it>,  7c.,  and  (2) 
singulars,  like  i'4iii-i\4-ò,  5eiiii-pe4t),  i-on-p4-ò,  puilpe4t), 
7c.,  which  were  sometimes  used  as  masculines  and  some- 
times neuters  — now  always  masculines.  t40c-p4T)  means, 
therefore,  as  Windisch  translates  it,  A'rieger-schaar, 
warrior-division,  hero-kind,  -]\4-o  =  schaar  =  part,  share  or 
division. 

I  have  suggested  that  our  word  54ni  (winter)  originally 
meant  snow,  like  the  hiina  in  Hima-laya,  and  that  most 
probably  this  is  the  meaning  we  should  give  the  word  in 
the  name  sLi4b  S*"'.  S^'n-P^^  would  then  mean  the 
'snow-part,'  the  'snowy  time'  or  division  of  the  year. 
What  did  i-4m  mean  originally,  or  is  this  to  inquire  too 
curiously  ?  There  can  be  little  doubt  that  it  is  the  same 
word  as  sum  in  the  English  «<;«-mer,  and  soni  in  the 
German  som-mex.     But  what  is  the  meaning  of  this  SAM, 


*  There  is  in  Maynooth  College  Library  a  collection  of 
Stories,  called  "Jâ'oui'òe  seup  n4  5e4ih-oi'Dce." 


SOM  or  SUM  ?  I  do  not  think  it  can  mean  anything  else 
but  sun.  Sam  and  gam  then  are  the  sun  and  the  snow, 
the  sunny  time  and  the  snowy  time.  But  sam  is  not  the 
Irish  word  for  sun,  neither  is  it  a  Teutonic  word,  unless 
SUM  or  so.M  be  the  original  of  sun  and  sotine.  Cormac, 
in  his  Glossary,  suggested  a  Hebrew  origin  of  the  word 
SAM,  saying  that  in  that  language  the  word  meant  sun. 
It  is  undoubtedly  true  that  the  Hebrew  word  for  sun  may 
hz  \i'i\\.\K\\  shimsh,  shemsh,  shamsh,  or  even  sams,  as  in 
the  proper  name  Samson,  as  given  in  the  Vulgate.  It  is 
admitted  that  this  proper  name  signifies  either  'sun-like' 
or  a  '  splendid  sun,'  and  that  it  is  the  first  part  which 
means  sun.  We  will  not  say  that  the  Celts  and  Teutons 
borrowed  this  word  from  the  Hebrews,  but  is  it  not 
possible  that  it  is  a  word  common  to  all  three  races,  only 
that  in  the  Hebrew  alone  it  has  its  true  and  ultimate 
explanation?  In  the  last  century  and  beginning  of  this 
everything  in  Irish  was  traced,  without  any  real  grounds, 
to  Hebrew  and  Phoenician,  but  those  who  compared  them 
seem  to  have  known  little  of  either  Irish  or  Hebrew. 
But  now  we  have  gone  to  the  other  extreme,  never  think- 
ing of  the  Hebrew,  and  ridiculing  every  comparison  that 
is  made  between  them.  No  one  who  knows  Irish  seems 
to  learn  Hebrew,  and  no  one  who  knows  Hebrew  seems 
to  learn  Irish,  or  at  any  rate  no  one  seems  to  know 
enough  of  both  to  make  an  intelligent  comparison.  The 
Aryan  character  of  the  Celtic  dialects  no  one  now  doubts, 
but  is  it  quite  certain  that  the  Semitic  and  Aryan  tongues 
have  no  common  roots  ?  I  do  not  think  it  is,  and  I  believe 
the  venerable  Cormac  made  many  a  wilder  shot  than  when 
he  compared  the  Irish  i"4m  'summer,'  with  the  Hebrew 
Samson,  the  'sun-like.' 

Besides  p4nip4-o  and  5enii\e'0,  the  ancient  Irish  had 
two  other  names  for  each  of  their  divisions  of  the  year, 
but  still  from  the  same  roots,  p4ni  and  54m.  For  summer 
they  had  p4nii.-ucc  and  i-4ni4in,  and  for  winter,  54mpucc 
and  54014111.  These  names  arose  at  dififerent  times  and, 
perhaps,  were  used  in  different  parts  of  the  country. 
34mpucc  and  54iiipucc  are  given  in  O'Donovan's  Essay, 
already  referred  to,  quoted  from  the  law  tract,  H-3-18, 
p.  13,  T.C.D.  They  do  not  seem  to  have  got  into  general 
use,  or,  if  they  ever  did,  they  gave  way  to  |-4nij\4T)  and 
5enipe'0,  and  became  obsolete.  They  are,  however,  of 
the  very  same  formation  and  meaning  as  the  other  names, 
for  the  one  is  i-4in-chucc  — summer  time  or  period,  the 
other,  54ni-chucc  =  winter-time  or  period,  for  cucc 
(U'Reilly)  means  time,  season  or  period.  In  these  two 
words  we  find  a  relic  of  old  Irish  pronunciation,  that  is 
the  aspirated  c  (cli)  represented  by  p,  just  as  in  a  few 
words  yet  the  same  thing  holds,  e.g.,  fpuc  (stream),  «nd 
ppuc4n  (streamlet),  are  pronounced  almost  like  ppup 
and  pi\up4ii.  The  progress — or  rather  the  deterioration — 
of  the  aspirated  c  down  to  a  mere  h,  as  it  is  at  present, 
was  probably  this  :  At  first  it  was  a  real  dental  aspirate, 
as  it  is  in  Welsh  to  this  day  (cf.  mam  a  Mfíí/=  mother  and 
father),  corresponding  to  the  sound  of  the  Greek  Thcta 
and  to  the  English  th  in  think.  This  next  turned  into  an 
/sound,  which  survived  in  a  few  words,  but  mostly  passed 
into  the  corresponding  guttural  aspirate  ch,  which  in  time 
became  weakened  to  h.  It  is  well-known  that  the 
aspirates  freely  interchange  with  each  other  in  all  the 
Aryan  languages. 

And  now  for  i"4m4in.  I  hold  that  this  word  was 
originally  used  to  mean  the  summer,  that  it  was  a  synonym 
of  p4ni)\4D  and  p4nipucc,  that  it  was  probably  earlier  in 
origin  than  either  of  these,  but  that  in  its  true  sense  it 
eventually  gave  way  to  the  others,  especially  the  former, 
and  that  it  survived  only  in  a  very  restricted  sense.  I  do 
not  know  if  anyone  has  as  yet  questioned  the  explanation

of  i"Ani<iiii  given  in  all  the  old  Irish  authorities,  and 
believed  in  apparently  by  O'Donovan.  If  not,  it  is  time

do.  Nothing  but  confu-ion  springs  from  making  ^ruiii  a 
part  of  this  word  |-imûni.  Whatever  may  be  said  of 
fuin — whether  it  is  a  genuine  Irish  word  or  not — as  a 
matter  of  fact,  ]'Äni<iin  never  was  the  end  of  summer,  even 
in  its  later  and  restricted  sense  it  meant  November,  which 
was  the  first  month  of  winter,  and  tû  Soimti.5,  or  Novem- 
ber-day, is  siill  with  us  the  first  of  winter.  This  is  one 
reason  why  ^-imini  cannot  be  'i-jnuruin  ' — now  for  some 
others.  So.mûin  exists  in  Welsh,  and  (like  \&m  and  ^Am) 
seems  to  have  been  common  to  all  the  Cells  before  they 
separated.  As  \&m  with  the  Welsh  became  /;Ci/,  so 
r.iniAiti  sur\'ived  with  them  in  the  form  hefin,  corres- 
ponding with  cur  word  exactly,  and  observing  the  law  of 
CAoL  be  caol,  which  exists  to  a  considerable  extent  even 
in  Welsh.  But  it  does  not  mean  -u-'inter  in  Welsh,  nor 
Noi'Cinber,  it  means  the  summer-time,  though  rarer  than 
hâf  and  perhaps  now  obsolete.  In  the  compounds, 
Cynlejiii  and  jMekefin,  the  word  plainly  means  summer. 
C)'«fe/?i/ is  an  ancient  and  poetical  name  for  May— now 
they  use  Jl/iii — and  clearly  means  cynt-hefiii  or  first- 
summer.  We  have  this  very  same  word  for  May  (as  well 
as  bealcdine),  viz.,  the  O.  Ir.  cécceiiiAni  =  céc-i'-5m<Mn 
(first  summer),  used  in  the  beautiful  poem  on  the  May 
time  attributed  to  Fionn  son  of  Cumhall  (in  the  llloic- 
5tiiniii\c.i  V'"")"  iind  in  other  old  Irish  writings,  reduced 
in  later  times  to  the  form  céi-oeirii  (O'Donovan 's  Irish 
Grammar,  p.  97),  but  in  the  Highlands  toCéirem,  which 
is  used  as  much  as  be^ilcjiiie.  So  the  Welsh  Mehefin 
(June)  is  plainly  '  Medd-hefin'  =  mid-summer,  and  the 
Irish  ineiceam  (June)  =  tneT)-)'em  =  me'D-|-iiii,  or  mid- 
summer. In  middle  Irish  we  find  lllecemm  and 
niicenini  (as  in  Mac  Con-glinne's  Vision),  but  the  forms 
ceineam  and  nieiceoiiii  do  not  necessarily  imply  that  any 
syllable  has  been  lost,  but  may  represent  older  forms, 
céiccem  and  meceiii  (for  céc-]-.im  and  nieu-i-im  respec- 
tively), before  the  extra  syllable  was  assumed. 

What  then  is  |-Aiii.iin  or  he/in?  A  comparison  with 
j-Amiva-D  and  fjtiiirucc  would  lead  us  to  think  it  probably 
meant  the  same  thing,  and  was  a  similar  formation.  This 
is  what  I  believe  it  is — nothing  more  nor  less  than  \&m- 
fiTi  (in  Welsh,  /ici/-''"'«)  =  summer-weaiher  or  sun-weather, 
the  O.  Ir.  p'n  (now  pon)  and  Welsh  /;;"//,  meaning 
weai/ter'm  general.  The  y  of  pn  being  aspirated,  would 
easily  disappear  in  composition,  just  as  it  has  disappeared 
from  i-iiiiAil  (like)  in  such  words  as  ylié-Aiiiûil,  jein- 
iiriiAiL,  7c.  The  shortening  of  a  rowel  is  common  in 
Irish  compounds,  cf.  ^pAiiriiiii  for  5l^o.■o-11u\l^  or  jpiti- 
mó^,  tiTHMm  for  im-i\éim,  7c.  The  slender  vowel  of 
hin  caused  the  cvol  be  caoI  in  Welsh,  so  we  have  hejin, 
but  in  Irish  the  first  syllable  ruled  the  second,  and  so  an 
A  was  inserte  1  for  leiCAii  le  leaèŵii  and  i-^m-in  became 
fam-Aiii. 

This,  I  hope,  is  a  more  ralional  and  consistent  expla- 
nation of  )-Am4in  than  the  old  one.  But  how  did  the  word 
come  to  mean  winier,  or  rather  November'!  I  believe 
that  bá  SjtimA  was  a  corruption  of  Ij  54iiinA  =  winter- 
day,  or  first  day  of  winter,  but  as  gimiiti  also  meant 
a  calf,  the  name  became  disused,  Tŵmain  also  gave  way 
to  i-Ami\At)  in  the  old  sense  of  summer,  and  while 
people  forgot  the  real  meaning  of  the  word,  a  sufficient 
memory  of  its  force  remained  still  to  connect  it  with 
\&vn,  and  when  the  word  was  written  i-*niuin  and 
fatriuin,  an  apparent  fitness  easily  suggested  the  expla- 
nation i-AW-fuin — or  the  fancied  etymology  may  have 
suggested  the  spelling  i-Aifi-um.

plain it,  the  English  won!  "excise,"  the  meaning  ought 
to  be,  "  may  you  escape  the  gauger."

What  is  -opie  ? 

(9)  Students  of  Keating  will  be  glaii  to  hear  that  the 
puzzling  word  bipA  (see  Three  Shafts,  vocabulary.)  is  yet 
spoken.  In  Colonsay,  according  10  Professor  MacKinnon, 
who  is  a  native  of  that  island,  if  a  stick  or  stone,  which 
ought  10  be  perpendicular,  inclines  in  any  liirection,  they 
say,  tha  a  bhara  an  rathad  so,  its  inclination  is  this  way 
(road).     In  Scotland,  rathad  \i  used  =  road,  never  bóthar.

c  Ú.  <1  gnicAc  pn  ope.  How  are  you?  Well,  healthy 
may  you  be.  May  you  be  alw.iys  so.  These  are  usual 
salutations.  Is  there  any  reason  for  supposing  that,  in 
the  last  phrase,  the  word  spoken  is  not  gnÁcAc  but 
conic  ?     The  pronunciatiOQ  is  certainly  cnÁc. 


(II)  Ceipim,  I  believe.  CÁpé  cinn,ceipini  (Co.  Cl.irf 
What  is  ceipini  ?  Possibly  part  of  ciceAp  ■oom,  -pei

with.  In  emj-eACC  is  also  used,  in  Arann,  =  at  once,

(13)  Sl-*t-  The  usual  meaning  of  gbAj- is  ^íí»,  ap- 
plied to  grass  or  other  things  naturally  green.  But  when 
used  of  the  hair  or  wool  of  animals,  it  means  ^ay,  as 
CApAll  stAf,  CAOpA  jLAf.  Uscd  of  we.aiher,  it  means 
chilly,  as,  li  j!.*!",  AmipeAp  jl-.^!"-  In  this  connection 
we  may  quote  an  instance  of  a  play  on  the  tw  i  meanings 
of  this  word.  One  day  a  Cork  priest  met  on  the  road  .i 
local  celebrity,  and,  after  the  usual  salutations,  said  :  i\

(14)  Our  folk-lore  readers  will  remember  many  inci- 
dents connected  with  the  black-hafted  knife,  fSi'*"  ẃub- 
copAÒ,  which  the  person  rescuing  a  friend  from  the 
bpui  jein,  or  fairy  residence,  should  take  with  him,  and 
Use  upon  fairy  enemies.  Instead  of  blood,  the  blade  was 
always  found  covered  with  a  slimy  ichor,  which  was  called 
in  Cork  5LÓCAC,  gen.  gtóí  ai  je.  In  Connemara,  jIaoc 
SbA]"  is  the  substance  into  which  wicked  people,  in  the 
folk  tales,  are  turned  by  supernatural  power — the  "green 
stone  "  of  Anglo-Irish  tales.  A  slimy  e.vudation,  some- 
times seen  in  the  spring-time  in  rich  pastures,  is  called  in 
Cork,  im  j-ocAip,  because  it  is  not  unlike  butter  in  coi;- 
sistency,  and  is  a  proof  of  the  richness,  j'ocAp,  of  the  Ian;. 
In  other  parts  of  the  county,  tlxse  e.\udations  are  pointed 
out  as  the  remains  of  fallen  stars  !  In  connection  with 
fairy  lore,  the  tradition  was,  that  a  changeling  whende.ni 
was  not  admitted  into  the  land  beyond  the  grave  with 
ordinary  mortals,  and  tales  of  the  exclusion  of  the  coppAn 
prie,  or  fairy  corpse,  might  still  be  collected  at  Munsier 
firesides. 


A  respected  correspondent,  SeAntiún,  suggests  that,  in 
many  cases,  the  present  a;iplication  of  the  ancient  Gaelic 
proverbs  might  be  given  by  those  who  collect  the  old 
sayings.  The  application  is  not  everywhere  the  same, 
and  often  is  very  far  from  the  literal  translation  of  the 
word.  Thus,  éipc  le  j-uAiin  nA  h-AbAnn  A'p  jeobAip 
bpeAc,  is  simply  our  curious  Gaelic  way  of  saying,  "  time 
will  tell."  .Again,  Leif;  me  cum  An  bonAij,  acc  nA  beig 
An  boüAC  cu^Am,  applies  to  people  who  "give  110  right 
and  take  no  wrong."  Ip  pupupDA  (see  yupuipDe  in  the 
Véip,  in  this  number)  puine  Aice  nA  m  mine  =  "the  rich 
can  be  generous."  We  shall  be  gl.ul  to  have  all  such  notes, 
or,  indeed,  notes  on  anything  that  has  appeared  in  the 
Journal.

TRANSLATION. 

1.  On  Friday  morning  we  were  wakened  up  (/«/.sitting), 
and  my  heart  within  refused  it,  going  into  it  (the  busi- 
ness) ;  it  is  Boyle,  of  Loughanure,  that  incited  us  to  go  ; 
we  made  the  journey,  and  not  without  retribution  it  went 
with  us.  We  took  to  the  oars  ;  but  it  was  not  clear  to  us 
(i.e.,  we  did  not  know  how)  to  make  steering  ;  there  was 
foam  and  spray  rising  on  us  from  beliind.  If  there  had 
been  a  knife  in  our  pockets  that  would  cut  the  ropes, 
the  wind  would  have  put  us  under  the  shelter  of  the 
mountains. 

2.  Patrick  Ban  O'Harley,  no  wonder  that  you  were 
heartbroken  about  your  fine,  handsome  son,  whose  like 
was  not  in  the  country  ;  it  was  not  want  of  food  or  dainty 
that  brought  your  son  into  that  boat.  It  is  his  house  that 
was  full  of  every  kind  of  lood.  There  was  meal,  and 
there  were  potatoes,  there  was  barley,  and  there  was  grain 
in  it  ;  fish  hung  on  high,  of  which  there  was  not  the  like 
in  the  land  ;  and  not  a  young  girl  in  that  place  that  did 
not  fall  in  love  with  him  ;  and  his  mother's  great  grief,  it 
does  not  leave  her  heart. 

3.  It  is  the  Black  Back  of  Owey,  the  Black  Back  with- 
out goodness  —how  damp  and  how  cold  is  my  bed  of  rest ! 
Oh,  Neill  Ban  O'Partey,  is  it  not  sad  for  me  how  you 
were  left,  with  a  great  boat's  crew  of  them  by  your  side  ! 
The  squall  came  and  overturned  the  boat,  and  our  crying 
and  lamenting  might  have  been  heard  in  Arran.  If 
Curry  had  been  in  that  boat,  or  Donogh  my  brother,  it 
was  no  danger  for  us  that  day  that  we  should  not  come  to 
land. 

4.  Many  a  cargo  of  potatoes  I  and  my  brother  brought 
from  Connaught,  and  from  Malin,  on  the  sea  that  waj

violent ;  danger  we  found  not  till  our  coming  to  the  Back 
of  Owey — my  ruin  and  my  sorrow  that  we  ever  came. 
We  were  eight  (of)  active,  strong  men  ;  alas  !  there  were 
enough  of  us  with  very  little  skill.  Had  it  been  pos- 
sible (?)  to  save  but  one  single  man  of  us  that  would  tell 
our  friends  what  had  befallen  us  ! 

Note. 
Peter  Walsh,  who  was  a  tailor  in  Ballinamore,  in  the 
County  of  Donegal,  about  fifty  years  ago,  was  the  author 
of  this  fine   song.     From   Sarah   Gallagher,   Breenagh, 
Glenswilly,  the  song  was  obtained  by  the  writer.

Translation. 

Mor  (')  to  you,  'CiA^,  Mor  and  Mary  to  you  !  Were 
you  at  the  Congress?  What  Congress?  The  Gaelic 
Congress.  I  was  not,  where  was  it  ?  In  Dubhn.  For 
what  ?  (')  I'o  preserve  (  )  the  Gaelic.  And  where  is 
the  Gaelic  going  that  it  is  a  necessity  to  preserve  it  ? 
It  is  going  out  of  the  world  fast.(*)  Yerra  !  what  is  it  that 
you  are  saying  ?  I  am  saying  that  the  Gaelic  is  going, 
and  that  unless  a  powerful  effort  is  inade  to  preserve  it, 
that  it  is  short  until  there  will  not  be  a  word  of  Gaelic 
spoken  in  Erin.  Indeed,  Dermot,  you  have  always  been 
queer. (5)  You  think  to  persuade  (lit.,  pnt  it  lyini;  on)  me 
that  the  people  of  Erin  will  soon  be  going  about  like 
"  dummies."  Who  said  the  like  of  that?  I  heard  you 
say  that  soon  there  would  not  be  a  word  of  speech  in 
Erin,  and  that  it  was  necessary  to  gither  a  Congress  in 
Dublin  in  or<ler  to  keep  a  hold  of  the  speech,  and  how 
could  people  without  speech  be  but  dumb?  I  did  not 
say(*)  that  there  would  soon  not  be  a  word  of  speech  in 
Erin,  but  I  said,  and  do  say,  that  soon  there  will  nut  be 
a  word  of  Gaelic  in  Erin.  And  is  not  G.aelic  speech  ? 
It  is,  but  there  is  speech  which  is  not  Gaelic.  What 
speech  is  that  ?  English,  for  instance.C)  Oh,  I  under- 
stand you  now.  You  are  afraid  that  the  language  uf  the 
country  wiU  change  from  Gaelic  to  English,  and  the  Con- 
gress was  gathered  to  put  a  check  to  that  change.  You 
have  put  your  finger  on  it  at  last.  Do  you  think  you  will 
succeed  ?  All  I  can  say  is,(*)  we  will  do  our  best.  Were 
there  many  at  the  Congress  ?  Crowds  !(°)  Who  was  in 
the  chair  ?     The  Lord  Mayor  of  the  city.     Who  were  the 

others  there?     They  were  there  from  all  sides 

many  otiier  e.Npert  "  Irishians "  from  west,  north  and 
south.  Look  here.  I  don't  understand  myself  what  use  it 
is  for  the  Gaelic  that  all  these  should  come  together  in 
that  way,  chat  a  while,  .and  then  go  home.  I  don't  see, 
you  understand,  any('°)  work  done  after  them.  Well, 
but(")  they  made  laws  and  rules,  and  put  a  bond  and 
obligation  on  themselves  to  carry  out  these  rules  in  future. 
It  is  easy  to  make  rules.  What  rules  did  they  arrange  ? 
Did  they  oblige  people  to  speak  Irish,  instead  of  English, 
in  their  ordinary  business  ?  That  was  the  very  rule  they 
laid  down  most  strictly.  That  everyone  should  speak 
Irish?  Undoubteilly  !  Whisper  here  to  me.  Dermot, 
did  they  speak  it  themselves  ?  Almost  every  man  that 
was  there  representing  the  Gaelic  League  made  his  pub- 
lic speech  in  Gaelic,  in  presence  of  the  ladies  and  gentle- 


men there.  Do  you  say  so?  (lit.,  do  ye  hear  ?)  'Tis 
true  for  me.  It  was  great  work.  I  don't  know  (  =  1 
wonder)  how  many  centuries  ago  it  is  since  the  like  was 
heard  in  Dublin  before,  and  I  should  like  to  know  what 
they  all  said.  You  have  only  to  send  for  the  paper,  and 
you  will  get  a  full  account('=)  of  the  story.  I  will  do  that; 
and  when  the  next  Congress  is  a-gathering,  it  will  not  be 
gathered  unknown  to  me.  I  am  glad  to  hear  you  say 
that.  Good-bye,  now.  Good  day  to  you.  (They 
separate. )

pen,  will  be  given  in  next  is^ue.]

In  reply  to  many  .ipplications,  I  regret  to  say  that  I 
cannot  send  copies  ■>(  the  Jcmr/ial  gratis  to  anyone.  It 
is  a  mistake  to  imagine,  as  many  seem  to  do.  that  the 
Journal  is  supported  by,  or  connected  with,  any  society 
whatsoever.  The  Gaelic  League,  indeed,  does  all  that  it 
can  to  induce  people  10  buy  the  Tournal,  but  I  have  no 
means  from  which  to  pay  the  expenses  of  priming 
and  publication  except  the  subscriptions  which  are  sent 
to  me. 

E.   O'G. 


Some  people  are  anxious  to  know  why  we  publish  folk- 
stories.  It  is  not  so  much  for  their  value  as  folk-lore, 
as  for  the  number  of  old  words,  not  to  be  found  in 
dictionaiies,  which  they  contain.  We  would  venture  10 
say  that  each  of  the  recent  issues  of  the  Journal  contains 
over  a  score  of  ancient  Gaelic  words  which  are  now  put  on 
record,  translated,  and  explained,  for  the  first  time.  It  is 
only  by  continuing  to  collect  in  this  w.iy  that  we  can 
obtain  the  materials  for  a  good  modern  Irish  dictionary — 
the  great  want  at  present. 


Articles  in  the  study  of  Irish  have  appeared  in  many 
influential  foreign  papers,  including  the  Catholic  Times  of 
Philadelphia,  the  Visitor  of  Providence,  Connecticut 
LaihoUc,    New   York    Republic,    New    Zealand     Tablet, 


The  monthlies  for  May  contains  at  least  two  articles  of 
great  interest  for  students  of  Irish  literature.  In  the 
Ne-w  Trelattd  Reviac,  Mr.  Jolm  MacNeill  speaks  of  the 
general  character  and  value  of  the  ancient  Gaelic  litera- 
ture, and  gives  some  good  specimens  with  translations. 
The  Most  Rev.  Dr.  Healy  íüshop  of  Clonfert,  publishes 
in  the  Irish  Ecclesiastical  Record  a  most  attractive 
paper  on  the  lives  of  the  Four  Masters,  and  of  their 
great  work  "for  the  glory  of  God  and  the  honour  of 
Erin." 


We  are  glad  to  see  our  old  Gaelic  friends,  the  ^iowal  of 
Brooklyn,  and  the  Echo  (Tnac  ablâ)  of  Boston,  as  full  of 
life  as  ever.  Although  they  differ  on  some  points,  they 
are  at  one  in  their  work  for  the  old  torgue,  and  both 
cordially  support  the  circulation  of  this  Journal  in 
America.  The  Echo  now  commences  its  fifth  volume 
with  renewed  courngr,  an  i  begins  a  new  series  of  Irish 
lessons,  drawn  up  by  Mr.  John  O'Daly 


The  native  language,  history,  music,  scenery,  tra- 
ditions, &r.,  &c,,  of  the  Highland  Gaels  find  an  exponent 
month  after  month,  in  the  Celtic  Monthly.  The  illus- 
trations are  numerous  and  attractive,  Aiac  Talla,  away 
in  Canada,  sends  out  its  eight  pages  of  Gaelic  every  week. 
In  a  recent  article  by  Rev.  Mr.  MacRuiy,  we  find  the 
JobbÁn  SJop  appears,  in  a  .Skye  legend,  as  Bohan  Saor, 
a  famous  cooper  of  tlie  misty  isle. 

We  omitted  to  notice,  some  time  ago,  a  very  interesting 

i  article  on   Old-Norse  Words  in   Gaelic,   contributed  by 

t  Mr.  W.  A.  Craigie  to  the  Archiv  for  Nordish  Filologi. 

It  i=  time  that   someone   acquainted   with  the  old  Norse 

should  examine  the  Icelandic  literature  with  an  eye  to  any 

'  vestiges  of  the  Nor;e  connection   with   Iieland.     What 

little   has   been  done  by   Halliday  and  Dr.   Todd  only 

makes  one    wish   for  more.     Among  the  words  given  by 

Mr.  Craigie  are  : — bat),  a  boat  ;  i'eóü,  a  sheet  (of  sail)  ; 

I  |\úm,   a  room  ;    lonn,    handle    of  oar  ;    pcuip,    helm  ; 

I  SapWA  or  5âpp4-D,  a  garden  ;  Iocs  (topci),  a  loft ;  cite, 

stern  of  boat;  bóiTO,   board;  cLobo.  (?  =  clu5),  tongs; 

ceAp,  block  ;  goliib,  fork ;  &c.,  &c. 

The  addresses  recently  presented  to  the  Archbishop  of 
Dublin,  on  the  occasion  of  his  visit  to  the  Ladies'  Univer- 
sity School,  Dublin,  included  an  address  in  Irish.  The 
address  was  beautifully  illuminated,  and  attracted  much 
attention.  At  the  concert,  which  followed,  'Sd  múipniti 
•oilii-  was  sung,  and  was  received  with  applause. 

.At  the  annual  concert  given  at  the  Schools  of  the  Con- 
vent of  Mercy,  Stradbally,  seveial  songs  were  sung  in  the 
native  language.  This  is  a  new  and  much-needed 
departure  in  school  concerts,  and  indeed  in  concerts 
generally  in  Iceland.  The  songs  were  (i)  <.\n  c-Ani  pit» 
Ó;  ("2)  CAiceAiii  &n  jliip  ;  (3I III0  lTlháife  ;^  (4)  <Jn 
•oibii\reAC  ;  (5)  Sniioince  aj\  et;onn.  The  credit  of  this 
is  largely  due  to  the  exertions  of  the  Rev.  Father  Hickey 
one  of  the  oldest  supporters  of  this  Journal. 

IRISH  CLASSES. 
The  Gaelic  League  Classes  in  Dublin,  Derry  and  Cork , 
continue  to  be  well  attended.  Many  clas-es  are  working 
through  the  country  in  connection  with  the  new  lessons 
in  Irish,  and  hundreds  of  Irish  speakers  have  learned  to 
[  read  Irish  within  the  past  few  months.  Back  numbers  of 
I  the  Gaelic  Journal,  i.e.,  any  number  published  before 
i  No,  48,  will  be  supplied  to  Gaelic  classes  at  half-price,

THE   GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


The  Irish  Societies  in  New  York,  Philadelphia  and 
Boston,  carry  on  their  classrs  vigorously.  As  for  the  new 
classes  in  Providence,  they  surpass  any  previous  efforts  to 
revive  the  study  of  Irisli,  cither  in  Ireland  or  abroad,  as 
the  classes  number  over  170  members.  The  classes  are 
taught  by  Mr.  O'Casey  and  Mr.  Henehan,  the  latter  being 
a  native  of  one  of  the  glens  to  the  west  i^f  Lougli  Mask. 
Irish  history,  music,  tradition,  study  of  place  and  family 
names — all  find  a  place  in  the  work  of  the  classes.  Father 
Ryan  may  congratulate  himself  in  the  result  of  his 
exertions. 

The  first  part  of  the  Easy  Lessons  in  Irish  will  be 
is.sued  in  book  form  in  a  few  weeks.

Marj'  is  going  down  to  the  meadow  with  a 
pitcher,  and  Nora  is  at  the  barn.  The 
grass  is  dry  and  heavy.  The  fresh  grass  is 
heavy  yet ;  the  dry  grass  is  not  heavy  now. 
There  is  dry  turf  in  the  barn.  Art  is  on 
the  road  now,  he  is  not  going  to  Kildare 
yet.  James  is  going  to  America,  and  Nora 
is  going  with  him.  I  am  not  going  with 
you  to  the  island.  The  salt-sea  (]'Áile)  is 
between  Ireland  and  America.  There  is  a 
long  road  between  Kildare  and  Derry. 
Mary  is  not  working  now,  tlie  spinning- 
wheel  is  old  and  broken  ;  the  work  is  heavy, 
and  Mary  is  not  strong.  William  is  not 
sick  now,  he  is  well  (and)  strong. 


EXERCISE   XXII. 

§  151.  The  pronunciation  of  the  digraphs,  as  indicated 
in  §  1^2,  may  be  followed  in  all  cases  ;  but  the  popular 
spoken  language,  in  some  cases,  retains  an  older  pronun- 
ciation. Thus,  10  is  now  pronounced  like  i  short  ;  as, 
pof  (lis),  knowledge  ;  lioj-  (/is),  a  fort ;  but  in  Liom  (/urn, 
/-yum),  wii/i  me,  as  usually  pronounced,  we  can  yet  hear 
the  older  pronunciation,  both  the  1  and  ihe  o  being 
sounded.  In  the  following  list  the  10  may  be  pronounced 
1  short  by  students  who  have  no  opportunity  of  hearing 
Irish  spoken.

§  153.  'Oiin,  a  fort,  means  usually  a  stone  building; 
biof,  a  mound  of  earth,  generally  of  circular  form. 
Sio-pa,  the  word  in  general  use  for  "  shop,"  is  borrowed 
from  the  English  word.

§  155.  The  large  fort  is  old;  the  other 
fort  is  not  old.  The  whole  field  is  green  ; 
and  the  hedge  is  not  green  yet.  Come  with 
me  to  Deny.  I  am  not  going  with  you  to 
Derry,  I  am  going  with  him  to  Granard. 
Leave  the  young  horse  on  the  road,  and 
come  with  me.  The  path  is  clean  (and) 
dry  :  there  is  water  on  the  road.  All  the 
road  is  not  clean.  Come  on  the  other  road. 
There  is  an  eagle  in  the  high  fort,  he  is 
large  and  beautiful. 

EXERCISE-  XXIII. 

g  156.  We  have  ^een  in  §§  75-78,  how  the  short  vowels 
are  lengthened  in  Munster  before  double  consonants. 
The  short  vowel-sounds  represented  by  the  digraphs  in 
§  132,  arc  lengthened  in  the  same  way  by  Munster 
speakers.     Thus  : — 

eA  is  pronounced  e-ou,  or  almost  you 
10  ,,  i-00  ,,  yoo 

41)  In  some  parts  of  Munster  all  these 
are  pronounced  like  (ei) ;  as  a 
rule,  however,  ui  is  pronounced 
mi,   that  is  (ee).

Shannon.  The  day  is  calm  now.  He  got 
a  letter  from  Mr.  O'Brien.  Brian  O'Ryan 
is  not  going  to  Tipperar^'  now  ;  he  is  going 
to  Roscommon.  The  big  boat  is  better 
than  the  other  boat. 

EXERCISE    XXVI. 

§  169.  We  have  now  to  speak  a  little 
more  in  detail,  of  a  few  of  the  consonantal 
sounds  which  we  have  not  yet  treated 
fully. 

§  170.    Sounds  of  c. 

In  the  very  beginning,  §  2,  we  stated 
that  0  is  sounded  like  the  English  k,  and  is 
never  soft  like  c  in  cell,  cess,  &c.  In  the 
phonetic  key  the  student  may  also  see — 


cm  5 
cein 


The  svmbu! 

sototds  likf 

i)t  the  word 

K 

k- 

looking 

k 

k 

liking 

This,  no  doubt,  will  appear  very  unmeaning  to 
many  of  our  students.  But  if  close  attention  be  paid  to 
the  pronunciation  of  the  two  words  "looking"  and 
"  liking,"  it  will  be  noticed  that  the  termination  -king  is 
not  pronounced  in  exactly  the  same  way  in  both.  The 
"  king  "  of  "  liking  "  is  "  k-ying  ;"  while  the  "  king "'  of 
"looking"  has  no  "y"  sound  after  the  k.  We  repre.sent 
the  k  of  "  looking  "  by  capital  K,  and  the  k  of  "  liking  " 
by  italic  k.  But  these  signs  will  not  be  always  needed, 
for,  in  most  words,  the  ordinary  k  will  convey  the  correct 
sound  to  the  reader.  To  give  some  familiar  exam|>les, 
we  in  Ireland  usually  pronounce  the  words  "car," 
"  card,"  &c.,  with  the  k  sound  ;  our  pronunciation  of  these 
words  might  be  represented  according  to  our  phonetic 
system  by  /faar  (^k-yaar),  /Jaard  (  =  k-yaard). 

§  171.  Then  to  apply  this  to  the  Irish 
alphabet,  we  may  say — 

Symbol 

c  broad  (see  §  8)  is  sounded  like  K 
c  slender     „  „  „    k 

§  172.  We  shall  have  no  difficulty  in  pronouncing  the 
K  or  c  broad  sound  except  before  the  sounds  represented 
by  our  phonetic  symbols  a,  aa  ;  e,  ae  ;  i,  ee.  It  is  only 
in  Ulster  that  the  sound  K  is  followed  by  aa  (the  sound 
given  in  Ulster  to  Á  or  01). 

§   173.    EXAMPLES: 

C    liROAD. 
The  wurd  sounds  like        in  English  ;    or,    key-word 

CA01  -ky  lucky  (Kee) 

cuing  -king  looking  (King) 

coi|\  -ker  looker  (Ker) 

cAon  -kaiu-  knock-ainy  (Kaen) 

cAill  -kail-  knock-allion  (Ka/) 


^  174.   C  SLENDER. 

-k)'  sticky  (kee) 

-king  liking  (king) 

-ker  sticker  (ker) 

cem  cane  caning  (kaen) 

ceẃt         cal  calton  (kal) 

§  175.  If  we  were  to  carry  out  strictly  our  phonetic 
scheme,  the  last  five  words  would  be  represented  by  /tee, 
/{•iiig,  /i'er,  /iaen,  ^al ;  but  the  key-words  which  we  have 
given  represent  to  us  in  Ireland  the  correct  sound  of  the 
above  words. 

§  176.  Here  we  may  remark,  as  many  of  our  students 
have  already  noticed  fcr  themselves,  that  the  italicised 
symbols,  k^  i/,  /,  ;;.  r,  /,  all  represent  sounds  which  are 
merely  a  rapid  pronunciation  of  ky,  dy,  ly,  ny,  ry,  ty. 
Thus,  words  involving  these  sounds  can  be  represented 
phonetically  in  two  ways. 
The  sound  of — 

cnmi   is  represented  by  X-ewn   or    k-yoon 
■onin  ,,  ,,      i/ewn     ,.     d-yoon 

lum  ,,  ,,      /ewn       ,     1-yoon 

niu|\  ,,  ,,       Kewr     ,,     n-yoor 

b|^e,^^'        ,,  ,,      bras      ,,     br-yass 

ceo.^*         ,,  ,,      /as        .,     t-yas

§  179.  A  tree  and  a  wood.  Do  not  lose 
the  young  brown  horse.  There  is  not  a 
wood  at  the  well  now.  Conn  O'Ouinn  is 
going  down  to  Kildare.  Put  the  wheel 
down  on  the  floor,  and  put  a  stool  at  the 
door.  Oaten  bread  (ŵ]iÁn  coi]ice)  is  strong 
and  wholesome.  The  barley  is  fresh  and 
green  now,  the  oats  is  long  and  heavy. 
There  is  no  barley  growing  on  the  cliff — 
the  cliff  is  bare,  and  there  is  no  tree  grow- 
ing  on  the  other  cliff.  There  are  oats  and 
barley  in  the  barn  now,  and  Niall  and 
Peter  are  working  in  the  barn.  Put  the 
oats  in  the  barn,  on  the  floor,  and  leave  a 
flail  at  the  door. 

EXERCISE  XXVII. 
§  180.  The  Verb  "To  Havl." 
There  is  no  verb  "  to  have  "  in  modern 
Irish.  The  want  is  supplied  thus  :  The 
sentence,  "  Con  has  a  horse,'  is  translated, 
"  There  is  a  horse  at  Conn."  The  same  con- 
struction is  found  in  Greek,  Latin,  and 
other  languages. 

Examples.

Conversing  with  us  every  hour,

My  goose,  my  crane,  my  cock. 

2.  Our  wise  man,  our  poet, 
Went  one  day  to  seek  spoil  ; 
Three  gnats  the  ollave  found. 

He  did  not  eat  them  all  in  one  feast. 

3.  He  gathered  the  full  of  his  five  fingers 
With  his  dun  claws,  the  wren  ; 

The  thrice  four  around  the  repast, 
Whence   a  wet,  deafening  shower  will 
come. 

4.  Ochone  !  sad  to  my  heart  is 

The  death  of  the  plover's  offspring  ; 
The  plover  after  the  death  of  her  two

Twelve  denizens  has  the  wren.

Hurra  !  stately  knight  of  Brian's  race  ! 
Knight  of  the  troops  with  bridles ! 
Child  not  sprung  from  weeds  (low  rank), 
But  from  the  very  midst  of  kings  who  gave  laws  and  rules' 
My  love,  the  child  that  sprang  not  to  maturity  all  at 

once, 
But  grew  seven  feet,  vigorous  and  together ; 
The  son  of  the  horseman  who  used  to  scourge  the 

thieves 
From  the  horse-leap  to  Mallow  of  the  fat  beeves. 

Hurra  !  &c. 
Behold  a  shiplo.ad  (coming)  to  us,  as  a  flood  through 

a  mountain, 
Of  beautiful  rich  wine,  and  no  grudge  for  us  after  it. 
Let  a  glass  and  a  score  be  filled  of  it  for  William — 
The  health  of  the  stately  knight  of  Brian's  race  ! 

Hurra  !  &c. 

There  is  not  a  child,  nor  a  withered  old  woman 
From  Bunratty  to  Monaster  Inch, 
That  is  not  springing  up  at  the  smell  of  the  wine. 
While  it  is  being  consumed  by  the  nobles  of  the  laud. 
Hurra  !  &c. 
Of  red  wines,  shiploads  I  and  of  nut-brown  (wines)  ! 
Pipes  of  brandy  !  methers  of  beer  ! 
Let   us  be  lasting  them  until  we  taste  them  to  the 

bottom  ! 
And  until  the  moonlight  hides  itself  in  our  shoes  !

TRANSLATION. 
CARROLL  BUIDHE  OF  THE  SONGS. 

Carroll  Buidhe  of  the  songs  was  a  poet.  He  was  one 
day  going  to  Ballycotton,  and  he  met  a  naau  named  foxy 
Tim  : 

C.  God  and  Mary  with  you,  Tim. 

T.  God  and  Mary  and  Patrick  with  you,  Carroll.  How 
far  is  your  journey,  Carroll  ? 

C.  Only  to  the  Caiteach,  Tim.  How  far  is  your  own 
journey  ? 

T.  Wisha,  only  eastwards  here  to  the  church  cross. 
We  will  be  cutting  down  corn  on  Monday  next, 
with  the  help  of  God,  and  I  am  goiug  east  to  see  could  I 
collect  a  body  of  reapers. 


C.  I  think  it  is  a  good  time.  The  corn  is  cut  down 
everj'where,  and  the  men  are  after  coming  home. 

T.  'Tis  true  for  you.  I  was  speaking  last  night  to  Tim 
Healy.  He  was  after  coming  home  from  Blarney.  He 
said  he  saw  you  there,  and  that  there  were  two  or  three 
there,  who  did  not  know  you,  and  that  one  of  them  asked 
another  "who  was  the  yellow  little  man."  You  per- 
ceived the  question,  and  you  had  the  first  of  the  answer 
in  this  way  : — 

"  I  am  yellow  Carroll  of  the  songs  ; 

I  could  play  a  piece  of  music  on  harp-strings  ; 
I  could  make  a  fine-comb  and  a  riddle  ; 
I  could  put  a  fibre  in  the  bottom  of  a  sieve. 
I  play  a  goal,  and  tighten  a  thong  in  my  shoe. 
But,  God  bless  my  hand  !  I  have  made  as  yet  but 
one  sieve." 

C.  That,  ha,  ha,  was  true  for  I'im.  We  do  always 
liave  great  fun  at  Blarney. 

T.  Look  here,  Carroll,  there  is  always  great  wonder 
on  myself  how  ye  make  this  poetry.  If  I  were  to  wear 
out  my  sense  with  it,  I  could  not  put  one  together. 

C.  Not  so,  Tim,  but  you  are  making  poetty  every  day 
of  ydur  life,  and  every  hour  of  the  day,  if  you  could 
perceive  it,  and  ]ilace  it  together. 

T.  You  are  a  funny  man,  Carroll  ;  I  did  not  make  one 
bit  of  poetry  ever,  and  neither  did  any  word  ever  come 
out  of  my  mouth  that  any  other  person  could  take  poetry 
out  of  it. 

C.  How  far  is  it  from  here  to  Ballycotton  ? 

T.  As  you  would  say  half  a  mile. 

C.  I'll  bet  you  a  quart  of  beer  that  you  will  have  a 
■oan  made  before  we  shall  be  at  Ballycotton. 

T.  Arra,  nonsense  !  I  confess,  Carroll,  that  I  tried, 
there  are  twenty  years  since,  to  compose  a  song  in  praise 
olShanagarry — "  Shanagarry  of  the  music,"  said  I,  and 
if  I  got  Ireland  I  could  not  go  further  on  it. 

C.  Will  you  lay  the  wager? 

T.  I  will,  and  welcome,  and  so  I  may,  you  will  have 
to  pay. 

C.  Wait  a  while.  But  let  us  see  what  young  Ned  is 
doing  over  the  way. 

T.  He  is  making  a  hedge  on  his  garden,  and  it  is  little 
good  for  him,  for  when  those  willows  wither,  the  goats 
will  be  able  to  get  through  them.  God  and  Mary  with 
you,  Ned  ! 

N.  God  and  Mary  and  Patrick  with  you,  Tim,  and  with 
you  also,  Carroll.  Have  you  any  news  ?  At  what  are 
you  shaking  your  head,  Tim  ? 

T.  I  am  shaking  my  head,  Ned,  because  that  fresh 
willow  is  a  bad  hedge. 

N.   It  can't  be  helped,  I  have  not  any  other. 

T.  Oh  I  stop,  man,  don't  put  the  withered  sapling  into 
the  hedge.  The  fresh  thing  is  bad  enough,  but  it  will 
do  the  business  for  a  while. 

C.  Come  along,  Tim,  that  I  may  get  my  quart  of  beer 
from  you. 

N.  For  what  reason,  Carroll,  are  you  to  get  a 
quart  of  beer  from  Tun  ? 

T.  A  bet,  if  you  please,  he  has  made  with  me,  that  I 
would  have  a  jd»  of  poetry  made  before  we  would  be 
both  in  Ballycotton — I  that  never  made  a  Mn  of  poetry, 
and  no  wonder! 

N.  I  am  afraid,  Carroll,  that  you  will  have  to  pay  this 
turn . 

C.  Come  along,  if  it  is,  and  have  your  share  of  the 
drink. 

N.  Perliaps  it  may  be  as  well  lor  me  (perhaps  it  was 
never  better  for  me).

T.  It  ii  true  for  you.  There  is  not  much  between 
hands  with  you. 

N.  Tim  has  not  a  great  estimate  on  my  work. 
T.  If  I  had  aliedge  to  make.  I  think  I  would  put  black 
thorn  or  white  thorn  into  it.  I  should  even  prefer  a  liush 
of  furze  to  that  willow.  But  what  is  this  Willi;im  Buckley 
is  doing  with  his  team  of  horses?  What  is  the  matter 
with  you  now,  William  ?     Is  your  plough  broken  ? 

W.  No,  Tim,  but  my  whippletree  isbroken,  and  I  am 
trying  to  put  a  gad  upon  it. 

T.  Stop  !  stop  !  William,  you  are  putting  it  on  the 
wrong  way.  Twist  the  gad  off  the  end  (pole)  of  the 
whippletree,  and  it  will  have  the  best  grip.  There  !  put 
a  knot  on  it  now." 

C.  Look,  Tim,  does  not  the  sea  loolc  beautiful  to-day. 
I  don't  know  whence  came  that  ship  yonder- 

T.  Slie  was  not  there  yesterday,  bee,  aroo,  Carroll,  is 
not  the  boat  far  from  the  stern  of  the  ship? 

C.   It  is,  Tim,  and  well  it  h.is  become  you,  the  ikiii  is 
finished  by  you,  and  my  quart  of  beer  won  by  me. 
T.  Is  it  mad  yoif  are,  Carroll — what  dan  ? 
C.  Listen  to  me.     There  is  not  long  since  you  said  to 
young  Ned  :  "  A  bad  hedge  is  the  green  willow." 

T.  I  said  so,  and  there  is  not  much  poetry  in  the 
willow. 

C,  Then  you  shouted  at  him  :  '' Don't  put  the  withered 
sapling  in  the  hedge." 

T.  And  where  is  the  poetry  in  that  much. 
C.  Have  patience.  You  then  said  to  William  Buckley, 
*' Twist  the  gad  over  the  enil  of  the  whippletree,"  and 
just  now  you  said  to  me,  "  How  far  the  boat  is  from  the 
stern  of  the  ship."  I  myself  never  made  a  better  dan  than 
it.      Look  — (he  quotes  the  bnes  again). 

T.  By  the  deer  !  Carroll,  there  are  no  bounds  to  you. 
And  it  was  out  of  my  own  mouih  every  word  of  it  come. 
You  have  won  the  bet  clean.  Come  ye  along  and  let  the 
drink  go  round.  Look  here,  Carroll,  I  should  think  that 
jump  was  rather  big  from  the  end  of  the  whippletree  of 
the  stern  of  the  ship. 

C.  It  was  you  that  gave  that  jump.  It  was  necessary 
for  me  to  follow  you. 

T.  Afnbossa  '.  you  have  scored  again.  There  is  no  use 
in  being  at  you. 


containing  the  "  Book  of  Clanranald."*  There  are  two 
books  of  the  name,  similar  in  the  character  of  their  con-

famous  in  the  whole  Gaelic  world  of  the  13th  century. 
.Successive  members  of  the  family  have  recorded  clan 
history  down  to  the  beginning  of  the  i8th  century,  and 
thus  in  pp.  14S-20S  we  have  a  rich  treat  of  what  ought  to 
be  regarded  as  the  best  classical  Highland  Gaelic.  This 
part  of  the  work  is  of  the  highest  historical  as  well  as 
literary  value.  The  poetic  contents  of  the  books  of  Clan- 
ranald are  various,  and  far  more  attractive  than  such  col- 
lections usually  are.  The  Fernaig  MS.  occupies  pp. 
1-137  ;  it  is  a  faithful  copy  of  a  MS.  written  in  a  rude, 
phonetic  fashion  in  16S8.  Towards  the  end  of  the 
volume,  pp.  475-523  are  devoted  to  a  collection  of  pro- 
verbs inade  by  Dr.  Cameron  as  a  supplement  to  Nichol- 
son's great  work.  Last,  but  by  no  means  least,  we  are 
given  a  number  of  Cameron's  lectures — literary,  historical, 
and  philological — which  show  that  Dr.  Cameron  had 
realized  the  truth — that  it  is  impossible  to  obtain  a  sure 
grasp  of  Highland  Gaelic  without  a  close  acquaintance 
with  the  older  Gaelic  of  the  sister  isle.  The  present 
volume  is,  I  believe,  the  most  valuable  that  has  ever 
been  published  in  the  interests  of  Scottish  Gaelic  ;  it 
throws  light  on  the  past  history  of  many  a  glen  and  dis- 
mantled fortress  ;  it  gives  to  the  world  some  gems  of 
Gaelic  thought,  and  affords  ample  material  for  future 
work . 


A  NEW  GAELIC   BOOK. 

Cóip  TTAilce  i\e  pep  •oo  i-getL — p.   240. 

Reliquicc  Celtics,  vol.  ii. — The  second  and  concluding 
volume  of  Dr.  Cameron's  unpublished  papers  is  a  volume 
of  absorbing  interest  for  all  students  of  Gaelic  literature. 
Like  the  first,  it  is  edited  by  Mr.  MacBain  and  the  Rev. 
Mr.  Kennedy,  and  forms  a  large  and  beautifully  printed 
volume  of  650  pages.  The  price  is  not  indicated.  Even 
our  own  large  MSS.  collections  in  Dublin  have  not,  to  my 
mind,  such  an  attraction  as  the  few  but  precious  frag- 
ments— for  many  of  them  are  very  small — which  are 
preserved  in  the  M.S.  department  of  the  Advocates' 
Library  in  Edmburgh.  Dr.  Cameron  transcribed  much 
of  the  Gaelic  there  preserved,  and  his  transcriptions  are 
here  published  in  full.  Thus,  ihe  Argyllshire  Turner 
MS.  .\iv.  is  given  in  pages  310-420.  (The  contents  are 
all  poetical,  and  almost  all  purely  Scottish,  e.xcept  the 
fine  iitmha  nam  bratkar  (page  333),  and  some  good 
Cuchullin  fragments,  and  some  proverbial  philosophy). 
Pages  420-474  contain  a  version  from  same  library  of  the 
"Sons  of  Usna,"  already  puhlished  in  the  Irische  Texti. 
But  by  far  the  most  valuable  part  is  that  (pp.   138-309) 


THE  ANCIENT  IRISH  DIVISION  OF  THE 
YEAR. 

(Continued.) 

Whilst  the  division  of  the  year  into  two  main  seasons 
prevailed  in  Erin  for  a  long  time — how  long  we  do  not 
know — it  is  quite  certain  that  the  sub-divisiou  into  four 
quarters  is  also  of  ancient  date,  and  was  known  in  pagan 
times.  The  fact  that  the  Welsh  have //íÎ/ and ^<niiz/^— our 
p<irii  and  jAtii — certainly  points  to  a  time  when  the  Celts 
were  one  people,  all  alike  dividing  their  year  into  SAM 
and  G.AM  or  SAM.A.S  and  GAMAS  ;  but  the  fact  that 
they  have  not  our  words  fur  autumn  and  spring  but 
others,  proves  as  certainly  that  the  sub-division  into  four 
seasons  came  later,  when  the  Gaedhil  and  Cymry  had 
separated,  and  had  become  two  nations. 

The  Iiish  name  {ox  autumn  or  harvest  is  pojriiay»,  and 
for  spring  eap)\AC.  Of  these  names  I  have  never  met 
with  any  adequate  explanation  ;  and  ii  anyone  his  rightly 
explained  them,  or  anticipated  what  I  am  going  to  say 
al)OUt  them,  I  am  not  aware  of  it.  I  think  I  cm  show 
that  the  words  themselves  bear  traces  of  their  late 
formation. 

Of  vogmAp  different  explanations  have  been  hazarded. 
O'Donovan  took  credit  for  suggesting  it  was  the  same  as 
the  Greek  'oinipa,  fruit-time.  Philologically,  nothing 
could  be  wilder  than  this  comparison  ;  but  he  quotes 
O'Clery's  Glossary  as  giving  another  origin;  "pogrndp 
.i.-poca  uiip  n-jAim,"  i.e. ,  foundation  of  the  months  of 
winter.  Now,  whether  O'CIery  himself,  or  some  older 
writer,  is  to  be  credited  with  this  guess,  whoever  started 
it  seems  to  have  got  nearer  the  truth  than  any  one  else  I 


'Clanranald  (in  Gaelic  Claim  RaghnjiU,  or  children  of 
Ragnall,  a  Scandinavian  chief).  In  the  same  way  is 
derived  the  family  name  MaeRaghnaill,  now  anglicised 
Magrannel,  Grannell,  or  Crangle,  and  often  (especially 
in  County  Longford)  changed  into  Reynolds.

THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


have  read  of,  and  without  doubt  had  a  faint  tradition  of 
the  real  meaning  of  the  word.  If  he  had  been  satisfied 
with  giving  yot&  JJiiii  as  the  solution,  without  dragging 
in  the  niif,  lie  would  have  been  still  nearer  the  truth,  but 
yet  at  a  considerable  distance  from  it.  In  the  first  place. 
It  must  lie  remembered  that  tiie  fûni,  |'ini|\d"ò,  or  sum- 
mer-half, was  reckoned  from  May  to  October  inclusive  ; 
and  the  Jim,  5enin\ejiẃ,  or  winter-half,  from  November 
to  .\pril  inclusive.  Later  on,  the  second  half  of  this 
l-Ampuw — including  Augu~t,  September  and  October — 
was  called  fogiiiwix.  The  fiist  of  August,  to  this  day,  is 
>till  considered  the  first  day  of  harvest.  But  why  was 
the  latter  half  of  the  summer  called  pojtiiAi\  ?  The  oldest 
forms  of  the  word  are  fogmuji  .ind  ^rogwniA^x.  Now,  to 
me  nothing  is  clearer  than  that  this  word  jrogAmap  is 
only  i:o-54m4i\,  for  iro-gûmpji,  and  means  simply  siio- 
winter.  In  -pAtripdu  and  5eimpeat)  the  aspirated  ■o  has 
not  been  pronounced  for  centuries  ;  and  so  the  former  is 
pronounced  and  sometimes  written  "j-âmpd,"anJ  the 
latter  "  geniiixe."  We  have  seen  that  jetmiveAD  was 
formed  from  a  primitive  ^Aim  or  ^etn  ;  but  from  54m  we 
should  have  expected  *  54iìi-)\atì>,  as  from  fain  we  have 
]-4mpi-ò.  Perh.Tps  there  was  a  ^.sm-pAT)  at  first  which 
was  displaced  by  the  collateral  form  ^eni-iAet).  If  this 
does  not  sufficiently  explain  the  jampA  in  *):o-5dm(ia, 
then  the  influence  of  the  broad  vowel  in  po-,  and  the 
aw  of  Leif  ill  le  Le.3cari  would  account  for  it.  As  to 
the  difference  between  po5*mi\A  and  pogdmâp,  the  trans- 
position of  a  vowel  in  the  last  part  of  a  trisyllable  is  an  ^ 
easy  matter  ;  besides  we  still  have  such  doulile  forms  as' 
5A■LA1^  and  jaLpa  (disease),  lolip  and  lolpÁ  (eagle), 
feompû  and  peomap  (room),  etc. 

The  prefix  po-  not  only  means  S!i6  (under,  near, 
towards),  but  is  identical  with  it.  For  it  has  been  shown 
— I  think  by  Zeuss — that  po  represents  a  prehistoric 
Celtic  *vo  or  *iw,  which  was  lor  an  original  *iij>i> — the  / 
between  two  vowels  regularly  disappearing  in  the  Celtic 
dialects.  This  iifo  is,  of  course,  identical  with  the  Greek 
'iiTró,  and  this  with  the  Latin  suò.  So  that  the  Irish  Celts 
who  at  first  looked  upon  the  harvest  months  is  part  of 
their  summer,  came  also  to  look  upon  them  as  the  '  sub- 
winter, '  the  near  ox  fore-ivinter.  This  explanation  is  not 
only  confirmed,  but,  to  my  mind,  completely  established 
by  a  Welsh  analogy.  One  of  the  Welsh  names  for 
autumn — though  not  exactly  ours,  as  said  lielore — is 
strikingly  parallel,  viz.,  Cynauaf,  which  is  clearly  for 
Cynt-gauaf—iiiA  winter,  from  cyntaf,  first  (in  compounds 
cynt  and  <>'«-),  and  gatiaf,  winter,  which  loses  the  g  in 
composition. 

Dr.  O'Donovan,  in  the  essay  already  quoted  from, 
speaking  of  the  old  Irish  divisions  ot  the  year,  says  : 
"  The  fact  seems  to  be  that  we  cannot  yet  determine  the 
season  with  which  the  pagan  Irish  year  commenced."  I 
do  not  know  if  O'Donovan  ever  gave  any  further  con- 
sideration to  the  point,  or  altered  his  mind  on  the  subject. 
He  ridiculed  Dr.  Charles  O'Conor  for  stating  his  belief 
that  the  old  Irish  year  commenced  with  May,  and  that 
the  se.-isons  went  in  the  order — pampŵẁ,  po  jtiiap,  jeim- 
pedT>,  eippjc  ;  but  it  was  chiefly  because  of  O'Conor's 
forced  (and,  indeed,  impossible)  dcrivatitm  of  eappòc 
(spring),  from  '  lip-pícû,"  which  he  rendered  "last 
quarter."  Now,  though  this  derivation  of  edl^p.^c  will 
certainly  not  do,  D.-.  O'Conor  had  probably  other  evidence 
for  his  main  statement ;  and  even  if  it  was  only  asumiise, 
it  was  a  very  shrewd  one.  In  itsrif,  there  was  nothing  at 
all  strange  or  irrational  in  thinking  that  the  pagan  Irish 
began  not  only  their  summer  with  May-day,  but  also 
their  new  year.  The  ancient  Romans  began  their  year 
with  the   first   of  March,  and  the  Jews  began  their  civil 


year  with  Tishri,  in  autumn,  somewhere  about  the 
equinox  ;  whilst  the  religious  year,  to  them  more  impor- 
tant, began  with  Nisan,  abont  the  time  of  the  spring 
equinox.  If  the  ancient  Irish,  who  began  their  summer 
on  May-day,  and  made  it  a  great  festival,  began  also  their 
year  on  that  day — if  .May-day  was  their  new-year's  day — 
nothing  would  lie  more  naHiial.,  Are  there  any  facts  to 
prove  it  ? 

Dr.  Charles  O  Conor  certainly  liid  not  give  any  con- 
vincing argument  on  the  subject.  .Mr.  David  Comyn,  in 
his  eilition  of  the  t1loiCf;nim4péd  ptin,  has  also  hazarded 
the  statement  that  May-day  was  the  Old  Irish  "y"'"" '''<' 
V Any'  but  he  gives  no  evidence.  Now,  whatever  other 
facts  or  presumptions  may  exist  in  favour  of  this  view — 
and  I  dare  s.ay  there  are  many — I  will  bing  forward  heie 
two  bits  of  evidence  which  seem  to  indicate  that  the 
ancient  Irish  year  began  on  Maydiy  ;  but  which  seem 
10  have  been  stiangely  overlooked. 

The  first  is  the  well-known  ijuotation  from  Cormac's 
Glossary  on  the  explanation  of  beûlcdine,  the  Irish 
name  for  May-day — a  quotation  of  which  hitherto  we  do 
not  seem  to  have  made  the  most.  It  is  as  follows  :  — 
"  beLLciiine  1.  biLLcene  1.  ceme  biL  1.  cenie  poininec 
1.  •DA  ceni"o  ponimecŵ  00  giiírii'  ha  üpŵioe  con  cincec- 
Laib  iiiópAib  poppa  conibepcip  "a  cecpie  ecapp*  up 
ceomunnatb  ceca  bbiA-oriiS,"  i.e.,  Belltaine  =  billtene  = 
tfiie  \i\\—fire  of  hick,  i.e.,  two  fires  of  luck  the  druids  used 
to  mnI;e\ox\  May-day],  with  great  incantations  pronounced 
over  theniy  and  they  used  to  drive  the  cattle  between  them 
against  the  plagues  of  the  year.  The  cattle  then  were 
driven  between  the  two  fires  as  a  safeguard  against  the 
plagues  of  the  year.  What  year  ?  Evidently  the  ensuing 
year — ihe  coming  year.  Neither  was  it  fur  three  months, 
nor  six  months  ;  there  was  only  one  La  beẃlc&ine  in  the 
whole  year,  and  on  this  day  cattle  were  driven  between 
two  fires  as  a  safeguard  against  all  the  plagues  of  the 
ensuing  twelve  months.  If  this  is  not  conclusive,  it  at 
least  proves  that  for  some  purposes  tá  l)e<iLcaine  was 
considered  the  opening  day  of  a  new  year.* 

*  beûlcaine.  I  believe  the  explanation  of  this  word, 
given  above  from  Cormac's  Glossary,  is  substantially  the 
true  one.  '  Baal-tine,'  or  the  fire  of  Baal,  will  have  to  be 
given  up.  Theie  is  no  good  authority  to  prove  that  any 
god,  T'.él  or  Baal,  was  ever  worshipped  in  ancient  Ireland. 
The  oldest  form  of  the  name  is  belcene,  or  beLctne; 
the  e  in  the  first  syllable  is  short,  and  there  is  generally 
only  one  b.  The  first  word,  however,  is  not  any  adjective 
meaning  ^<;ö(?;  but  more  probably  a  form  ofb4b  =  luck, 
now  bail,  douhtless  allied  to  the  English  weal,  Lat.  val- 
in  valor,  Gr.  j3eX  in  jScXtIup,  &c.  beX-cene,  now  beiL- 
CAine,  is  therefore  the  "  luck  fire,"  and  La  beALcaine  = 
the  day  of  the  luck-fire.  Many  words  have  double  forms, 
especially  in  composition,  as  h&n,  ben  (woman)  ;  t>a5, 
T)e5  (good)  ;  5^111,  gem  (winter),  &c.  As  for  the  May- 
day fires.  Dr.  O'lJonovan  himself  witnessed  them  in 
County  Dublin  in  his  own  time,  and  they  are  still  kindled 
ill  the  Highlands,  and  for  the  same  old  superstitious 
purposes. 

The  next  piece  of  evidence  I  have  to  offer  is  in  con- 
nection with  e<spp<sè,  the  Irish  name  for  spring ;  a  word 
which  I  have  put  first  at  the  head  of  this  paper,  but 
which  I  deal  with  last.  All  the  explanations  I  have  as 
yel  seen  or  heard  of  this  word  are  unsatisfactory.  Hitherto 
classical  analogies  have  been  the  only  ones  sought  for. 
The  Greek  êap,  dap,  rip,  spring,  has  been  very  tempting, 
and  loo  many  have  lightly  followed  O'Donovan  in  making 
this  equation.  Cormac's  Glossary  connected  eappac  with 
the  Latin  vir,  spring.  No  doubt  the  Greek  fjp  and  the 
Latin  ver  are  identical  ;  the  former  was  probably  ■çy}p  at

first,  till  it  lost  the  digamma.  But  when  roots  which 
began  with  the  digamma  in  Gieek  are  common  to  Latin 
and  Irish,  in  the  lormer  of  these  they  begin  with  i',  and 
in  the  latter  with  y.  Such  are  ofKos  (for  foii-os),  Latin 
Tinuni,  O.  Ir.  p'n  (now  yion),  Eng.  wine;  ei/iocri,  Doric 
ftVari,  L;Uin  viginti,  Ir.  yice  ,  Eng.  twenty;  olcra,  Lat. 
vidi,  O.  L  vecai\  (now  i:eâ-OÄi\).  hng.  wit,  wot.  If  the 
Irish  for  spring  were  the  same  as  the  Greel;  and  Latin,  it 
should  therefore  be  "yep;"  but  it  was  neither  yéi\  nor 
yepoic,  it  W.13  eyixAC  (now  eâppac),  with  never  a  sign  of 
an  y.  The  real  Irish  analogue  of  Jjp  and  ver  is  yep  (now 
yeup,  grass),  which  most  probably  was  the  original  mean- 
ing of  the  classical  words  — the  bright  new  gras^  being  one 
of  the  most  striking  signs  of  spring.  Another  flaw  in 
the  comparison  of  epyAc  uiih  T}p  and  ver  is  that  the  Irish 
word  has  a  double  p ;  whilst  there  is  but  one  in  the 
classical  words,  and  the  ending  of  eypii-  is  leit  quite 
unaccounted  for. 

But  whilst  the  Aryan  tongues  have,  of  course,  many 
words  in  common,  there  are  also  differences.  It  does  not 
follow  that  d'eiy  Irl^Il  word  must  have  a  classical  analogy, 
or,  at  least,  it  does  not  follow  that  such  analogies  must 
have  the  same  meaiiing.  5<^"',  ts  we  have  seen,  has  such 
analogies,  but  yjm  has  not  ;  the  Greek  for  summer, 
Bépoí,  and  the  Latin  aistas,  show  no  connection  with  our 
word,  nor  wiih  each  other.  Another  explanation  of 
edppac  was  offered  by  the  late  (,'anon  Bourke  in  one  of 
his  numerous  specidations.  He  suggested  the  Irish  word 
éipge,  to  rise,  as  the  root  of  ecippjc.  This  has  the 
analogy  of  the  English  spring  (noun  and  verb)  in  its 
favour  ;  but  though  there  are  infinitives  and  verb  ils  in 
Irish  ending  in  -oic,  as  ^Lûo'ój.c,  cec\ntK\c,  etc.,  the 
infinitive  of  the  Irish  for  rise  never  ended  in  -AC  ;  it  was 
épge  (now  éipje)  for  eyy-yije,  with  long  e  and  one  p  ; 
whilst  eppac  has  two  r'l  and  a  short  e. 

If  May  began  the  year,  then  the  spring  season — 
February,  March,  April  -formed  the  end  of  the  year. 
What  if  eŵyyac  should  mean  the  end  ?  This,  I  believe, 
is  the  true  expl.ination— a  natural,  unforced,  Irish  expla- 
nation, satisfactory  in  itself,  and  giving  further  proof  that 
the  Irish  pagan  year  began  with  May.  I  consider  eyj\-Ac, 
then,  a  plain  derivative  of  eyy,  an  end  or  conclusion  ; 
later,  eâpp.  The  simple  woid  eipp,  which  has  well- 
known  Teutonic  analogies,  is,  I  think,  obsolete,  *  now  in 
Ireland  ;  but  it  is  found  in  some  late  writers.  In  a  poem 
written  about  1660,  by  O'Clery  (one  ol  the  IV.  MM.), 
and  given  in  O'Curry's  MS.  Materials  (p.  564),  the 
second  half  of  the  12th  stanza  runs  : — 

"  mate  Le<jm  nap  Lágoûij  ■do  call 
'S  gup  Ápxjaij  eapp  ■oom  anáil." 
That  is  ;    "  Glad  am  I  thy  fame  has  not  diiiiinished,  and 
that  my  last  breath  (lit.  end  of  my  breath)  has  extolled  it. " 
And  in  another  poem  by  the  same  writer,  and  quoted  in 
the  same  work  (p.  569),  occur  the  lines  : — 

"  üéna  An  c-incpeaca'ó  'otije 
O  cúy  50  h-eipp  c'  aimytpe." 

That  is  :  "  Make  thou  all  due  criticism  of  tliy  life  from 
beginning  to  end."  Dr.  O'Brien,  in  his  Irish  Dictionary 
(1760),  gives  eapp,  with  a  couple  of  phrases  to  illustrate 
it :  "'ouine  a  n-eapp  a  aoiye,''  1.  a  man  at  the  end  of  his 
life,  in  the  decline  of  his  years  ;  "  a  n-eapp  na  cipe,"  1.  in 
the  end  of  the  country.     Examples  of  epp  from  ancient 

*  Not  quite  obsolete  ;  it  is  yet  used  in  some  parts  of 
S.  W.  Munster,  and  one  phrase,  which  includes  the  word 
[in  the  form  lopp]  ó  lopp  lae  50  la,  has  been  already 
printed  in  this  Journal. — E.  O'G. 


writers  are  still  more  common  ;  but  I  need  not  give  more 
here. 

Why  eappac  and  not  eapp  ?  In  many  nouns  the  Irish 
suffix  -ac  forms  aiigmentatives.  Thus,  from  coy  we  have 
coyac,  beginning,  (the  exact  counterpart  of  eappac)  ; 
irom  cul,  culac  (hill)  ;  from  ceap,  ceapac  (plot  of 
ground) ;  from  bpar,  bpacac  (a  flag)  ;  etc.  So  eappac 
from  eapp:  whilst  eapi\  would  mean  an  exact  restricted 
end,  eappac  would  mean  a  fuller,  more  estended  end. 

'■  But  end  of  what  ?"  it  maybe  asked.  Cappac  with 
this  meaning  would  be  merely  a  relative  word,  and  how 
C'luld  it  come  to  have  an  absolute  and  definite  meaning 
of  itself?  Well,  nothing  is  commoner  in  Irish — and, 
indeed,  in  other  hinguages  too — than  for  a  merely  re- 
lative term  to  acquire  after  a  time,  generally  by  abbrevia- 
tion, an  absolute  sense.  So  now  we  use  uaccap  (cream) 
for  uaccap  bainne  (upper  milk).  Inn),  shrovetide. 
Welsh  Ynyd,  for  Initiiim  Qitadragesimae — if  it  is  not  for 
Initiumjejunii,  etc.,  etc.  Perhaps  eappac  at  first  w.is  for 
eappac  ir\  garni,  end  of  winter — for  our  Irish  spring  has 
a  repute  for  chilliness  as  many  of  our  native  proverbs 
testify.  I  believe,  however,  that  what  was  meant  was 
eappac  na  bLiaima  =  the  year's  end,  and  I  am  inclined 
to  think  that  this  expression — "  eappac  nabLiawna  " — so 
often  met  with  in  the  Annals  and  other  writings,  though, 
no  doubt,  in  Christian  times  it  was  u.sed  in  the  sense  of 
"the  spring  of  the  year,''  meant  at  first  "  the  end  of 
the  year  ;  but  that  when  the  new  mode  of  reckoning 
was  introduced  with  Christianity,  the  old  name  eappac 
was  still  ret.ained  for  the  season,  whilst  in  ils  origin.al 
and  true  sense,  its  ]ilace  was  taken  by  such  words  as 
yoipceann,  oeipeati,  t)iait),  etc.  This  mode  of  naming 
a  season  is,  moreover,  quite  agreeable  to  our  Irish 
custom  ;  witness  tni-o,  already  given,  and  the  well-known 
popular  way  of  naming  the  months 'first-month-of-spring,' 
'  mid-month-of-spring,'  *end-montli-of-spring, '  etc. 

I  have  come  to  the  conclusion  then  that  Dr.  Charles 
O'Conor  arrived  at  with  regard  to  the  year  and  ils 
seasons — that  May  begnn  the  year,  that  the  seasons  in 
their  order  were  yaiiipa-o,  yogmap,  geimpea-ô,  eappac, 
that  eappac  was  the  last  of  the  seasons,  and  the  end  of 
the  year.  I  have  come  to  this  conclusion,  however,  more 
easily,  more  directly,  and,  I  hope,  niore  reasonably  than 
Dr.  <  )'Conor.  Yet,  my  object  in  this  paper  was  not  so 
much  archaeological  as  etymological.  Iri.sh  etymology  is 
a^  yet  almost  an  unbroken  field— I  mean  real,  modern, 
scientific  etymology — but,  perhaps,  the  slight  excursion  I 
have  here  made,  will  give  some  idea  of  the  important 
be.aring  the  subject  may  have  on  many  poinis  of  Irish 
history  and  archaeology.

NOTES   AND   QUERIES. 

(15)  (See  N.  and  Q.  2)  Mr.  Finian  Lynch  states  that 
in  Kerry  aig  an  n-oopuy,  atg  an  ucobap,  ap  an  ■oci'p  are 
always  said,  eclipsis  lieing  always  practised  in  such 
cases. 

(16)  (See  N.  and  Q.  4)  A  passage  in  O'Begley's  or 
MacCurlin's  Liictionary,  s.v.  live,  would  go  to  show  that 
the  Western  phrase  (in-on')  =  in  iiimiie.  "  That  ship  is  so 
old,  she  can't  live  long  at  sea.  Acá  an  long  ú-o  coiriiyean 
agay  yoin,  nac  yana  biay  p  anmnme  na  mapa 
Tjyulang."  We  have  here  exactly  the  same  sense  as  in 
the  Western  (in-on')  and  the  Donegal  'ninith.  Again,  in

they  came  and  filled  the  two  -.hips,  so  that  they  were 
about  to  sink  (on  the  point  of  sinljing,  or  "fit  "  to  sinl;). 
This  Intter  sense  agree-  exactly  with  the  use  of  the  phrase 
of  the  I.eitrim  man,  quoted  in  \he  Journal.  Vol.  IV.,  p.  69. 
The  above  are  both  good  authorities,  and  spell  tlie  phrase 
ex.ictly  in  the  same  way.  I  have  not  the  -ilightest  doubt 
that  in  itinn'ie  is  the  correct  spelling  of  the  Connaught 
(in-on').  —J.  n.  LiOYD.

French /0/'«/,  as  I  had  the  pleasure  of  pointing  out  to 
Dr.  Hyde,  in  his  "  Love  Songs  of  Connaught."  If  I  am

nŵoi,  ■oeic  ;  words  like  peói\)-.a,  etc. ;  and  in  popular 
usage  the  article  (i^  ukmc  a'  I'ceul)  before  many  con- 
sonants.— C  O'f.

it  is  obviously  a  curse,  and  cannot  be  the  equivalent  of 
"  May  you  escape  the  ganger."  which  surely  must  be  a 
good  wish  in  Ireland.  I  do  not  think  we  have  excise 
here.  T  thought  first  it  might  be  exercise  in  the  sense  of 
feat,  trick  or  ilced — '■  M.Ty  the  deed  or  trick  not  rise  with 
you,"  i.e.,  "not  succeed  with  you" — but  I  am  most 
inclined  to  believe  that,  in  spite  of  the  strange  spelling, 
"  Act'AWi-  "  is  only  an  Iri.sh  form  of  success,  with  the 
initial  s  lost  after  the  article.  If  this  be  the  word,  a  more 
analogical  spelling  would  be  l-oc)-AiDAf  or  focpAOj- ;  and 
"  iiAl\  éiiMJit)  Au  c-i-oci-AWAy  LeAC  "  would  mean,  Rlay 
success  not  rise  wilh  you.  or  attend  you,  another  form  of  the 
familiar  •opoc.^Au  o^xc  I  The  article  would  be  used  after 
the  Irish  analogy;  cf.  "  50  i\Aib  ah  c-áj  ope!" — May 
you  have  (tlie)  luck  !  The  initial  ■(  would  disappear  in 
pronunci.ition  after  the  analogy  of  feininines  like  An 
c-i-LÁiiire,  health ;  ah  c-|-Aoip|-e,  freedom,  7c.  The 
word  cannot  date  to  early  Christian  times,  like  a  good 
many  clas-^ical  words,  or  we  should  not  have  the  s  sound 
of  the  c  in  cess.  It  may  lie  Norman-French,  like  AbAncup 
'yXucV)  =  aveiitiire ;  bAiicAirce  (profit)  =  7'a«í'n;'í'  (íox avati- 
ta..e),  7c.,  dating  from  a  time  when  as  yet  the  final  s  in 
siicccs  was  pronounced  ;  but  most  likely  it  is  very  modern, 
and  a  direct  loan  from  the  English  success.  Seeing  that 
we  have  so  many  pure  Irish  words  for  the  same  tiling,  the 
loan  is,  of  course,  quite  unnecessary. — C.   O'Ç.
