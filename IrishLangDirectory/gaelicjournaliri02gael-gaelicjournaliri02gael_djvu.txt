FOLK  LORE. 

The  following  is  a  first  instalment  of  one 
among  many  legends  I  collected  within  the 
last  few  years  in  the  Arann  Islands.  The 
narrator,  John  Folan,  is  a  fisherman  in  Inip 
ttleoùAin,  who  cannot  speak  English,  as 
indeed  scarcely  any  of  the  inhabitants  of 
that  island  are  able  to  do.  There  is  still  a 
rich  store  of  folk-lore  in  our  western  islands, 
but  it  is  almost  entirely  confined  to  the  ex- 
clusively Irish-speaking  population.

ELEMENTARY  LESSONS  IN  IRISH. 

Not  knowing  exactly,  in  our  diminished 
size,  how  much  of  our  space  we  could 
afford  for  the  elementary  lessons,  as  in 
No.  24  of  the  Journal,  we  have  taken  for 
this  issue  two  lessons  from  the  "  Teacher's 
Journal.'1  One  of  them  we  have  selected 
specially,  in  order  that  the  poetical  exercise 
in  it  may  be  preserved.  It  is  a  very  popu- 
lar song  in  the  county  of  Waterford,  and 
was  composed  by  James  Power,  known  as 
SéAiiui]"  ha  Spoil,  James  of  the  Nose — Incus 
a  non  lucendo — he  having  only  the  rudi- 
ments of  that  appendage  to  his  face.  He 
was  one  of  the  smaller  gentry  of  the  county 
of  Waterford  ;  and  he  soon  got  rid  of  his 
small  property  in  law  and  dissipation  ; 
living  afterwards  altogether  on  the  bounty 
of  his  friends.  Of  course,  he  lost  his  self- 
respect,  too  ;  and  it  is  curious  with  what 
humour  he  describes  his  own  debasement. 
CAifleÁn  cuauac,  called  in  English,  Four- 
mile-water,  is  a  village  about  four  miles 
south  of  Clonmel.  The  parish  is  named 
from  the  village  ;  and  in  this  parish  is  the 
townland  of JfÁig-nA-ngAbAf.,  the  "village 
of  the  goats,''  where  Power  lived  while  he 
had  a  house  of  his  own.  The  piece  tells  its 
own  tale.  It  begins  :  Lá  o'á  fAbAf  in]- 
An  5-cAifleÁn  cuauac.  "O'a,  from  tie,  of, 
and  a,  those  which,  shows  that  he  was  often 
in  Four-mile  water,  in  the  ale-house,  of 
course.  Had  he  been  there  but  once,  or 
seldom,  he  would  have  said  LÁ  "oo  broeAf. 

Cup  ttiAtpfjj,  inquiring  for,  i.e.,  calling 
out  for  the  focman's  son  to  come  forth  and 
fight.  'Paoiü'  cuAinim,  an  abbreviation  of 
fAoi  cuai|\iiii  no  j'LÁince,  towards  your 
health;  lorn  me,  I  stripped  off;  took  off 
my  coat ;  gave  myself  up  to  the  drink. 
j^AC  le  T)oiiuiAc,  every  other  Sunday  ;  jac 


"Oon'm  ac,  every  Sunday.  In  the  first  stanza, 
'11  a  finje,  means  sitting,  and  in  third,  the 
words  mean  standing.  CÁi|ic,  a  card,  is 
pronounced  long  in  East  Munster ;  but 
cAi|ir,  when  it  means  a  title  or  chart,  is 
short  :  ní  peAt>Ap  mé  f  at>  1110  cAipce  aiji  ah 
pAoJAÌ,  I  do  not  know  the  length  of  my 
bond  or  chart  of  the  world.  SpunifAf, 
wealth,  is  not  in  dictionaries  ;  the  reader 
may  recollect  it  in  the  opening  lines  of 
510U.A  An  -tVniAnÁm.  bÁ]i  Ivube  or  full.

5l'Aii,  is  shot  ;  buclA,  a  buckle  ;  pút)A]i, 
powder.  UácIa,  a  tackle,  is  an  uncommon 
word.  "Oeoc,  gen.  'oije,  a  drink,  in  the  lan- 
guage of  topers,  is  beer  or  ale.  piob  or 
piop,  gen.  pibe  or  pipe,  pipes.

One  day  I  was  in  Four-mile-water, 
Looking  for  the  foeman's  son. 
I  met  a  maiden  seated  on  a  form, 
Near  a  great  house  beside  the  road. 


She  accosted  me  mildly,  discreetly, 

"  Gentleman,  pray  sit  awhile, 

And  drink  with  me  without  thirst  to  your 

good  health. 
Whence  have  you  come,  and  where  is  your 

business  ?" 

II. 
"  In  Graig-na-ngabhar  I  did  reside, 
Until  I  became  reckless  with  the  drink ; 
Every  other  Sunday  I  went  to  church, 
Expecting  some  small  help  from  the  Crown. 
I  was  genteel  when  I  went  to  town, 
And  a  pattern  of  discretion  in  the  ale-house  ; 
And  I  would  get  a  fair  maid  without  using 

violence, 
But  that  she  thought  my  nose  much  too 

lone. 


"A  good  smith  I  am — I  could  shape  a  horse- 
nail, 

Or  a  first-rate  spade  that  would  make  a 
digging. 

I  would  plough  a  furrow  on  hill  or  plain, 

And  a  stack  I  would  set  up  in  harvest. 

Amongst  the  children  I  would  be  sportive, 

And  with  Sir  John  Jones  I  would  quaff  a 
bumper. 

A  game  of  chess  I  would  play  with  skill, 

Or  five  cards  with  John  O'Bro. 

IV. 
"  A  skilful  tradesman,  I  would  fix  a  hoop  on, 
And  dance  to  music  of  any  kind. 
If  I  found  two  who  had  plenty  of  wealth, 
I  could  instruct  them  well  in  cheating. 
For  my  darling  I  would  make  a  coat  with 

a  hoop  in  it, 
And  a  yellow  buckle  fix  in  her  shoe. 
I  would  finish  frieze  the  best  in  the  country. 
And  sure  that  is  creditable  for  a  rake  such 

as  I. 

V. 
"  If  I  had  these  things,  shot  and  powder, 
A  brace  of  hens  I  would  kill  on  the  moor  ; 
A  hare  from  the  bush  could  not  escape  my 

hound, 
On  a  dewy  morn  as  I  walked  the  road. 
I  would  angle  with  a  pliant  rod — 
A  noose  at  its  top,  or  a  line  of  horse-hair. 
On  a  fleet,  slender  steed  I  could  ride  well, 
And  well  too  could  I  teach  a  fair  one. 


THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


"  These  are  fair  accomplishments  according 
to  my  notions  ; 

But  I  could  do  things  I  have  not  mentioned 
yet. 

With  tuneful  fingers  I  do  touch  the  harp- 
strings, 

And  make  the  pipes  sweet  music  speak. 

But  too  many  trades — and  he  who  has  them, 

'Tis  his  to  be  always  scant  of  wealth  ; 

•My  bosom's  darling,  do  not  abandon  me, 

Give  me  a  mug  of  ale  or  glass  in  my  hand."

(Additional    Remarks.) 

SéAiiiup  iu\  p|\óii. 

If,  as  somebody  has  said,  our  greatest 
interest  should  be  to  learn  what  kind  of  life 
people  lived  in  Ireland,  we  must  be  content 
with  scanty  information  in  respect  of  those 
who  lived  a  century  and  a-half  since.  One 
anecdote  of  Séŵtnuf  is  that  on  a  visit  to  a 
kinsman,  CAiiiorm  jeAnncAC  ó  jleŵiin  iu\ 
1i-iiix>pe  (jeanncAC,  pug-nosed),  a  horse  was 
saddled  for  him  for  a  day's  hunting.  Com- 
ing out  to  mount  the  steed,  he  caught  its 
tail  and  examined  it  very  closely.  The 
host,  in  surprise,  asked  what  was  the  nature 
of  his  examination  ;  to  which  the  guest 
replied  :

"  the  teeth  of  a  gift-horse  are  not  examined." 
We  have  seen  that  'Oonnco.'ó  Kuat>  was  a 
very  great  lip-nationalist,  though  not  above 
bartering  his  religion  for  a  clerk's  salary. 
SévMrmp,  too,  for  a  consideration,  went  to 
church,  though  it  is  said  that  cursing  the 
memory  of  Colonel  James  Roche,  in  the 
graveyard  of  Churchtown,  he  split  the  tomb- 
stone over  him.  He  composed  a  few  lines 
of  rhyme  over  the  grave,  too  :

Below  under  the  earth  of  this  flag  the  really  mean  fellow 

lies, 
That  swam  the  Shannon  under  a  glass  head,  and  no  fear 
of  ilrowning  upon  him. 

Coarse  flag  bind  and  press  firmly 
On  the  wicked  reproachful— and  bruise  his  bones  ; 
For  fear  that  he  may  go  to  swim  into  the  Suir, 
The  man — the  destroyer  of  the  plain  of  Banba  is 
under  you. 

Colonel  James  Roche,  of  Glyn,  in  the 
county  of  Watefford,  between  Carrick-on- 
Suir  and  Clonmel,  is  buried  in  Churchtovvn, 
adjoining  the  townland  of  Glyn.  From  him 
I  suppose  Roche's  Point,  near  Derry,  has 
its  name.  He  was  one  of  the  Fermoy 
Roches,  a  family  that  nearly  all  fell  fighting 
for  the  Stuarts.  John  Roche,  the  Happy, 
lived  at  Tourin,  in  the  county  of  Waterford, 
near  Cappoquin.  Of  his  five  sons,  two  sur- 
vived the  wars  of  1641,  and  their  property 
being  confiscated  by  Cromwell,  they  joined 
Charles  II.  in  exile,  and  shared  their  poor 
pay  with  him.  One  of  the  two  brothers 
died  in  Holland  of  his  wounds,  and  his  son 
was  James  Roche.  Charles  II.,  on  his 
restoration,  ignored  the  Roches,  and  James 
Roche  joined  William  of  Orange,  in  whose 
army  he  rose  to  the  rank  of  colonel. 
General  Kirke,  sent  to  relieve  Derry,  was 
so  discouraged  at  the  obstacles  in  the  Foyle, 
that  he  would  have  sailed  away  had  he 
not  been  prevailed  upon  to  remain  by 
Colonel  Roche,  who  undertook  to  swim  to 
Derry  with  despatches.  His  jaw-bone  was 
broken  and  three  bullets  lodged  in  his  body 
on  his  way  in  ;  but  he  succeeded,  and  went 
back  again  to  the  fleet,  but  so  weak  that  for 
days  he  was  kept  alive  by  milk  poured  down 
his  throat.  He  was  not  treated  much  better 
by  his  adopted  party  than  by  those  he  had 
left.  At  any  rate,  he  was  High  Sheriff  of 
the  county  of  Waterford  in  1714,  in  which 
year  he  announced  the  accession  of  George  I. 
at  Dungarvan  and  Carrick-on-Suir.  He 
died  in  1722,  and  SéAmup  ma  y\\ór\  per- 
petrated the  lines  above  quoted  on  his  grave. 


SéAmup  had  heard  that  the  swimming  feat 
was  on  the  Shannon,  and  that  Roche  had 
on  a  glass  mask  which  enabled  him  to 
breathe  under  the  water.  Churchtown  is 
on  the  banks  of  the  Suir,  into  which 
SéAtnuj-  feared  the  deceased  colonel  would 
swim.  How  badly  we  do  things  in  Ireland  ! 
O'Daly  having  occasion  to  mention  Glyn, 
in  "  The  Poets  and  Poetry  of  Munster," 
vol.  i.,  p.  156,  said  it  was  a  "small  village 
situated  on  the  banks  of  the  Suir,  midway 
between  the  towns  of  Carrick  and  Clonmel. 
An  annual  fair  is  held  there  on  the  twenty- 
eighth  of  May.  The  Suir  runs  direct 
through  the  village."  There  is  no  village. 
It  is  a  fine  townland,  all  on  the  right  bank 
of  the  Suir ;  and  the  fair  was  held  on 
Ascension  Da)'.  If  it  were  worth  mention- 
ing these  things  at  all,  he  should  take  care 
to  be  accurate.  The  book  was  reprinted  a 
couple  of  years  ago,  and  the  note  has  been 
kept  intact  for  the  future  readers  of  Irish 
topography.  So  are  inaccuracies  per- 
petuated until  they  are  regarded  as  matters 
of  history.

THE  SOUNDS  AND  LETTERS  OF 
THE  IRISH  LANGUAGE.

XI. 

L  and  11. 

We  have  judged  it  expedient  to  interrupt 
the  regular  course  of  our  remarks  on  the 
diphthongs,  and  to  anticipate  those  on  cer- 
tain of  the  consonants.  Our  reasons  for 
doing  so  are,  that  in  no  grammar  that  we 
know  are  these  consonants  fully  treated  of, 
or  a  sufficient  number  of  definite  rules  given 
for  their  correct  use,  that  in  most  parts  of 
Ireland  at  present  where  Irish  is  spoken 
these  consonants  are  used  loosely  and  often 
erroneously,  and  that  we  have  been  re- 
quested to  furnish  a  fairly  full  treatise  on 
them.  The  consonants  to  which  we  allude 
are  t  and  11,  single  and  double.  These, 
along  with  m  and  y,  belong  to  the  class 
usually  called  liquids,  t  and  11  being  further 
termed  lingua-palatals,  and  11  and  1111  lin- 
gua-dentals, the  teeth  and  tongue  being  the 
principal  organs  used  in  pronouncing  the 
latter,  and  the  tongue  and  foremost  part  of 
the  palate  the  former.  11  is  a  nasal  lingual, 
I  a  dental  or  palatal  lingual.  The  Welsh 
//  has  nothing  in  common  with  the  Irish  11, 
though  the  Spanish  //  is  the  Irish  11  slender. 
With  these  preliminary  observations  we 
shall  proceed  to  consider  the  separate 
sounds  of  these  letters. 

Every  consonant  in  Irish,  except  y,  has 
four  sounds,  viz.,  the  simple-broad,  the  sim- 
ple-slender,   the   aspirated-broad    and    the 


*niMgmûj\,  heavenly,  from  nUAlg,  heaven. 


THE   GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


aspirated  slender.  The  aspirated  sounds  of 
all  consonants,  except  I,  11  and  ]\,  are  ex- 
pressed in  modern  Irish  orthography  by 
placing  a  dot  over  them,  or  by  writing  a  h 
after  them.  Thus,  be  An,  a  wife  ;  A  bean, 
pronounced  ah  van,  his  wife.  In  the  oldest 
manuscripts  there  is  a  variety  of  signs  of 
aspiration  ;  all  the  consonants,  including  11 
and  ]\,  but  excluding  b,  -o  and  5,  are  written 
on  certain  occasions  with  aspiration  marks. 
But  in  modern  Irish  printed  books  and 
manuscripts  t  and  11,  even  when  their  pro- 
nunciation is  changed  in  accordance  with 
the  rules  of  aspiration,  have  no  such  marks 
over  them.  It  would  be  well  if  they  had, 
as  it  would  tend  much  to  simplify  Irish 
pronunciation.  But  in  the  south-east  of 
Ireland,  and  indeed  through  the  greater 
part  of  Munster,  Leinster  and  East  Ulster, 
the  distinction  of  the  different  sounds  of  I 
and  11  has  been  in  great  part  lost,  and  even 
in  Roscommon  and  Mayo  it  is  being  ne- 
glected by  those  of  the  rising  generation 
who  still  speak  the  native  tongue.  It  is 
well  preserved  in  Clare, Galway,  West  Mayo, 
West  Donegal,  the  Hebrides  and  the 
Western  Highlands.  It  is,  therefore,  of  im- 
portance to  signalize  these  distinctions  be- 
fore they  are  lost  altogether.  We  shall  first 
take  the  liquid  b  into  consideration. 

L,  like  other  consonants,  has  four  sounds, 
two  simple  and  two  aspirated.  As  these 
latter,  however,  are  not  represented  by  any 
special  mark,  the  simple  sounds  have  been 
variously  denominated  thick  and  liquid, 
while  those  corresponding  to  the  aspirated 
sounds  of  other  consonants  have  been 
called  hard.  We  shall  adopt  the  terms 
thick  and  hard  respectively,  and  classify  the 
sound  of  the  letter  b  as  follows  : — 

L,  thick-broad,  as  in  lÁ,  a  day  ;  bobbd,  a 
wall ;  I,  thick-slender,  as  in  leA.b«\ji,  a  book  ; 
|.\\iblije,  neglect  ;  I,  hard-broad,  mo  lÁ,  my 
day ;  pÁt,  a  fence  ;  I,  hard-slender,  be*\c, 
with  thee  ;  eile,  other.  The  sound  of  i, 
thick-broad,  has  no  equivalent  in  English, 
and  to  obtain  a  similar  sound  in  other  lan- 
guages we  must  travel  as  far  as  those  of  the 
Sclavonic  family.  The  hard  I  of  these  in 
Russian  and  Polish  corresponds  closely  to 
the  thick-broad  I  of  the  Irish.  It  is  formed 
by  spreading  the  tongue  and  pressing  its 


point  against  the  inside  of  the  upper 
teeth.  The  thick-slender  b  has  the  tongue 
also  pressed  against  the  teeth,  followed 
by  the  sound  of  the  consonantal  y. 
This  very  much  resembles  the  /  mouillé  of 
the  southern  French,  the  gli  of  the  Italians, 
and  the  Spanish  //.  The  English  //  in 
million  is  too  hard,  the  tongue  being  too 
high  in  the  mouth  to  express  it,  but  it  ap- 
proaches to  the  Irish  sound.  The  hard- 
broad  sound  comes  near  the  English  /,  but 
is  not  quite  so  hard,  the  tongue  being  nearer 
the  root  of  the  teeth.  The  hard-slender  t 
does  not  exist  in  English,  but  the  //  in  mill 
comes  near  it.  The  distinction  between  the 
thick  and  hard  sounds  is,  that  in  the  former 
the  tongue  is  spread  against  the  teeth,  while 
in  the  latter  it  touches  the  fore  part  of  the 
palate  just  behind  the  root  of  the  upper 
teeth.  The  distinction  between  the  broad 
and  slender  sound  is,  that  in  the  former  the 
consonant  is  immediately  followed  by  a  very 
short  it  sound,  while  in  the  latter  there  is  a 
very  short  y  sound.  These  sounds  are  so 
short  as  to  be  scarcely  perceptible. 

b  THICK-BROAD. 

This  sound  occurs — 1st.  At  the  beginning 
of  words  in  their  unaffected  or  radical  form 
when  it  is  followed  by  a  broad  vowel.  Ex- 
amples, aii  lÁ,  the  day;  lu<xp,  swiftness; 
Iaj,  weak.  2nd.  In  all  such  situations, 
when  followed  by  a  broad  vowel,  as  those 
in  which  other  consonants  would  be  eclipsed, 
as  beip  an  IáIîti,  with  the  hand  ;  5  «mi  ah  Ion, 
without  the  provision.  3rd.  When  doubled 
in  the  body  of  a  word  before  or  after  a  broad 
vowel,  as  cAbbóro,  a  wrangling  ;  pobtÁw, 
pAbbÁm,  wholesome,  healthful.  4th.  Before 
a  broad  vowel,  in  the  beginning  or  body  of 
a  word,  when  immediately  preceded  by  the 
consonants,  t>,  c,  p,  or  followed  by  n,  c  or  n, 
as,  T>buc,  close  ;  cbo.ee,  pleasure  ;  clu,  a 
pair  of  tongs  ;  pbÁn,  in  good  health  ;  pbac,  a 
rod  ;  eẃpbÁn,  unhealthy.  5th.  When  doubled 
at  the  end  of  a  word,  after  a  broad  vowel 
as  b<.\lb,  a  member  ;  cobb,  a  hazel.  6th.  In 
the  body  of  a  word  after  n  or  nn,  before  a 
broad  vowel,  as  conntac,  stubble  ;  bŵnnlẃiii, 
a  handle  ;  -oiintup,  knotted  figwort.  7th. 
"Ob  in  the  body  of  a  word  is  pronounced  as 
bb,  as  cot>i<YÒ,  sleep.

I  THICK-SLENDER. 

This  sound  occurs — ist.  At  the  beginning 
of  radical  or  unaffected  words  when  fol- 
lowed by  a  slender  vowel,  as  leAiiilAcx), 
sweet  milk  ;  leAf,  luck,  benefit ;  Iiac,  grey  ; 
léme,  a  shirt.  2nd.  In  such  situations  as 
those  in  which  other  consonants  would  be 
eclipsed,  and  when  also  followed  by  a  slen- 
der vowel,  as  aj  An  I1A15,  at  the  physician  ; 
vÁ  leuiipnti,  if  I  should  leap.  Rules  3,  4, 
5  and  6  above  apply  also  to  I  thick-slender 
when  a  slender  vowel  is  substituted  for  a 
broad  one. 

Exception — The  preposition  te,  with  all 
itspronominal  compounds.has  not  the  thick, 
but  the  hard  sound  of  I. 

I   HARD-BROAD. 

ist.  I  at  the  beginning  of  words  in  all 
cases  in  which  a  mute  would  be  aspirated, 
and  in  which  it  is  followed  by  a  broad 
vowel,  acquires  the  hard-broad  sound.  Ex- 
amples, -ÓA  lÁ,  two  days ;  coj-  Lo]icÁin, 
Lawrence's  foot ;  aii  eilic  Iuac,  the  swift 
hind  ;  jac  inle  I05ÙA,  every  allowance  ;  a 
t-AbjiAi]-,  O  Laurence;  1110  Iao§,  my  calf ; 
t>o  loii-5  yé  iAt>,  he  burned  them  ;  t>'a  loc- 
■ouJA-ó,  blaming  him  ;  aii  té  a  UngeAp 
AfceAÓ  A1]\,  he  who  encroaches  on  him  ; 
feA]\b-Ui|-,  wormwood  ;  leAÙ-lÁn,  half  full  ; 
niop  loc  yé  é,  he  did  not  wound  him.  2nd. 
A  single  t  in  the  body  or  end  of  a  word  has 
the  hard-broad  sound  when  accompanied 
by  a  broad  vowel,  caIa,  a  swan  ;  cul,  a 
back  ;  cohaUac,  a  carcase  ;  cajIa,  fear. 
Except  when  preceded  by  11,  -o,  c  or  y,  in 
which  case  it  has  its  thick  sound.  3rd. 
When  single  I  is  preceded  or  followed  by 
b,  c,  y,  5,  111,  p,  ]i,  in  the  body  of  a  word,  it 
has  its  hard  sound,  as  also  before  or  after 
these  letters  aspirated,  as  blAp,  taste  ;  -cMIa, 
Scotland ;  cloi-ôe,  a  ditch  ;  eAlbA,  a  drove, 
herd  ;  yltot,  a  prince  ;  olc,  bad  ;  ulÓAbcÁn, 
an  owl  ;  çlAn,  clean  ;  iiiaInuic  for  niAlAipr, 
exchange  ;  pAlniAi|te,  a  rudder  ;  peAljAqie, 
a  hunter  ;  peAlb,  a  herd  ;  ploit>,  a  blanket ; 
ŵlpoi)ie,  a  glutton  ;  neAiiijlame,  unclean- 
liness. 

I   HAKD-SLENDER. 

When  t  is  preceded  or  followed  by  a 
slender  vowel,  it  has,  like  all  other  conso- 


nants, except  y,  a  slender  sound.  This 
slender  sound  is  hard,  ist,  in  all  the  cases 
comprised  under  the  foregoing  rules  for  I 
hard-broad,  substituting  a  slender  for  a 
broad  vowel  ;  and  2nd,  the  preposition 
lé,  with,  and  all  the  compounds  formed  by 
it  with  pronouns,  have  the  I  hard.  Ex- 
amples of  (1),  An  leAburò,  the  bed  ;  -oo  léig 
yé  é,  he  read  it ;  nio|i  lion  yé  ah  r-oigceAc, 
he  did  not  fill  the  vessel ;  luvle,  a  town  ; 
gle,  clear  ;  pl.e1.1p5,  strike  ;  -oo  pleur^  yé, 
he  struck ;  •Deipnii  nÁ|i  clip  yé  é,  I  say  he 
did  not  deceive  him  ;  (2),  lei]-  ah  hiiiaoi,  the 
woman's  ;  Linn,  with  us  ;  le  ■o'ACAip,  with 
thy  father  ;  leo-pAn,  with  them.  Remark- 
that  the  I  in  linn,  a  pool,  when  unaffected 
by  aspiration  is  thick-slender,  while  it  is 
slender-hard  in  latin,  with  us. 

Exception  to  the  rules  for  the  hard 
sounds  :  the  words  An,  the,  very,  Aen,  one, 
any,  reAn,  old,  do  not  change  I  initial  from 
thick  to  hard,  although  in  the  case  of  initial 
mutes,  except  c  and  v,  the  mutes  may  be 
aspirated  by  these  words  preceding  them. 

By  unaffected  consonantsabove  are  meant 
consonants  not  changed  in  pronunciation  by 
aspiration  or  eclipsis,  though  the  pronun- 
ciation may  be  modified  by  their  connection 
with  broad  or  slender  vowels,  as  the  case 
may  be,  or  by  preceding  or  following  c. 

The  Scotch  grammarians  apply  the  term 
plain  to  the  thick  or  liquid  sound  of  I,  and 
aspirated  to  its  hard  sound.  As  the  hard 
sound  is  often  heard  where  the  rules  of 
aspiration  would  not  apply,  we  prefer  the 
term  hard  to  aspirated.  Instead  of  the  term 
slender,  they  use  small. 

As  an  exercise  in  distinguishing  these 
sounds  of  I,  pronounce  a  Iaiii,  his  hand  ;  a 
lÁrii,  her  hand  ;  linn,  with  us  ;  lmn,a  pool  ; 
leAn  é,  follow  him  ;  leAn  yé  e,  he  followed 
him  ;  aIa,  a  swan  ;  Alluf,  sweat ;  cÁ  yá 
■olúc,  it  is  close  or  thick  ;  fgeAC  ■óiúi,  a 
close  briar  ;  IiaIIa,  a  wall  ;  bAUvò,  a  smell  ; 
bAÌAC,  a  clown  ;  beAlAC,  a  way ;  bAllAC, 
speckled  ;  cAill,  lose ;  CÁ1I,  reputation  ; 
cAtle,  a  bold  woman  ;  cAilleAC,  an  old 
woman  ;  cAicleAC,  husks  ;  All,  will,  plea- 
sure ;  Aill,  a  rock  ;  niAille  le,  along  with  ; 
iiiáIa,  a  bag  ;  111  aIa,  an  eyebrow  ;  hicaIa,  of 
honey  ;  hiaII,  late  ;  Aip  ah  iii-IaIIa,  on  the 
wall  ;  Aiiii|-  aii  m-bAile,  in  the  town  ;  hi'aiII,

Uib  An  •oo'n  cAppA.  The  CAppA  was  the  common  car  or

like  a  small  dray,  but  very  low,  and  had  a  rail  on  both 
sides  and  at  the  back  :  the  side-rails  sloped  down  to 
the  level  of  the  shaft  as  they  approached  the  f  ont, 
where  there  was  no  rail.  The  wheels  of  this  primi- 
tive conveyance  were  made  fast  to  the  axle,  which 
was  of  timber,  and  turned  with  them.  Uibin  was  the 
name  for  the  iron  bands  or  loops  in  which  the  axle

to  the  shaft.

signification,  and  is  used  to  mean  appendages  to  anything. 
It  means  here  some  appendage  of  the  plough,  and  very 
likely  the  side-plate,  for  they  say,  "  Cuip  Aip  iApbp  é," 
when  they  mean  to  turn  the  plough  with  the  side-plate 
down.  ÜÁ  iAplip  aca  Ann  :  cá  yé  m<sp  lApbip  ajac,  are 
expressions  used  with  reference  to  one  who  is  a  useless

THE   GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


Note.— This  air,  together  with  the  words,  was  taken 
down  from  the  singing  of  a  peasant.  It  would  appear  to 
be  composed  in  the  modern  key  of  D  minor  ;  but  upon 
examination  it  will  be  found  to  vary  in  some  particulars 
from  that  key  ;  especially  in  having  the  "  flat  seventh" 
throughout,  which  is  a  marked  characteristic  of  many  of 
our  Irish  airs. 

To  those  whose  knowledge  is  confined  to  modern 
music,  the  Irish  melodies  have  always  presented  great 
difficulties,  and  many  of  our  finest  airs  have  been  spoiled 
in  the  endeavour  to  strain  them  to  the  exigencies  of  the 
modern  scale.  Dr.  \V.  K,  Sullivan,  in  his  admirable  in- 
troduction to  O'Curry's  "  Manners  and  Customs,"  has 
shown  that  Irish  music  was  composed  according  to  a 
gapped  quinquegrade  scale,  obtained,  as  he  explains, 
from  a  circle  of  fifths  ;  and  that,  in  many  instances,  the 
airs  were  constructed  in  the  old  "Church  Tones,"  which 
were  themselves  founded  on  the  quinquegrade  scale.  The 
gapped  scale  was  one  in  which  the  semitones  of  the  dia- 
tonic scale  were  omitted;  and  "  so  strongly  impressed," 
says  Dr.  S.,  "  is  the  character  of  the  gapped  scale  in 
genuine  Irish  music,  that  in  those  airs  moving  in  the 
Church  tones  one  or  both  of  the  semitones  are  omitted." 
And  again  :  "The  omission  of  the  semitones  stamps  all 
such  airs  with  a  peculiar  colour,  which  we  at  once  recog- 
nise as  characteristic  of  Irish  melodies." 

Speaking  of  the  scale  or  key  of  D,  of  the  quinquegrade 
series,  Dr.  Sullivan  says  :  "  It  would  correspond  to  the 
first  authentic  Church  tone  in  D,  in  which  the  third  and 
sixth  would  be  omitted  ;"  and  that  "  when  the  omitted 
third  and  sixth  are  introduced  into  airs  constructed  origi- 
nally in  the  gapped  scale  (which  has  neither  a  third  nor 
sixth),  but  now  played  upon  instruments  tuned  according 
to  the  ordinary  diatonic  scale,  the  key  seems  to  corre- 
spond to  our  modern  minor  key."  In  another  place  he 
says  :  "A  great  many  Irish  melodies  have  been  composed 
in  this  key  (the  gapped,  or  diatonic  quinquegrade  scale  of 
D),  and  are  so  very  peculiar  and  different  from  our  modern 
music,  that  they  have  not  yet  found  their  way  among 
modern  musicians."  The  above  is  evidently  one  of  this 
numerous  class  of  Irish  airs  ;  and  those  who  are  accctts- 
tomed  to  Gregorian  or  Church  music  will  at  once  per- 
ceive the  strong  likeness  that  exists  between  it  and  the 
first  of  the  Church  tones  which  is  in  the  key  of  D.

TO    THE    READERS    OF    THE 

GAELIC  JOURNAL. 
The  Conscript  Fathers  once  passed  a  re- 
solution thanking  a  general  whose  army 
was  annihilated,  because  he  had  not  de- 
spaired of  the  Republic.  Whether  there 
are  among  you  any  who  had  not  given  over 
the  Gaelic  Journal  as  dead  I  do  not  know  ; 
but  had  you  known  what  difficulties  and  ob- 
stacles the  small  staff  of  the  Journal  had  to 
contend  with,  it  would  require  a  faith  equal 
to  that  of  the  Roman  Senators  after  Cannae, 
to  expect  that  the  first  number  of  the  third 
volume  should  ever  see  the  light ;  and  these 
difficulties  were  put  in  our  path  equally 
by  friends  and  those  who  are  not  friends. 

In  November,  1857,  I  was  looking  over 
some  books  in  O'Daly's  shop  in  Anglesea- 
street,  when  a  gentleman  came  into  the 
shop.  He  and  O'Daly  had  a  long  discourse 
about  Irish  books,  &c,  and  during  this  dis- 
course O'Daly  made  a  grievous  complaint 
against  Professor  O'Curry — or  as  he  called 
him,  Curry — for  obstructing  the  Council  of 
the  Ossianic  Society  in  their  work.  The 
gentleman  was  William  Smith  O'Brien,  and 
he  must  have  left  Anglcsea-street  that  day 
under  the  impression  that  it  would  be  well 
to  have  O'Curry  out  of  any  movement  per- 
taining to  the  Irish  language.  Such,  cer- 
tainly, was  my  impression  ;  and  years 
passed  over  before  I  had  learned  the  true 
state  of  affairs  in  the  Ossianic  Society.  The 
fact  is,  I  believe,  that  Professor  O'Curry  was 
the  only  person  who  clearly  perceived  how 
things  were  managed  at  the  time,  and  that 
he  tried  to  check  the  abuses  he  saw  ;  hence, 
it  was  necessary  to  give  him  a  bad  name. 


O'Daly  had  a  better  opportunity  than  any 
other  man  in  Ireland  of  meeting  Irish 
scholars  and  whispering  into  their  ears  ; 
and  he  turned  this  opportunity  to  account. 
He  was  the  publisher  of  the  Ossianic 
Society's  works,  and  he  was  the  honorary 
secretary  of  the  Society  ;  and  it  is  said  he 
took  advantage  of  his  position  to  suggest 
to  the  men  of  substance  in  the  Society  that 
they  were  drifting  into  debt,  and  that  they 
(the  men  of  substance)  would  be  the  parties 
liable  for  this  debt,  &c,  &c.  At  any  rate, 
the  Society  was  smashed,  and  O'Daly,  in 
payment  of  his  bill,  as  publisher,  got  the 
works  of  the  Society  at  a  low  figure. 

History  repeats  itself.  Before  the  Gaelic 
Journal  was  started,  the  Gaelic  Union  was 
more  than  a  hundred  pounds  in  debt,  of 
which  debt  nobody  now  in  the  Union  was 
aware.  The  debt  was  more  than  doubled 
in  a  short  time,  and  persons  with  oppor- 
tunities even  better  than  O'Daly's  have 
kept  on,  up  to  this  date,  whispering,  as  in 
the  old  times,  that  the  members  of  the 
Gaelic  Union  who  had  anything  to  lose 
would  be  mulcted  for  those  liabilities.  Still, 
the  Council  of  the  Union  toiled  on,  trusting 
that  the  friends  of  the  Irish  language  would 
enable  them  to  fulfil  their  obligations  to  all. 
And  now  those  who  predicted  bankruptcy 
for  them  will  be  glad  to  learn  that  a  few 
members  of  the  Council  of  the  Union  have 
wiped  out  these  heavy  liabilities,  and  that 
the  Union  does  not  at  present  owe  a  shilling. 
Would  it  be  too  much  to  hope  that  the  false 
prophets  may  likewise  desist  from  whisper- 
ings calculated  not  only  to  throw  discredit 
on  the  Union,  but  also  to  injure  individual

members  of  it  ?  It  is  said,  for  instance,  that 
some  transactions,  which  took  place  before 
the  secession,  have  been  commented  upon, 
as  if  done  by  the  members  of  the  present 
Gaelic  Union,  though,  like  the  debts  trans- 
ferred to  them,  they  know  no  more  about 
these  transactions  than  the  man  in  the  moon. 
I  had  intended  to  enter  into  details  of  the 
things  alluded  to  above,  giving  dates  and 
names,  but  two  articles  that  have  lately 
appeared  in  print  require  an  answer  in  this 
issue  of  the  Journal,  and  our  space  is 
limited.  Moreover,  I  hope  before  very- 
long  to  lay  before  the  public  in  another 
shape  a  brief  account  of  the  movement  for 
the  cultivation  of  the  Irish  language  since 
its  inception.  Even  in  this  paper  some  of 
the  incidents  in  this  movement  must  be 
told  in  order  to  set  the  Gaelic  Union  right, 
especially  before  the  young  generation  who 
are  learning  our  language,  and  whom  the 
said  articles  are  calculated  to  mislead. 
One  of  these  articles,  which  appears  in  the 
Irish  Ecclesiastical  Record  for  the  present 
month,  July,  is  from  the  pen  of  the  Rev. 
Father  Yorke,  M.R.I. A.,  and  is  headed,  "  Is 
the  Irish  Language  worth  Preserving?" 
The  members  of  the  Gaelic  Union  are,  of 
course,  at  one  with  the  rev.  writer  in  answer- 
ing this  query  in  the  affirmative,  and  in 
deprecating  the  apathy  of  our  people,  who 
are  looking  with  folded  arms  on  the  lan- 
guage of  their  fathers  dying  before  them. 
Father  Yorke  is  a  zealous  member  of  the 
"  Society  for  the  Preservation  of  the  Irish 
Language,"  and  his  zeal  has  unwittingly 
made  him  unjust  to  the  Gaelic  Union,  to 
which  he  makes  not  even  a  passing  allusion, 
but  whose  work  he  sets  down  to  the  credit 
of  the  other  "  Society."  He  alleges  that  the 
"  Society,"  by  diplomacy  and  pressure,  in- 
duced the  "  Commissioners  of  the  so-called 
National  Education  to  grant  certain  con- 
cessions in  the  way  of  teaching  Irish  in  the 
primary  schools."  Now,  the  facts  are  these. 
At  the  Congress  of  National  Teachers  in 
1874,  there  was  a  memorial  unanimously 
adopted  by  the  teachers,  praying  the 
Commissioners  to  grant  these  and  other 
concessions.  The  resolution  adopting  the 
memorial  was  moved  by  the  present  Mayor 
of  Kilkenny,  Mr.  P.  M.  Egan,  and  seconded 


by  the  late  Mr.  Peter  Fleming,  of  Killarney. 
Through  the  exertions  especially  of  four 
National  Teachers,  the  late  Mr.  Peter 
Fleming, of  Killarney;  Mr.  Lynch, of Cahir, 
a  Member  of  the  Council  of  the  Gaelic 
Union  ;  'Mr.  Payne,  of  Bandon,  and  the 
Editor  of  the  Gaelic  Journal,  this  memorial 
was  signed  by  five  Bishops  of  the  southern 
province,  and  by  over  eighty  managers  of 
National  Schools.  A  remark  made  by  the 
late  Irish  Secretary  at  Belfast  induced  the 
teachers  to  put  the  memorial  in  abeyance, 
and  wait  for  a  more  favourable  time.  In  1877 
the  Society  for  the  Preservation  of  the  Irish 
Language  was  got  up,  the  memorial,  with 
its  signatures,  was  handed  over  to  the 
Council  of  the  Society,  and  formed  the 
nucleus  of  the  monster  memorial  that  was 
afterwards  presented  to  the  Commissioners 
of  National  Education.  It  was  the  Editor 
of  the  Gaelic  Journal  wrote  the  teachers' 
memorial,  and  arranged  with  Messrs.  Egan 
and  Fleming  that  they  should  see  to  it  in 
Congress,  and  at  every  Congress  since  he 
has  personally  or  by  writing  taken  an  active 
part  with  his  fellow-teachers  in  renewing 
their  application  for  these  concessions. 

It  was  especially  by  the  exertions  of 
those  who  afterwards  became  the  Gaelic 
Union,  that  the  great  memorial  was  made 
a  success — so  far  as  it  was  a  success.  And 
it  was  they  who  instructed  those  members 
who  spoke  for  the  Irish  language  in  Parlia- 
ment. It  was  they  that  supplied  Mr. 
O'Connor  Power  with  the  materials  of  his 
great  speech,  and  it  need  hardly  be  stated 
that  the  other  great  speeches  we  have  heard 
on  the  subject  were  made  chiefly  from  briefs 
supplied  by  the  Gaelic  Union. 

In  reply  to  one  of  these  speeches,  another 
Irish  Secretary,  Sir  G.  Trevelyan,  promised 
to  make  inquiries  as  to  the  practicability  or 
advisability  of  having  Irish-speaking  chil- 
dren first  instructed  through  the  medium  of 
their  own  language.  He  made  inquiry 
from  the  Commissioners  of  National  Edu- 
cation, and  their  reply  he  said  satisfied  him 
that  this  way  of  teaching  was  not  advisable 
or  practical.  This  reply,  the  Commis- 
sioners' Memorandum,  they  called  it,  was 
an  able  statement  of  their  case,  written  by 
those  who,  along  with  ready  pens,  had  the

most  intimate  acquaintance  with  the  sub- 
ject of  National  Education  of  any  persons 
in  Ireland.  To  this  Memorandum  the 
"  Society,"  so  lauded  by  Father  Yorke, 
never  thought  of  replying ;  nor  would  any 
member  of  the  "  Society "  have  since 
thought  of  noticing  the  Memorandum.  In 
fact,  it  was  believed  to  be  unanswerable. 
The  Gaelic  Union,  so  far  from  dreading  the 
arguments  and  facts  of  the  Memorandum, 
published  it  at  a  cost  of  ,£16  in  the  Gaelic 
Journal,  gave  to  it  circulation  gratis,  and 
answered  it  word  for  word,  sentence  for 
sentence,  in  another  issue  of  their  Journal ; 
and  the  answer  has  been  pronounced  in 
Parliament  and  elsewhere  to  be  a  complete 
success.  Father  Yorke  was  not  in  Dublin 
while  all  these  events  had  been  taking 
place  ;  but  it  is  really  astonishing  that  he 
has  not  been  informed  of  them.  The 
Gaelic  Union  sent  deputations  to  the  Irish 
Secretary  and  the  Lord  Lieutenant ;  but  as 
in  the  other  cases,  Father  Yorke  has  never 
heard  of  these  deputations. 

Another  piece  of  information  that  may 
appear  strange  to  him  is,  that  his  "  Society," 
some  years  ago,  in  an  annual  report,  com- 
plained that  the  examinations  of  the 
National  teachers  in  Irish  were  too  hard. 
Next  day  a  letter  appeared  in  the  Fireman 
denying  this,  and  asserting  that  any  person 
having  a  good  "grammatical  knowledge  of 
Irish  grammar"  would  get  a  certificate  from 
the  National  Board,  &c,  Ac. 

At  the  foot  of  this  letter  was  the  name 
of  a  member  of  the  Council  of  the  "  Society," 
and  no  person  in  the  "  Society  "  has  since 
asked  him  for  an  explanation  of  this  trans- 
action. The  Gaelic  Journal  noticed  the 
transaction  after  a  considerable  time,  on 
finding  that  the  "  Society"  passed  it  over, 
and  the  writer  of  the  letter  sent  a  rather 
angry  note  to  the  late  editor  of  the  Journal, 
denying  his  having  ever  written  such  a  letter. 
He  had  hopes  that  the  paper  in  which  it 
appeared  might  have  been  lost,  but  it  had 
not,  and  so  he  was  informed.  And  this 
gentleman  was  one  of  the  deputation  ap- 
pointed by  the  "Society"  to  accompany 
Father  Yorke  to  the  late  Teachers' Congress. 
Of  course  Father  Yorke  was  never  informed 
of  this  little  transaction. 


The  Rev.  Father  Yorke  has  also,  perhaps 
unconsciously.donean  injustice  to  the  Gaelic 
Union  in  respect  of  the  publications,  so- 
called,  of  the  Society  for  the  Preservation  of 
the  Irish  Language.  Father  Yorke  calls 
them  the  "  Society's  Publications,"  and  so 
did  the  Very  Rev.  Father  MacTernan  a  few 
months  ago  ;  and  I  have  since  seen  his  words 
quoted  in  an  American  paper.  "  Sic  vos 
non  vobis."  For  the  details  of  these  publi- 
cations I  take  this  extract  from  the  last 
Report  of  his  "  Society."  "The  following 
is  the  account  of  the  books  sold  within  the 
present  year  "  : — 

Since  the 
beginning. 

Of  the  First  Irish  Book,  2, 368  copies; 

making  a  total  of  44730 

Of  the    Second  Irish    Book    1,372

Of  the  books  in  these  totals  not  a  line 
was  written  by  any  person  remaining  in 
the  "Society"  after  the  secession — I  alone 
excepted.  The  following  are  the  publi-

the  beginning        ....     2847 

The  work  done  by  the  learned  Society 
in  the  seven  or  eight  years  since  the  seces- 
sion consists,  then,  in  making  three  voca- 
bularies— one  for  each  of  the  three  books 
named  above.  The  contents  of  the  books — 
text,  translation,and  notes, they  found  ready 
to  their  hands.  And  of  the  vocabularies, 
that  to  the  Pursuit  of  Diarmuid  and  Grainne, 
Part  I.,  contains  1 13  errors,  and  those  in  ele- 
mentary matters;  and  that  to  Part  II.,  I 
believe  is  nearly  as  faulty.  Surely  it  is 
enough  for  the  "  Society  "  to  put  the  price 


THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


of  these  publications  in  the  purse — the  credit 
of  compiling  them  should  not  be  filched 
away  from  those  who  did  the  work  !  The 
First  Irish  Book  was  attacked  immediately 
after  being  published  by  a  gentleman  of 
Trinity  College,  who  stamped  upon  it.  Nor 
a  member  of  the  "Society"  ever  said  a 
word  for  the  little  work — to  rescue  it  was 
left  to  me  and  to  two  other  members  of 
the  Gaelic  Union. 

The  Society  has  other  merits  of  a  negative 
kind.  The  readers  of  the  Gaelic  Journal will 
have  an  opportunity  of  reading  at  length  in 
the  last  and  previous  issue  certain  inscrip- 
tions on  tombs  in  Glasnevin  cemetery  for 
which  the  Society  modestly  claims  credit. 

Father  Yorke  says,  with  perfect  truth, 
among  many  other  truths  : — -"  It  is  very 
doubtful  whether  we  would  ever  have  such 
Keltic  scholars  as  O'Connor,  O'Donovan, 
O'Curry,  and  many  others, unless  they  spoke 
the  language  naturallyfrom  theirchildhood." 
We  should  certainly  not  have  such  scholars. 
Neither  O'Donovan  nor  O'Curry  would  be 
an  Irish  scholar  at  all  had  he  not  spoken 
the  language  in  childhood  :  both  were  too 
poor  to  study  Irish  as  a  dead  language, 
even  if  inclined,  which  they  might  not  be. 
In  fact,  no  person  who  has  not  a  colloquial 
knowledge  of  the  language  can  be  a  first- 
class  Irish  scholar.  To  acquire  this  know- 
ledge, by  those  who  have  not  spoken  the 
language  since  childhood,  men  of  gigantic 
talents,  perfect  literary  training,  and 
possessing  an  intimate  acquaintance  with 
the  grammars  of  many  other  languages 
— these  men,  and  these  only,  I  say,  can 
acquire  a  colloquial  knowledge  of  the 
language,  and  are  acquiring  it,  in  this 
country,  on  the  continent,  and  in  America. 
Now  such  being  the  case,  I  would  ask 
Father  Yorke,  why  did  he  submit  the 
"Short  Catechism''  to  be  maltreated  by 
persons  who  are  not  Irish  scholars,  nor 
scholars  at  all,  and  who  do  not  speak  the 
Irish  language  ?  I  put  the  question  in 
sorrow,  not  in  anger.  Father  Yorke,  I 
believe,  is  one  of  the  very  few  that  would 
work  for  the  Irish  language  without  the 
motives  of  need,  or  greed,  or  praise.  He 
is  not  an  Irish  speaker,  and  could  not,  con- 
sequently, be   aware    of    the   emptiness   of 


shams  and  quacks.  Persons  very  zealous 
in  any  cause  are  easily  imposed  upon  by 
ignorant  audacity ;  and  they  very  often 
under  its  direction  inflict  serious  injury  on 
the  cause  they  love  best.  No  man  could 
love  the  Irish  language  more  unselfishly 
than  William  Smith  O'Brien,  and  it  is 
doubtful  whether  any  man  in  his  time  in- 
jured it  more.  After  the  death  of  O'Curry, 
his  place  was  asked  for  the  best  living 
man, —  the  late  William  Williams,  of  Dun- 
garvan  ;  he  was  the  best  Irish  scholar  in  the 
south  of  Ireland,  and  he  was  as  unselfish  in 
his  love  of  the  language  as  Smith  O'Brien  or 
Father  Yorke.  The  application  was  made  by 
Father  Patrick  Meany,  the  founder  of  the 
Keating  Society,  as  honest  a  man  as  Smith 
O'Brien  himself,  and  far  and  away  a  better 
Irish  scholar.  Mr.  O'Brien,  however,  was 
able  to  get  the  situation  for  the  reader  of  the 
Callan  ojaiii  ;  and  who  can  compute  the 
injury  thus  entailed  on  the  language  !  I 
have  before  me  the  letter  of  Mr.  W.  M. 
Hennessy  to  the  Athenaeum,  dissecting  the 
questions  set  to  candidates  on  Celtic  by 
the  reader  of  the  oJAtu  at  the  first  Inter- 
mediate Examinations  ;  and  had  not  Mr. 
Hennessy,  by  a  sublime  act  of  charity, 
squelched  this  examiner,  he  would  have 
squelched  the  Intermediate  Examinations 
in  Celtic  as  those  in  the  Royal  University 
were  squelched.  Such  are  the  effects  of  the 
best-intentioned  people  when  imposed  upon 
by  shams  ! 

The  teaching  of  Irish  in  our  colleges,  and 
schools,  and  Universities  is  so  much  gained  ; 
but  I  certainly  would  not  have  undergone 
years  of  labour,  and  anxiety,  and  loss,  for 
these  advantages.  I  took  all  this  trouble 
in  the  hopes  that  I  might  help  to  have  the 
poor  children  in  Irish-speaking  districts 
brought  up  as  intelligent  beings.  In  1857, 
I  read  one  of  Sir  Patrick  Keenan's  Reports 
from  Donegal ;  and  I  believed  that  his 
reasoning  was  too  cogent  to  be  resisted. 
His  other  reports,  and  afterwards  his  evi- 
dence at  the  Royal  Commission,  further 
convinced  me  that  he  only  required  pressure 
enough  from  without  to  put  his  plans  into 
operation.  I  am  every  day  now  being 
asked  questions  innumerable :  "  Was  he 
sincere  in  his  reports  and  evidence  ?    Would

he  give  the  same  replies  now  if  examined  ? 
And  if  so,  why  has  he  not  put  his  own 
plans  into  operation  ?"  To  these  my  replies 
will  be  direct.  He  was  as  sincere  in  his 
recommendations  as  I  should  be  if  in  his 
place  ;  and  he  would  give  the  same  replies 
to-day  as  in  1868,  had  he  been  asked  the 
same  questions.  Moreover,  had  it  depended 
on  himself,  he  would  have  put  his  plans 
into  operation  ;  but  he  knew  quite  well 
that  neither  his  fellow-commissioners  nor 
the  Treasury  would  allow  him  to  do  so, 
except  under  the  pressure  of  a  general 
demand.  Nay  more  ;  had  he  been  a  simple 
manager  of  a  school,  and  especially  had 
he  been  a  Catholic  priest,  he  would  have 
acted  upon  his  own  plan  ;  and  his  success 
would  encourage  him  to  redoubled  exertion, 
and  would  have  such  influence  upon  his 
neighbours  that,  from  Derry  to  Tramore, 
every  child  at  this  time  would  be  taught  to 
read  Irish  at  first  in  the  school,  and  through 
Irish,  he  would  be  taught  to  read  and  under- 
stand English.  And  what  would  all  this 
amount  to  ?  Just  what  it  amounts  to  in 
Wales.  The  Welsh  child  reads  Welsh  in 
six  months  as  well  as  he  could  read  English 
in  two  years.  Having  learned  to  read  his 
own  language,  he  goes  to  the  English  school 
without  a  word  of  English  in  his  mouth  ; 
he  never  heard  English  at  home  ;  and  yet 
he  is  able  to  hold  his  own  against  the 
English-speaking  child  at  the  results  ex- 
aminations, which  are  all  carried  on  in  Eng- 
lish. The  child  in  Donegal  or  Connemara 
is  as  intelligent  as  his  cousin  of  the  Princi- 
pality. At  the  age  of  twelve  or  thirteen 
years,  he  reads  ;  "  We  get  turf  from  the 
bog  ;"  but  he  cannot  tell  what  turf  or  bog 
means.  He  grows  up,  and  after  a  few 
years  at  school  he  has  just  as  much  book 
knowledge  as  an  Ojibbaway  Indian.  He 
is  whipped  to  make  him  forget  Irish — but 
he  never  learns  English.  Of  all  the  re- 
sources wasted,  or  lying  unused,  in  Ireland, 
the  waste  of  the  intellects  of  our  Irish- 
speaking  people  is  the  greatest  and  the 
saddest.  One  fifth  of  our  people  speak 
Irish — one-fifth  of  our  school-going  chil- 
dren, then,  speak  Irish.  A  moiety  of 
these,  at  least,  can  never  learn  by  the 
present  system,  except  as  parrots.     It  is  not 


hard  to  calculate  the  number  of  these 
intellects  let  run  to  waste  since  the  date  of 
Sir  Patrick's  Report,  published  thirty  years 
ago.  Of  the  people  thus  brought  up,  hun- 
dreds of  thousands  emigrated  and  became 
hewers  of  wood  and  drawers  of  water  ;  and 
hundreds  of  thousands  of  them  are  still 
huddled  together  in  the  "  Irish  quarters  " 
of  the  large  cities  of  Great  Britain  and 
America.  And  in  this  third  of  a  century 
not  one  manager  could  be  found  in  all 
Ireland  to  give  a  trial  to  Sir  Patrick 
Keenan's  plan.  The  Welsh  people  were  as 
hopelessly  drifting  into  ignorance  as  dark 
as  ours,  when  rescued  from  destruction  by 
the  exertions  of  two  poor  clergymen,  men 
apparently  with  as  little  means  as  any  of 
our  school  managers.  But  Ireland  had  nei- 
ther a  Griffith  Jones  nor  a  Thomas  Charles. 
When  the  monster  memorial  was  presented 
to  the  Commissioners  of  National  Educa- 
tion, had  the  "  Society"  for  the  Preservation 
of  the  Irish  Language  preserved  their 
organization,  I  believe  they  could  since 
have  perfectly  instructed  the  people  of  the 
country  as  to  the  right  way  of  educating 
the  poor  children  of  the  seaboard.  All 
persons  understand  the  axioms ;  and  there 
is  no  axiom  plainer  than  that  which  says  : 
"  A  child  must  be  taught  through  the 
medium  of  the  language  he  knows."  This 
is  so  plain,  that  nobody  has  yet  denied  its 
truth  ;  people  who  would  deny'  it,  if  they 
could,  content  themselves  with  passing  it  by. 
As  I  said,  had  the  Society  been  intelligent 
or  patriotic,  they  would  have  instructed  the 
people,  hierarchy,  clergy,  gentry,  Members 
of  Parliament ;  and  the  Irish-speaking  chil- 
dren would  since  have  been  properly  taught. 
But  a  few  men  in  the  Society,  urged  on  by 
need,  or  greed,  or  vanity,  began  to  quarrel 
among  themselves,  and  gave  up  to  be- 
labouring one  another  the  energies  and  exer- 
tions  that  had  got  the  great  memorial  signed. 
Such  were  our  Irish  organizations  ! 

And  is  the  Irish  worth  preserving  ?  Yes  ; 
but  not  the  quasi  Irish  introduced  into  our 
Class-books  and  Catechisms  ;  or  that  en- 
graved upon  our  monuments  by  the 
"  Society."  May  the  tongue  of  the  saints 
and  the  sages  perish  from  the  mouths  of  the 
people  before  it  becomes  such  a  jargon  !

THE   GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


I  now  appeal  to  Father  Yorke.  There 
are  in  the  "  Society  "  others — many  others 
—  who  love  the  old  tongue  well.  I  appeal 
to  all  these.  I  ask  them,  do  they  think  that 
corrupting  this  tongue  is  theway  to  preserve 
it  ?  I  beg  of  them  to  look  into  the  Review 
in  No.  24  of  the  Gaelic  Journal  of  the  Pur- 
suit of  Diarmuid  and  Grainne,  and  then  to 
judge  for  themselves.  They  will  acknow- 
ledge that  in  the  interests  of  the  native 
tongue  it  is  high  time  to  protest  against  the 
proceedings  referred  to  therein.  Hi  beev

P.S. — The  above  was  written  in  July  last, 
but  was  crushed  out  of  No.  25.  In  the 
future  issues  of  the  Journal,  Irish  will  take 
up  more  than  half  its  pages,  and  I  will  look 
more  sharply  at  every  article  to  be  inserted  in  it.

O'CURNAN'S  SONG. 
The  following  song,  translation  and  me- 
moir were  inserted  by  the  Editor  in  the 
Teachers  Journal  some  years  since  ;  and 
were  afterwards  reprinted  in  the  Teachers' 
A  linanac.  To  preserve  them,  we  insert  them 
in  the  second  number  of  our  third  volume: — 

In  one  of  our  periodicals  for  July,  1S50 — I  suspect  the 
Dublin  University  Magazine,  but  I  have  only  the  few 
pages  of  it  which  contain  the  review  on  the  Poets  and 
Poetry  of  Munster,  and  the  title  is  not  on  these  pages — 
the  reviewer,  after  enumerating  the  names  of  those  whose 
poetry  appeared  in  the  volume,  asks:  "But  where  is 
Dermod  O'Curnan?  Why  has  all  mention  of  him  been 
omitted  ? — yet  he  deserved  a  niche  in  that  miniature 
temple  of  the  Momonian  muse,  as  well  from  the  interest 
attached  to  his  tragical  story,  as  from  the  intrinsic  merit 
of  his  poetry.  .  .  .  We  have  never  met  with  any  of 
O'Curnan's  poems  translated  or  printed,  and  though  we 
have  seen  some  of  them  iii  MS.  among  the  peasantry  in 
the  count)-  of  Waterford,  we  believe  they  are  chiefly  pre- 
served by  oial  tradition.  Dermod  O'Curnan,''  the  re- 
viewer continues,  "  the  son  of  a  farmer,  was  born  about 
or  a  little  before  [740,  in  the  county  of  Cork,  but  resided 
after  he  grew  up  in  the  parish  of  Modeligo,  county  of 
Waterford.  Young  O'Curnan  was  peculiarly  gifted  by 
nature  ;  he  had  a  finely-formed  person,  a  strikingly  hand- 
some face,  deep  and  ardent  feelings,  and  considerable 
abilities."  I  had  copied  thus  far  two  weeks  ago.  when  I 
was  interrupted,  and  on  resuming  my  task  I  could  not  find 
the  original,  nor  have  I  since  succeeded  in  finding  it. 
This  is  a  loss  to  the  learner,  as  it  contained  a  spirited 
metrical  version  of  the  song,  together  with  some  remarks 
mi  O'Curnan's  compositions,  and  a  brief  sketch  of  his 
career,  correct  except  m  one  particular.  It  says  that 
O'Curnan  was  deprived  of  his  reason  by  a  philtre  given 
him  by  a  young  woman  in  Modeligo,  whom  he  afterwards 
Killed  by  cutting  off  her  head  with  a  bid-hook.  Aboul 
the  date  of  the  critique  (1S50),  and  for  a  long  time  before, 
there  iived  not  far  from  Modeligo  a  literary  lady,  a  dili- 
gent seaicher  out  of  antiquities,  but  too  fond  of  the  mar- 
vellous to  rest  content  with  a  plain,  correct  account  of 


any  subject.  This  propensity  gave  quizzers  an  oppor- 
tunity ol  playing  off  their  hoaxes  upon  her,  as  in  the  pre- 
sent instance!  But  poor  O'Curnan's  story  was  tragical 
enough  without  the  aid  of  fiction.  Hired  by  a  farmer  in 
Modeligo,  who  had  but  one  child,  a  little  girl,  Curnan 
was  given  to  understand  that  on  her  coming  to  a  marriage- 
able age  her  hand,  and  the  farm  together,  would  lie 
bestowed  upon  him,  provided  he  served  faithfully  until 
then.  He  served  seven  years,  it  is  said,  and,  like  the 
patriarch  of  old,  was  cheated.  Being  sent  to  Cork  to 
sell  some  loads  of  corn,  and  buy  the  wedding  dress,  &c, 
the  young  woman,  during  his  absence,  was  married  to 
another  man,  who  had  a  fortune.  Curnan  travelled  day 
and  night,  but  a  long  journey,  a  century  ago,  could  not 
lie  gol  over  in  a  hurry.  As  he  approached  the  home  of 
his  betrothed  early  in  the  morning,  he  was  met  by  the 
wedding  parly,  going  to  their  respective  homes  after  the 
night,  and  it  is  said  that  some  of  them  made  him  the 
butt  of  their  ridicule.  Entering  the  house,  and  learning 
how  matters  stood,  he  threw  into  the  fire  the  '  favours  ' 
he  had  brought  from  Cork,  as  well  as  his  own  clothes,  and 
for  ever  alter  roamed  over  the  country  a  simpleton — but 
with  his  poetical  powers  intact — and  always  engaged  in 
singing  his  own  misfortunes  and  the  cruelty  of  his  Mai)'. 
O'Curnan's  story  was  known  to  every  man  and  woman  in 
the  county  of  Waterford  fihy  years  ago,  and  there  are 
persons  still  living  who  saw  him  ;  lor  instance,  Mr. 
O'Daly,  of  Anglesea-street,  a  native  of  Mod  ligo— but  no 
one  evei  heard  of  the  love  potion  or  the  murder.  To 
make  'assurance  doubly  sure,'  I  wrote  to  Modeligo  a 
short  time  since,  and  received  from  the  best  po  ible 
authority  there  the  assurance  that  the  philtre  and  outrage 
were  baseless  fictions.  Of  the  song  I  have  had  copies 
made  for  me  by  two  young  friends,  in  remote  parts  ol  the 
country,  from  the  dictation  of  persons  in  their  respective 
localities,  but  I  could  not  contrive  to  get  out  of  these 
copies  more  than  three  stanzas,  though  the  translation  in 
the  revi  :w  contains  four  stanzas.  But.  defective  even  as 
it  is.  it  should  be  preserved  as  being  unique — the  real  com 
piesition  of  a  maniac.  The  songs  and  sayings  of  other 
hear.  Ophelia,  òcc. — were  composed  by  persons 
in  the  full  possession  of  reason,  but  in  this  we  have  the 
very  expressions  of  the  maniac  himself.  Some  months 
agi  1  it  was  asked  in  the  Irish  Monthly  was  Moore  a  thief— 
an  original,  or  something  very  like  it,  of  one  of  his  most 
celebrated  compositions  being  found  among  the  works  of 
a  French  poet.  Of  poor  O'Curnan's  song,  too,  there  is 
in  the  Irish  MSS.  presented  to  the  R.I.  A.  by  William  S. 
O'Brien  an  original  composed  by  Michael  Cummins  for 
liar  lie;  Stacpoole.  which  is  as  like  this  song  as  the  French 
original  is  to  Moore's.  .Should  any  of  our  friends  have  a 
perfeel  version  of  the  song,  I  would  be  very  thankful  for 
a  loan  of  it  for  a  day  while  making  a  copy  of  it."

0  Mary,  sweet  and  fair,  who  left  this  sigh  in  my  heart 

(midst), 
That  the  isle  of  Fodla  (Ireland)  would  not  cure  ; 
And  I  would  swear  by  my  hand,  hadst  thou  understood 
my  case, 
That  thou  couldst  not  let  me  die  without  relief. 

1  take  not  an  ounce  of  food,  I  sleep  not  a  wink  when  I  lie- 

down  ; 
There  is  no  liveliness  in  me  or  strength  but  as  a  shadow 
Unless  I  find  time  and  opportunity  of  speaking  to  my 

heart's  love, 
I  will  not  live  a  month  or  a  quarter. 


No  one  living  knows  my  case  or  its  cure, 

Except  the  woman  who  has  sickened  me  ; 
My  cure  is  not  on  sea  or  strand,  not  in  herb  or  in  [skill 
of]  hand, 

My  cure  is  only  in  the  Flower  of  Youth  : 
I  know  not  cuckoo  from  hen,  nor  know  I  heat  from  cold, 

At  no  time  do  I  know  my  friends  ; 
I  know  not  night  from  day,  though  my  heart  would  kn 
its  love, 

Should  she  come  in  time  and  save  me. 


Save  me,  dearest,  do  ;   give   me  a  sweet  kiss  from  thy 
mouth 

And  raise  me  up  to  thyself  from  death  ; 
Or  bespeak  for  me  a  narrow  bed,  in  a  close  deal  coffin. 

In  the  company  of  the  chafer  and  his  kindred. 
My  existence  is  not  life,  but  death  ;  my  uiterance  not 
voice,  but  wind, 

I  have  no  colour,  life,  or  health  ; 
But  teariul,  sad,  feeble,  without  music,  sport,  or  power, 

In  slavery  and  affliction,  for  love  of  thee. 

CneA-o,  sigh,  groan  ;  VowIa,  one  of  the  names  for  Ire- 
land ;  rjÁiLe,  a  shadow  ;  T$.\\l,  in  Munsier  ;  bpigh, 
strength;  Cfva-oh,  p.iin  ;  niA-pA,  colloquially  for  hhiiia. 
unless  ;  f  ajIiaiiii,  I  find  ;  mini  a  bh-yAgliAroh  me,  unless  Í 
find  or  get ;  uain,  time,  leisure;  fgich,  rest;  La-p,  the 
ground,  midst  :  aon-ne,  forAon  «each,  anyone;  tuibh, 
an  herb ;  Lámh,  hand,  skill  ;  blAch,  a  blossom  ;  ha 
h-oije,  of  youth  ;  111  aicrlirrgrnrn,  I  do  not  know  ;  ciiAch. 
a  cuckoo  ;  cea-pc,  a  hen  ;  cap,  beyond,  rather  than  ;  yóip, 
save,  relieve;  Am  '-rhoi-pchin,  to  my  relief;  cumr-ran, 
convenience,  vicinity  ;  tjaoI.  gen.  -oaoil,  a  chafer.   Sin,  in 


the  second  line,  is  an  expletive,  and  pronounced  pan.  It 
occurs  very  early  in  the  Irish  Imitation.  11  ac  in  lines 
two  and  four  are  pronounced  11Á.  "O'AicmeocATj 
(•OAiÉ'neocA-ó),  conditional  mood  of  aicmjim.  The  final 
letter  c  in  jaoc  is  pronounced  in  Minister  M&sgh  in  lough. 


VOCABULARY  AND  ERRATA 
To  the  First  Part  of  S5e1.1L  111  ic  bj\At>Áín. 

It  may  be  necessary  to  remark  that  this 
story  was  taken  down  just  as  delivered 
without  any  attempt  at  grammatical  cor- 
rections. Of  course  it  is  not  intended  as  a 
specimen  of  classical  Irish,  but  rather  of  the 
dialect  used  in  the  Middle  Island  of  Arann. 
Accordingly  the  peculiar  forms  ending  in  b, 
of  the  third  person  plural  of  the  preposi- 
tional pronouns  are  used  throughout,  forms 
referred  to  in  my  letter  to  the  Gaelic 
Journal,  Vol.  II.,  p.  222.  However  local 
peculiarities  must  be  carefully  distinguished 
from  press  errors.  Both  are  included  in 
the  following  vocabulary  : — 

Column  i. 
Line    2.   For  conn   riiAic    Aoip  read  conn   mate   aoir-', 
literally,  "a  good  wave  of  age,"  meaning  that 
he  was  pretty  far   ad  sauced   in   years.     Ex- 
pression peculiar  to  the  west  coast. 
,,       5.   11-1  a]-j.  the  pronunciation  of  the  "  thick  slender 
11,"  íequires  for  its  expression  the  prefixing  of 
11    before    nouns   beginning   with   vowels   in 
situations  similar  to  this,  although  according 
to  the  grammars  the  n  of  Aen  or  Aon  is  not 
repealed. 
,,       6.  "Oo  caic  yé,  &c.     "  He  spent  a  long  time  in  this 
way."     bealAC  is  noi  used   in  this  sense   in 
Minister. 

7.  1  n-imceacc  Ail  lae,  during  the  day. 

8.  a  jaba-D,  local  abbreviation  for  JAbAit. 
10.  icineacu,  local  form  for  éipn,  a  certain,  a  par- 
ticular (day).

14.  a   -oopuba,   a  line  of  any  kind,  particularly  a 
fishing  line.

15.  pope,  bank,  wharf,  shore. 

Column  2. 
Line    I.  -co  bapp  ah  Lac   read  no  bÁp,  etc.,  as  a  day's 
return  ;  bap,  crop,  produce. 

„  4.  An  c-Aen  n-iApg.  In  Connaught  Aon  is  used  in 
the  abstract.  Aen  in  the  concrete.  For  n-iar-g 
see  above,  col.  1,  1.  5. 

,,  6.  céA-p'-o,  abbr.  of  cé  An  pu-o,  by  metathesis 
cpeiro.     Catj  is  more  used  in  Munster. 

,,  7.  -ò'a  peucamc,  literally,  "  to  its  trying,''  i.e.,  try- 
ing it.  See  Joyce's  Grammar,  p.  116.  The 
-o  of  tj\\  is  aspirated  for  euphonic  reasons. 

,,  13.  Aip  bpuAC.  Aip  in  the  we>t  only  aspirates  in 
certain  cases,  /.;*.,  when  the  dative  governs  a 
genitive  after  it.  .See  above  Aip  bpuAC  ha 
h-Aibiie.

NOTE. — It    is    of   importance    that    local    peculiarities 
should  be  noted  correctly,  especially  in  remote  localities 
where  the  language  has  been  preserved  in  great   purity. 
There  is,  however,  no  locality  in  which  corruptions  have 
not  crept  in.

(The  Fair  of  Windgap)  : 
A  Comic  Ballad,  by  UomÁp  O  tHópÁin. 

DeÁpnA  11A  ^Aoice,  Windgap,  is  a  town- 
land  adjoining  Four-mile- water,  mentioned 
in  No.  25  of  the  Journal.  The  fair  was 
held,  I  believe,  towards  the  end  of  August, 
and  was  attended  more  for  fun  than  for 
buyin  ;  and  sidling.  Among  those  who 
came  to  the  fair,  on  a  day,  more  than  half 
a  century  ago,  was  ComÁp  O  îTlópÁin,  or 
UomÁp  a'  OóüpÁin, — this  latter  name  he 
got  from  his  skill  in  playing  on  the  tam- 
bourine— a  boúpÁn   is   a   dried    sheep-skin 


stretched  on  a  hoop.  When  the  fair  was 
over,  UoniAp  strolled  to  the  house  of  Father 
Larkin,  the  P.P.  of  Four-mile-water,  and 
the  priest's  housekeeper  having  asked  him  : 
"  What  news  from  the  fair  ?"  he  got  pen,  ink, 
and  paper,  and  retiring  to  the  stable-loft, 
or  to  some  other  out-house,  he  composed 
the  ballad  named  above — a  ballad  very 
popularthroughout  the  county  of  Waterford, 
especially  in  the  localities  where  its  author 
was  known 

I  have  not  been  able  to  learn  of  what 
part  of  Ireland  the  poet  was  a  native.  He 
was  a  hedge  schoolmaster  for  some  time — - 
persons  are  still  living  who  attended  his 
school  in  Ciioc-a'  Lipin,  a  townland  about 
three  miles  from  Four-mile-water,  and  in 
the  same  parish,  I  believe. 

Having  given  up  the  teaching  profession, 
during  his  life  afterwards  he  lived  as  a 
strolling  minstrel,  playing  on  the  bóópÁn, 
and  singing  to  its  accompaniment.  UómÁp 
Ail  ceó  was  another  soubriquet  of  his — a 
name  he  got  on  account  of  his  playing  the 
part  of  ventriloquist  in  a  slight  way. 
Putting  his  mouth  down  into  a  hat,  he  used 
to  say:  \\  comÁipin  An  ceó  ip  potpire 
(poippe)  Ail  tunne  cu.  To  this  remark  he 
replied   in  a  squeaking  voice  :    1p  beAj  ah 

C-lOll^llA-O   tlAlll,   ippATj'    Ó    piAlll    A   purAÚ   1llé. 

The  only  other  composition  of  UómÁp  a' 
OójpÁin,  that  I  have  heard,  is  a  description 
in  three  or  four  stanzas  of  a  vicious  horse 
owned  by  a  farmer  named  Ducy,  who  lived 
in  Deerpark,  not  far  from  Windgap. 

UóniÁp  gave  the  manuscript  of  this  ballad 
to  the  priest  who  attended  him  in  his  last 
illness  ;  and  the  manuscript  came  into  my 
hands.  The  penmanship  was  that  of  a 
person  not  much  practised  in  writing  Irish. 
The  metrical  translation  is  by  M.  Cavanagh, 
formerly  of  Cappoquin,  in  the  county  of 
Waterford,  now  in  America,  a  gentleman 
who  has  made  graphic  and  spirited  versions 
of  many  of  our  songs  and  ballads.  The 
stanza  marked  VIIa  is  not  in  the  English 
version.  Stanzas  X  and  \[  are  not  in 
O'Daly's  Irish  Miscellany,  though  it  was 
I  gave  him  the  piece.  I  think  there  is  a 
stanza  omitted  in  this  copy,  too,  but  I  have 
not  my  manuscript  at  hand  :  if  I  recollect 
aright,  the  copy  I  wrote  for  the  Irishman 


THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL.

newspaper,  some  years  since,  contains  all 
the  stanzas  of  the  ballad.  As  the  ballad 
is  chiefly  intended  for  learners,  a  literal 
translation  is  given  in  which  will  be  found 
the  translation  of  the  words  not  in  the 
vocabulary.

[TRANSLATION.] 
THE  FAIR  OF  WINDGAP. 


At  the  fair  there  was  fine  diversion, 

Much  of  fun  and  jollity  ; 
Delightful  music,  sport  and  revelry, 
Meat  getting  ready  for  food  there. 
There  were  whiskey,  ale,  and  Geneva  wine, 
And  strong  blood-red  brandy  ; 
The  flour  of  wheat,  gingerbread, 
And  cheese  on  the  scales  for  sale  there. 
II. 
There  were  sugars,  seeds,  and  raisins  ; 
Honey  from  combs  was  flowing  there  : 
A  world  of  wine,  the  flesh  of  chickens, 
With  gravy  mild,  well-tasted  : 
Flesh  of  the  heath-cock  there  was  sweet, 
With  flesh  of  stare  and  snipe  too  ; 
The  broth  of  calf,  with  leek  and  salt 
Flavoured,  and  a  pail  full  sold  for  sixpence. 

III. 

There  were  rug  and  taper,  kersey  and  fear- 
not  ; 
A  vest  made  of  the  best  materials, 


23 


THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


Russia-duck,  jaen,  beautiful  cassimeres  ; 

And  Spanish  cloth  of  silken  texture  : 

White,  red,  green,  blue,  for  good  wear, 

And  black  for  the  highest  nobility. 
The  orange  decamped  in  dread  of  a  beating, 

But   whole   hosts   purchased    the  yellow 
there. 

IV. 
Wool  was  for  sale  there,  oil,  and  cards, 

Of  tow  and  flax  a  plenty  ; 

Hats  fine  and  smooth  of  rabbit  fur  ; 

The  choicest  shoes  and  stockings. 
Tobacco  pipes,  a  great  deal  of  snuff, 

Bonnets,  screens,  and  robes. 
Quarrelling  and  fighting  closed  the  scene 
The  effects  of  drops  of  drink  there. 


There  were  knives  and  forks,  razors,  awls, 

Pots,  pans,  and  canteens  : 
Forty-one  tents,  with  many  standings  ; 
Of  linen  cloth  a  great  deal. 
Warm  friezes,  blankets,  quilts, 
Flannels,  cloaks  and  sheets  ; 
Fine  wooden  dishes  and  churn-dashes, 

Butter  churns  and  piggins. 


There  were  cows,  horses,  calves,  goats,  pigs, 

sheep, 
Asses  were  in  great  demand  there. 
For    a    good    milch    cow    seven    yellow 

guineas  ; 
Dry  cows  were  middling  dear  there. 
Fourpound  three  for  a  sowand  young  pigs, 
And  their  numbers  there  were  enormous ; 
But  for  the  sucking-pigs  there  was  just 

nothing, 
They  were  not  worth  selling  at  all  there. 

THE  FAIR  OF  WINDGAP. 

M.  Cavanagh. 
(From  the  Irish  of  Thomas  Moran. ) 


At  "  Windgap  Fair,"  I  witnessed  there 
All  sorts  of  fun  and  pleasure  : 

We'd  music  sweet  to  shake  our  feet, 
And  sport  beyond  all  measure. 

Spoileen,  pig's  head  and  gingerbread — 
Fur  hungry  folk  to  cat  there: 


With  brandy  fine,  strong  ale  and  wine, 
And  whiskey  (sure)  to  treat  there. 


Nice  "  sugarstick  "  for  boys  to  lick, 

And  tempting  combs  of  honey  ; 
With  raisins  sweet,  and  chicken-meat — 

To  coax  the  youngster's  money. 
All  kinds  of  game,  fowls,  wild  and  tame, 

Fed  pampered  folk  and  sinful  ; 
While  seasoned  broth  poor  people  bought — 

For  sixpence  they'd  a  skinful. 

III. 

There  gay  " sŷorteens"  might  chose  "rat- 
teens," 

And  vests  to  please  their  fancy  ; 
With  "  Russia-duck"  to  suit  a  "  buck," 

And  silks  to  deck  "  Miss  Nancy  ;" 
"  Old  Erin's  green  "  on  crowds  were  seen, 

Red,  white,  black,  blue  and  yellow  ; 
But  "  Orange  "  fled — for  fear  his  head 

We'd  break — the  hateful  fellow  ! 


Wool,  tow,  and  flax,  with  cards  in  packs, 

Fine  lots  of  "  Irish  beavers  ;" 
And  brogues  galore,  decked  with  five-score 

Of  "  crabbit- heads  "  or  "  pavers  !  " 
Those  "  up  to  snuff  "  may  find  enough 

To  suit  the  proudest  nose  there  ; 
Or  smoke  and  drink  until  the)-  wink, 

Then  end  their  spree  in  blows  there. 


On  hardware  stalls  were  razors,  awls, 

Knives,  forks,  tin-cans  and  kettles  : 
With  pans  and  pots  in  sorted  lots, 

And  various  kinds  of  metals. 
There  tents,  two  score,  were  quilted  o'er 

With  blankets,  sheets,  and  friezes  ; 
While  dairy-ware  in  piles  were  there, — 

The  kind,  good  housewife  prizes. 


There  horses,  kine,  goats,  sheep  and  swine, 

With  asses — "jacks  !"   and  "jennies  !" — 
You'd  see  (and  hear).    Milch  cows  were  dear 

(They  brought  ten  yellow  guineas). 
Sows  were  on  hand  in  great  demand, 

Dry-cows  brought  prices  high  there  ; 
But  "  òonniveens" scarce  fetched  "thirteens!" 

Them  no  one  cared  to  buy  there.

VERBS  OF  MONOSYLLABIC  ROOTS  IX  THE 
CONDITIONAL  MOOD  AND  THIRD  PERSON 
SINGULAR. 

BY  THE  EDITOR. 

Our  friends  in  America  are  earnestly  discussing  what 
is  the  correct  pronunciation  of  the  verbs  above  named, 
such  as  VniAilpeAT),  -o'ólpA-ó,  TJiinpA-o,  would  strike,  would 
drink,  would  shut.  On  the  one  side,  ihe  Editor  of  the 
Gad,  and  those  who  think  with  him,  would  pronounce 
these  as  if  written  buAibeócAÚ,  •o'oLóca-ö,  ■öùnócA'o  : 
just  like  verbs  in  the  same  mood  and  number  and  person 
of  more  syllables  than  one  in  the  roots.  Mr.  O'Donnell 
and  Mr.  \Vard,  &c,  on  the  other  hand,  would  pronounce 
such  verbs  as  they  are  written — buAilpeArj,  rj'ótjMVo, 
■ótnipAÓ.  Mr.  Logan  and  Mr.  O'Donnell  mentioned  my 
name  incidentally  during  the  discussion,  and  this  appeared 
to  the  Council  of  the  Gaelic  Union  to  afford  us  an  oppor- 
tunity of  discussing  the  question,  and  stating  our  opinions 
upon  it,  without  in  the  least  degree  dictating  or  dogma- 
tizing. The  meeting  at  which  the  question  was  discussed 
was  lairly  representative  of  the  different  provinces  of  Ire- 
land. Mr.  O'Farrelly  is  a  native  of  Meath  ;  the  secre- 
tary, Mr.  O'Mulrenin,  of  Roscommon  ;  Mr.  Walsh,  of 
Mayo  ;  Mr.  Morris,  of  Gahvay  ;  Mr.  O'Brien,  of  South- 
west Munster ;  and  I.  of  East  Munster.  All  are  Irish 
speakers  since  infancy,  and  nearly  all  first-class  Irish 
speakers,  as  well  as  Irish  scholars.  None  of  us  have 
ever  heard  the  words  pronounced  buAiieócA-ô,  &c,  ex- 
cept Mr.  Walsh,  who  heard  them  in  some  parts  of  his 
native  county,  but  the  people  there  all  use  the  other  forms 
as  well.  In  Waterford  three  verbs  are  pronounced  as  Mr. 
Logan  would  pronounce  them  :  as  rhApliocA-o  pé  me,  he 
would  kill  me ;  geobA-ó  pé  bó  50  ■o-ci  ah  eApbAlb  opm, 
he  would  win  a  cow  to  the  tail  from  me  (from  the  verb 
jAb)  ;  and  jeóbA-ö  pé  pu-o  aiiiac  tdá  g-cinppeA-ô  omne 
m  a  cbiAipé,  he  would  find  out  a  thing  if  one  had  put  it 
into  his  ear.

THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


Mr.  Ward's  remark,  that  a  great  deal  depends  upon  the 
ear  that  hears,  is  well  worth  taking  nonce  of.  The  cele- 
brated  Archbishop  Usher  went  to  Fore,  in  Westmeath, 
and  heard  the  people  there  pronounce  the  name  of  the 
place  batte teao-aip,  "the  town  of  the  books."  Arch- 
dall,  Lannigan.  and  all  writers  followed  this  pronuncia- 
tion until  L)r.  O'Donovan  visited  the  place  two  centuries 
afterwards.  For  his  ear  the  place  was  OAite  pol'Mip. 
"  the  town  of  Fore."  The  Rev.  James  Graves  was  at 
Affane,  near  Cappoquin,  County  Waterford,  where  the 
Fitzgeralds  and  Butlers  fought  a  fierce  battle,  The 
people  showed  him  where  the  battle  was  fought,  and  they 
called  it  botap  11  a  b-pox)pA.  He  wrote  to  1  Jr.  [oyce  for 
an  explanation,  and  Dr.  Joyce  enclosed  the  note  to  me  to 
Dungarvan,  where  I  was  then  sojourning.  I  took  the 
note  immediately  to  Mr.  William  Williams,  and  we  both 
were  at  fault.  A  man  in  the  office  of  Mr.  Williams  re- 
marked, "perhaps  he  meant  bocap  an  itiacaipe,  "the 
road  of  the  battle.'  Now,  this  name  is  pronounced  as 
clearly  as  New  York  is,  yet  Dr.  Graves,  an  Irish  scholar. 
did  not  catch  it.  Moie  singular  still  is  the  fact  that  Mr. 
O'Donnell  had  not  distinctly  caught  the  Munster  pronun- 
ciation ol  the  words  now  being  discussed  in  America.  He 
allowed  in  one  passage  of  a  letter  that  in  Munster  the 
people  pronounce  these  words  as  Mr.  Logan  says,  and  in 
another  place  that  they  appear  to  pronounce  them  so. 
Now  to  my  ear  they  do  not  ;  in  the  imperative  mood, 
third  person  singular,  the  verb  bnaiL  for  instance,  is 
buailea'ö  (yé),  let  him  strike,  pronounced  in  Munster  as 
if  written  buaibeac  (re).  The  conditional  mood,  third 
person  singular,  is  Vuiailveaxi  re,  he  would  strike,  pro- 
nounced buaiLpeAC  (re).  The  terminations  of  these  two 
verbs  are  identical,  and  there  is  no  oc»vó  sound  in  either 
of  them.  Now,  Mr.  O'Donnell  is  a  ripe  Irish  scholar; 
he  spoke  Irish  in  the  cradle  ;  he  has  always  spoken  it  ; 
for  years  he  heard  as  good  Irish  as  there  is  in  Munster. 
and  yet  he  was  not  quite  certain  of  the  Munster  pronun- 
ciation of  the  words  in  question. 

The  discussion  in  America  has  brought  to  light  a  trait 
of  Irish  character  that  we  should  set  before  ourselves  as  a 
model.  Mr.  Logan  disclaimed  having  Canon  Bourke  on 
his  side  of  the  argument,  preferring  truth  to  the  advan- 
tage of  the  learned  Canon's  authority.  Mr.  O'Donnell, 
though,  as  nearly  sure  as  possible  of  the  Munster  pronun- 
ciation bring  in  favour  ol  his  contention,  would  not  s  iy 
so  for  certain.  Of  course  I  know  the  truthfulness  of  my 
friend,  Mr.  O'Donnell,  and  I  am  proud  to  call  him  my 
friend.  Alas!  some  whom  they  have  eft  behind  in  the 
old  country  would  not  forego  an  advantage  over  an  oppo- 
nent for  truth's  sake. 

Mr.  Logan  found  in  O'Reilly's  Dictionary  that  the  num- 
ber of  verbs  taking  oca*  in  the  conditional  are  far  in 
excess  of  those  making  p«j.  I  have  totted  up  some 
pages  of  Keating  and  of  others,  and  the  excess  is  the 
other  way.  The  poems  in  this  number  of  the  Gaelic 
Journal  tell  the  same  tale.  No  doubt  the  Irish  language 
is  being  disintegrated  ;  on  my  own  side  of  a  range  of 
mountains  in  Waterford,  ci  prm,  &c,  is  the  rule,  whereas 
at  the  other  side,  about  bocap  an  macaipe  camAOro,  ,Vc. 
are  always  heard.  I  would  appeal,  then,  to  Mi.  Logan 
to  help  in  keeping  the  old  forms  in  the  mouths  of  the 
people.  In  the  case  of  new  and  such  like  they  are 
easier.  It  may  as  well  be  stated  here  that  third  sing,  of 
the  habitual  tense  active  is  pronounced  exactly  like  the 
same  person  of  the  imperative  and  conditional.  Thus  in 
•own,  shut. 

•ouiiatj  pe,  let  him  shut,  is  pronounced  minac  yé. 
■outnvù  re,  he  u.sed  to  shut,         ,,  ■ôúnac  ré. 

Ẃunpatj  pc,  he  would  shut,         ,,  -uunpac  ré. 


THE  SHORT  CATECHISM  (IRISH); 
THE  IRISH  IMITATION;  THE 
ROMAN  LETTER. 

Early  this  year  there  was  printed  for  the 
Kaffirs  a  penny  catechism,  translated  from 
the  English  into  their  dialect.  The  work 
was  published  by  one  of  our  monastic  con- 
fraternities, and  the  translation  was  made 
by  a  native  of  England  who  had  joined  the 
order  a  few  years  since.  Suppose  this 
Catechism  had  been  printed  in  Dublin, 
would  any  person  here,  who  had  learned 
from  books  a  little  of  the  Kaffir  dialect,  of 
which  he  could  not  speak  a  sentence, 
undertake  to  amend  and  alter  this  little 
work  as  the  spirit  moved  him  ?  Such  a 
thing  would  be  impossible  ;  but  what  would 
be  impossible  in  respect  of  the  African 
dialect,  was  done  without  compunction  in 
this  land  of  ours.  An  Irish  scholar  who 
preaches  in  Irish  on  every  Sunday  of  his 
life,  translated  the  Short  Catechism  into 
Irish,  and,  for  its  size,  a  more  difficult  book 
to  translate  there  is  nut  in  the  English  lan- 
guage. I  devoted  nearly  every  day  of  three 
weeks'  holidays  to  examining  the  manu- 
script of  the  translation — every  letter  of  it. 
The  proof  of  the  little  work  was  sent  to  Mr. 
Thomas  Flannery  to  London,  who  examined 
it  with  equal  care  ;  and  it  is  well  known 
that  no  man  alive  is  more  competent  for  such 
a  task  than  he.  There  were  eight  proofs  of 
the  work  corrected  by  members  of  the 
Gaelic  Union  before  they  resigned  it  as 
ready  to  be  published.  And  then  Father 
Yorke,  as  censor,  handed  the  "  little  affair  " 
over  to  three  or  four  others,  none  of  whom 
could  buy  fourpence  halfpenny  worth  of 
any  commodity  from  an  Irish  speaker. 
These  censors,  during  two  months,  turned 
over  the  Irish  and  Gaelic  dictionaries  and 
the  catechisms  in  the  Royal  Irish  Academy, 
looking  out  for  some  things  that  might 
embolden  them  to  change  a  few  words  in 
the  little  book — not  because  these  words 
were  faulty  in  respect  of  faith,  or  morals,  or 
devotion,  but  for  other  reasons. 

father  Conway  has  no  leisure  time.  He 
gave  up  his  sleep  to  translate  the  Short 
Catechism  for  the  poorest  and  most  illiterate 
of  our  people.     In  committing  the  trans- 


THE    GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


lation  to  the  Council  of  the  Gaelic  Union, 
he  wrote :  "  Having  intended  the  little 
affair  solely  for  the  use  of  unlettered  peo- 
ple, I  object  to  any  words  or  phrases  being 
introduced  into  it  which  are  neither  used  by 
nor  intelligible  to  these  people." 

But  the  censors  introduced  even  into  the 
title  of  the  "  little  affair,''  in  the  first  line  of 
the  title-page,  a  word  that  neither  the  trans- 
lator nor  any  of  his  people  had  ever  heard 
— they  erased  the  word  geÁ^jt,  and  for  it 
they  substituted  the  word  AccomAiji.  The 
two  words  are  synonymous,  but  the  former 
word  is  understood  by  all  who  speak  Irish, 
whereas  the  latter  word  has  not  been 
written  half-a-dozen  times  for  the  last  cen- 
tury and  a-half ;  nor  is  it  spoken  except  in 
one  remote  locality  in  Ireland.  And  why 
make  this  change  ?  The  virtual  censor 
gives  us  the  reasons  in  letters  published  in 
the  Nation  newspaper  over  the  nom  de 
plume  of  "A  Follower  of  Thomas  Davis." 
The  first  reason  he  gives  is  that  "  Many 
words  to  be  found  in  standard  authorities 
....  are  seldom  if  ever  to  be  met  with 
among  the  people."  ..."  English  standard 
writers  do  not  confine  their  vocabulary  to 
words  picked  up  among  the  people."  A 
penny  catechism  intended  solely  for  the 
most  unlettered  of  our  people  must  be 
turned  to  a  work  on  style,  and  this  innova- 
tion is  made,  be  it  remembered,  under  the 
auspices  of  the  censor. 

The  next  reason  is  that  jeA^i  is  a  very 
"inelegant  word"  (sic).  But  is  the  word  a  low 
or  unsuitable  one?  It  was  employed  by 
Father  Donlevy  in  the  Preface  to  the  Paris 
edition  of  his  Catechism,  as  will  be  seen  a 
little  lower  ;  and  it  was  employed  by  Dr. 
Gallagher  in  the  first  line  of  his  first  sermon. 

Now,  since  the  days  of  Keating  we  had 
no  better  writers  of  Irish  than  Dr.  Gallagher 
and  Father  Donlevy.  The  latter  writer 
used  the  word  to  denote  an  abridgment  in 
a  book ;  and  the  term  was  used  by  Dr. 
Gallagher  to  describe  a  prayer  —  and 
what  prayer  ?  The  second  part  of  the 
"  Angelical  Salutation."  And  were  a  better 
word  to  be  found  in  Irish  to  qualify  that 
prayer,  Dr.  Gallagher  would  have  used  it  ; 
and  were  his  "  lips  touched  with  fire,"  he 
could  not  have  found  a  better  word.     And 


this  is  the  word  that  the  "  Follower  of 
Thomas  Davis"  erased,  and  of  which  he 
wrote  in  Extracts  No.  i  and  No.  2  below. 

Extract  No.  1,  from  a  letter  by  a  Follower 
of  Thomas  Davis,  in  the  Nation  of  31st 
July,  1SS6:— 

I  remarked  in  my  first  letter  that  "  AceomAIH  "  was  a 
most  classical  word,  much  preferable  to  geapp,  "  short," 
which  is  a  very  suitable  word  to  apply  to  a  hurley,  but 
very  inelegant  if  used  to  denote  an  abridgment  in  a  book. 
1  >r.  I  tonlevy  did  not  use  it  after  the  adjective,  where  Mr. 
Fleming  would  place  it,  but  he  put  it  before  the  adjective 
(see  Mr.  Fleming's  quotations) ;  but  when  he  wished  a 
word  carrying  the  meaning  of  abridged,  he  took  care  to 
give  AÙcomAi-p  a  position  quite  different  to  that  which  he 
had  assigned  to  50  Ápp. 

Extract  No.  2,  from  a  letter  by  the  Fol- 
lower of  Thomas  Davis,  in  the  Nation  of 
28th  August,  1886:— 

But  Mr.  Fleming  would  not  have  Accotvu\ip,  good  or 
bad.  He  would  have  geÁ^,  though  Dr.  Donlevy  on  this 
point  also  is  as  opposed  to  him  as  the  poles  to  one 
another. 

Extract  No.  3,  from  the  Preface  to  the 
Paris  edition  of  Father  Donlevy's  Cate- 
chism : —

[translation.] 

The  bulk  of  this  Catechism  will,  probably,  at  first  view 
affright  such  as  are  used  only  to  little  abridgments,  merely 
calculated  for  beginners,  and  chiefly  for  children  at  their 
horn-book  or  thereabouts.

And  it  is  interspersed  with  short  forms  of  acts  of  de- 
votion, and  prayers  to  be  used  on  different  occasions. 

This  a  sad  state  of  things  in  holy  Ireland  ! 
The  Follower  of  Thomas  Davis  had  in  his 
hands  and  under  his  eyes  Extracts  No.  3  and 
No.  4,  when  he  penned  Extracts  No.  1  and 
No.  2.  And  yet  he  reckoned  so  confidently 
on  the  ignorance  of  the  readers  of  a  high- 
class  literary  paper,  that  he  was  not  afraid  to 
say  in  black  and  white  that  Father  Donlevy

THE   GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


misrepresented  what  Father  Donlevy  had 
said  in  Extract  No.  4.  In  this  extract  the 
reader  sees  that  Father  Donlevy  translated 
<5.cconn\i]ie  (the  plural  of  <\ccohiai]\)  "  short ;" 
and  that  the  "  Follower  "  says  he  employed 
it  to  convey  the  meaning  of  abridged. 

The  readers  will  observe  that  the  "  Fol- 
lower "  twice  calls  ceo^AfgA,  "  instructions," 
an  adjective.  This  is  certainly  the  first  in- 
stance on  record  of  an  honorary  secretary, 
who  is  also  a  critic,  and  a  censor,  unable  to 
distinguish  the  parts  of  speech. 

Some  scholars  think  the  "  Follower  "  not 
worth  the  trouble  of  holding  him  up ;  ano- 
ther says  :  "  you  pulverized  poor but 

it  was  easy  for  you  ;"  and  another,  "  it  is 
poor  work  for  the  Gaelic  Journal!'  Now 
what  will  these  scholars  say  when  I  assure 
them  that  I  believe  three  out  of  every  four 
readers  of  the  Nation  believed  his  lucubra- 
tions unanswerable,  though  in  all  he  wrote 
in  ten  columns  or  so  of  that  paper,  he  did 
not  make  so  many  bona  fide  statements  ; 
but  a  person  with  a  blackened  face — ajaiij 
yiml — is  not  expected  to  say  what  is  true  ; 
and  what  is  smart  and  insulting  is  sure  to 
carry  those  readers  who  do  not  understand 
the  question  at  issue. 

Let  me  cite  a  couple  more  instances 
to  show  the  extent  of  the  knowledge 
of  the  Irish  language  possessed  by  those 
to  whom  Father  Yorke  committed  Father 
Conway's  little  work  ?  One  of  those 
scholars  in  my  hearing,  and  in  the  hearing 
of  Father  Conway,  said  that  the  original 
manuscript  of  LeAOAji  tiA  h-l1i-ô]ie  was 
written  on  the  skin  of  the  "  11  ròpe  hó  ;" 
and  he  repeated  the  words  on  finding  that 
wc  did  not  notice  them.  And,  strange  as  it 
may  appear,  this  gentleman  has  been  quoted 
as  an  authority  on  Irish  literature  by  a 
continental  scholar,  and  by  a  good  Irish 
scholar  in  a  remote  locality  in  Ireland  ! 
Another  of  these  gentlemen — to  whom,  I 
am  informed,  we  owe  the  term  -dccom<MH  in 
the  title — was  asked  by  a  beginner  in  Irish 
what  was  the  reason  of  the  letter  11  in  is\\ 
«-<\]k\ii,  "  our  bread  ;"  and  to  this  he  could 
make  no  reply. 

The  Short  Catechism  was  translated  by 
a  member  of  the  Council  of  the  Gaelic 
Union.     It  was  passed  through  the  press  by 


other  members  of  the  Gaelic  Union  without 
the  incitements  of  need,  or  greed,  or  praise. 
The  work  was  done  as  unselfishly  as  was  the 
translation  of  the  Kaffir  Catechism  ;  and 
one  paper  only  in  Dublin  would  notice  the 
little  affair. 

Another  member  of  the  Council  of  the 
Gaelic  Union,  the  Rev.  P.  Walshe,  CM.,  at 
his  own  expense,  published  a  second  edition 
of  the  Irish  Imitation  of  Christ — published  it 
at  a  price  that  he  knew  would  never  repay 
him  for  his  outlay.  One  paper  in  Dublin 
noticed  the  work,  though  two  gentlemen 
connected  with  the  Dublin  Press  accepted 
copies  of  the  work,  which  they  promised  to 
review.  Nor  does  the  affair  rest  here. 
The  Most  Rev.  Dr.  Kirby  laid  the  work 
before  the  Holy  Father.  The  following 
letter  tells  the  rest  ;  but  it  does  not  tell  our 
friends  in  Ireland  and  Britain,  and  America, 
that  this  letter  has  not  been,  to  this  day, 
noticed  in  any  paper  in  Dublin  except 
the  Celtic  Times. 

Rome,  lj//i  December,  1S86. 
Rev.  dear  Sir, 

On  yesterday  I  had  the  honour  and  happiness  of  laying 
your  beautiful  edition  of  the  Irish  translation  of  the  Imita- 
tion of  Christ  at  the  feet  of  the  Holy  Father,  which  he  was 
pleased  to  receive  most  cordially.  He  carefully  looked 
over  it,  and  enquired  how  far  the  Irish  language  was  still 
in  use,  and  expressed  his  gratification  that  it  was  still 
spoken  by  a  considerable  number  of  his  Irish  children, 
and  that  a  society  of  learned  Irish  scholars  existed  who 
devoted  themselves  to  the  preservation  and  propagation 
of  this  noble  monument  of  our  country  when  it  was  the 
recogni  ed  domicile  of  saints  and  sages. 

His  Holiness  was  pleased  to  authorize  me  to  send  you 
his  apostolic  benediction,  nnd  the  same  to  the  gentlemen 
who  co-operate  with  you  in  the  above  noble  undertaking. 

I  remain,  with  great  esteem, 

Rev.  dear  Sir, 

Yours  very  sincerely  in  Xt..

Accordingly,  the  important  fact  that 
Leo  XIII.  sent  his  special  benediction  to 
members  of  the  Gaelic  Union  Council  has 
been  suppressed  by  the  Dublin  press.  Put 
this  might  be  expected  when  the  reports  of 
the  meetings  of  the  Gaelic  Union  are  sup- 
pressed in  like  manner. — Ed.  G.  J.

FIND  AND  THE  PHANTOMS. 

Our  readers  will  be  thankful  for  the  importunity  that 
prevailed  on  the  author  of  the  paper  below  to  give  it  for 
insertion  in  the  Gaelic  Journal.  The  paper  is  really  valu- 
able as  a  literary  notice  ;  but  it  is  still  more  valuable  as 
showing  that  a  notice  of  an  Irish  work  can  be  written, 
and  vigorously,  without  any  admixture  of  bitterness  or 
personality.  "Find  and  the  Phantoms  "  is  a  short  baoi 
pAtmuigeACGA  in  the  Book  of  Leinster,  published  with  a 
translation  in  the  Revue  Celtique  by  Mr.  Whitley  Stokes, 
who  was  pronounced  many  years  since,  by  Mr.  Williams 
of  Dungarvan,  as  perhaps  the  best  Celtic  scholar  in  the 
world.  The  language  of  the  little  poem  is  somewhat 
antiquated:  if  put  into  modem  Irish,  any  good  speaker 
of  the  language  would  understand  every  word  and  every 
idiom  in  it  ;  and  yet  this  great  Irish  scholar  fell  into 
several  mistakes  in  Ids  translation  of  it.  Should  not  this 
be  a  lesson  to  every  Irish  scholar  writing  for  scholars — not 
to  believe  that  he  alone  is  infallible,  and  not  to  dip  his 
pen  in  gall  when  noticing  the  works  of  others?  ami  this 
lesson  is  as  needful  to  Mr.  Stokes  as  to  anyone  else. 
Had  he  been  the  reviewer  in  this  case,  he  would  have 
used  the  scalpel  mercilessly — but  would  his  notice  have 
been  more  vigorous  on  that  account  ?  I  think  not.  Ed. 
G.  Journal. 

Dear  Mr.  Fleming, — As  promised,  I  send  you  the 
few  notes  I  had  made  some  time  lack  in  answer  to  your 
queries  on  Whitley  Stokes' translation  of  the  poem  "Find 
and  the  Phantoms,"  from  the  Book  of  Leinster. 

1.  Line  $$.     A^hit  claideb  is  gell  cét. 

<\g  ftro  cLofóeitii  ip  geAbb  (be)  ctvvo. 
W.  S.  translated  this  "There  is  a  sword  the  pledge  of 
hundreds."  Though  geAbb  does  mean  a  pledge,  it  has 
other  meanings  not  found  in  diets,  which  might  be  more 
satisfactory  here,  c.s;.  if  geAbb  beip  é,  ip  geAbb  Le  h-óp 
é,  ir  geAbb  be  cii  é,  &c.  In  none  of  these  examples  does 
geabb  mean  pledge,  but  "  equal,"  "worth,"  "  like,"  any 
of  which  would  be  better  than  pledge  in  the  sentence 
above.  There  is  a  sword  equal  to  hundreds—  worth  hun- 
dreds— like  hundreds  in  destructive  power.  It  is  easy  to 
see  how  the  word  geabb  comes  to  mean  "equal,"  "like." 
inasmuch  as  the  geabb—  pledge  or  deposit — is  given  as  an 
equivalent  of  something  else. 

2.  buideac  é  do  mac  Eoghan  :  line  46. 

bunbeac  é  x>o  (ne?)  mac   eogam,    "Thankful  was 

he  to  Eogan's  son." 

I  am  inclined  to  think  that  this  is  one  of  the  numerous 

instances  to  be  found  in  manuscripts  where  xso  is  written 

instead  of  vs.     Certainly  the  use  of  tjo  after  bui-oeac  is 

not  in  conformity  with  good  usage  in  the  modern  spoken 


or  written  language,  Tie  being  universal  with  correct 
speakers.  CÁ  me  bunJeAC  TJioc,  nofoinc,  is  the  expres- 
sion one  hears  every  day.  TJioc  is  the  personal  pronoun 
cu  in  composition  with  the  preposition  Tie,  whereas  miic 
is  the  same  pronoun  cu  with  the  preposition  t>0.  We 
must  conclude  therefore  that  when  a  noun  is  used  as  in 
the  above  sentence  r>e  is  the  preposition  that  should 
precede  it. 

3.  Bendachais  each  da  chele. 

be.innu15e.yp   cÁò   ■oÁ   céile.     "Each   blessed   the 
other."  (W.  S.) 

The  translation  is  rather,  Each  saluted  the  other.  The 
Irish  equivalent  of  each  blessed  the  other,  isbeAmimgeap 
cÁc  Á  céibe.  x>Á  in  the  text  is  for  xio  a,  and  corresponds 
with  the  compound  pronoun  ■omc  in  the  expression  50 
m-bcMimngfo  tiIa  wine,  which  is  a  usual  form  of  salu- 
tation. The  verb  beAnnujAo  is  used  in  making  the 
salutation,  it  is  also  used  to  name  that  act  of  civility,  con- 
sequently the  words  in  the  text  should  be  translated  : 
"  Each  saluted  the  other."  If  we  wished  to  say — May 
God  bless  them,  we  would  not  say  50  in-beAiimiigi-ò  ■oìa 
tióib,  but  50  m-beAtinuigit>  •OÌA  i<vo.  Besides  the  con- 
text should  make  it  clear  that  it  is  not  a  blessing  that  is 
meant,  but  a  salutation. 

The  following  texts  from  the  Irish  Bible  are  to  the 
point:  Agup  no  beAnmngeAOAp  bo  =  and  they  saluted 
him — Judges  xviii.,  15.  Agup  cÁirnc  Agup  beAnnuig  yé  x>6.

pctniAio,  copgAipio,  gun  puipeAÓ.  He  flays,  he 
destroys,  without  delay  (\V.  S.) 

CopgpAT>  =  destruction  is  given  in  O'Donovan's  supplt. 
to  O  Keilly's  Diet,  with  references  to  passages  in  the 
Annals  of  Ulster,  Tigernagh  and  the  Four  Masters.  At 
A.D.  S25  in  the  Four  Masters  the  words  CopcpAẄ  aoiiaiJ 
CobiiAin,  &c.  occur,  and  O'D.  gives  the  following  foot 
note  on  CopcpA-o. 

"The  Irish  word  copcpAÓ  is  rendered  skirmish  ot 
onset,  in  the  old  translations  of  the  Annals  of  Ulster  ;  but 
the  original  compiler  of  these  Annals  translates  it  by 
destrueto." 

All  this  notwithstanding,  the  rendering  of  the  verb 
cosgraid  in  the  above  passage  seems  too  generic,  for  in 
the  spoken  language  the  word  is  used  to  indicate  the 
manner  of  destruction.  The  verb  copgAipc  usually 
means  to  hack,  to  chop,  to  mangle  ;  c<i  pe  copgApcA  is 
said  of  something  that  is  torn  to  pieces,  hacked,  01 
mangled  ;  so  the  words  of  the  text  would  be  better 
translated  thus: — "He  flays,  he  hacks,  without  delay." 
It  is  indeed  a  very  suitable  word  as  applied  in  the  tale. 

In  the  Battle  ol  Gabhra  the  following  lines  occur : —

5.  Maith  linn  dia  ndama  duinn 

IVIaic  Lmti  oÁ  ti-Bdtiiä  ■ounin.  Well  for  us  if  he 
grant  (life)  to  us  (W.  S.) 

TIIaic  bun  means  literally,  well  (good)  with  us,  i.e.  in 
our  estimation,  and  so  the  phrase  is  used  idiomatically  to 
express  a  wish,  desire,  good  pleasure.  It  never  means 
Viellfor  lis,  which  would  be  in  Irish  niAic  ouinn. 

1p  111A1Ú  bun  gup  ÈÁ1111C  cu,    We  are  glad  you  came. 

If  nuic  Tjiiinn  gup  cÁimc  cu,  It  is  well  forusyou  came. 

The  latter  phrase  is  used  to  signiiy  the  real  utility  of  an 
object,  or  of  an  act  ;  the  former  expresses  our  apprecia- 
tion of  it.  One  might  say  of  something  that  would  be 
good  for  him,  but  which  he  did  not  like,  but)  rh<iic  'ÓAiii 
é,  acc  11  i  111  aic  Liom  é. 

The  difference  between  the -two  phrases  is  so  wide  that 
no  Irish  speaker  would  ever  use  or  mistake  one  for  the 
other.  The  words  bom  and  ■oaiii  are  used  similarly  with 
other  adjectives  also,  thus  ; — 

lp  beAg  bom  é  =  I  consider  it  (too)  little. 

If  bcig  CAin  é  =  It  is  (in  lacl)  (too)  little  for  me.

cient for  me. 


ni  beAg  Liom  Tie.     (I  feel)  I  have  enough  of  it  —  I 
am  satisfied. 
This  last   is  a  common  expression  at  meals  to  signify 
that  one  is  sufficiently  helped  : — 

111  beAg  bom  «e,  go  pAib  111A1É  AgAC  =  I  am  nicely

muccip  ah  ccme  bi  piop.  The  fire  that  lay  below 
was  (is  [?])  quenched  (\Y.  S.) 
Slop  in  this  connection  does  not  indicate  relative  posi- 
tion as  the  translator  seems  to  think  ;  it  means  simply 
"  down  "  in  the  sense  of  "  made  "  or  "  kindled  "  on  the 
health.  (Á)  bi  piop  =  which  was  down,  i.e.,  "  made"  or 
"kindled."  Cuip  piop  cemne  iin\ic  Ann  pni.  Put 
denon  a  good  fire  there:  bi  Ail  cemne  piop  Am'  comne. 
The  fire  was  down  (made)  before  me.*  Tnose  are  every 
day  expressions.  The  use  of  rlie  word  "piop"  comes 
veiy  likely  Irom  the  low  position  of  the  hearth,  which  was 
on  a  level  with  the  floor  ;  its  equivalent  is  also  commonly 
used  by  English  speakers  in  the  same  connection. 

PROFESSOR  ZI.MMER  AND  SOME  OTHERS. 

Second  to  Mr.  Stokes — if  second — both  in  his  know- 
ledge ol  the  Old  and  .Middle  Irish,  and  111  the  severity  of 
his  strictures  on  others  working  in  the  same  field  "1  litera- 
ture— is  the  German  scholar,  Professor  Ziinmer.  1  his 
celebrated  prufessor  visited  Dublin  two  or  three  years 
since,  and  examined  an  Irish  MS.  in  the  Franciscan  Convent, 
Merchant's-quay.  In  this  MS.  there  were  a  number  of 
Tales  of  ponn  iiiac  CurhAllA.  and  of  his  warriors.  The 
tiansciiber  of  the  MS.  at  the  end  of  it  wrote  : 

lllo  iìiaIIacc  ope  a  pinn  ;  My  curse  on  thee,  O  pen  ; 

T)Ap  bun  acaoi  go  h-olc,  In  my  opinion  thou  art  bad, 

tTlAp  11AC  pUAp-Af  cu  pe  gicp,  As  1  did  not  get  thee  to 
mend  ; 

<\cÁ  An  IcAbpAii  pom  go  li-olc  The  little  book  itself 
is  bad. 

i.e.  It  has  suffered  (from  the  badness  of  the  pen). 

Proi  0)  Zimmei  took  this  verse  to  be  Old  Iiish,  and 
wrote  it  thus:  Mo  mhallacht  ort  a  Phinn.  darlind  ataoi 
go  hole  mar  nach  (?)  fuarustu  regies,  ata  an  lebran  lein  go 
Hole. 

yionn  is  a  man's  name,  gen.  A  pinn,  O  Fionn,  or  Fingal. 

peAim  a  pen,  gen.  a  pinn,  O  pen. 

The  Prolessor  thought  that  the  scribe  had  said  "be 
cursed  U  Fingal"  and  that  he  called  the  "MS.  a  bad 
book  ;  "  because  he  (the  scribe)  was  "an  austerely-minded 
friar  [who]  could,  in  a  fit  of  ascetic  zeal,  suffer  himself  to 
be  carried  away  so  far  as  to  use  the  words  '  be  cursed,  O 
Fingal,'  "  e\x. 

In  commenting  on  the  foolish  translation  of  the  passage 
in  Sir  John  Maudeville's  Travels  <G.  J.,  No.  24,  p.  3791, 
I  appealed  to  loreigners  editing  Irish  works,  to  consult 
some  Irish-speaking  scholar  ere  publishing  their  editions 
of  these  works.  I  liis  precaution  is  especially  necessary 
when  the  subject  matter  in  any  way  pertains  to  religion, 
or  to  devotional  practices,  and,  more  especially,  wliere 
the  editor  is  not  ol  the  same  religion  as  the  writer 
of  the  original  work.  The  ridiculous  translation  of 
Mr.  Abercioinby  has  not  yet,  1  believe,  been  corrected 
in  the  Revue  Celtique.  And  how  many  a  laugh  will  be 
raised  m  Germany  at  the  expense  of  the  "  austerely-min- 
ded tnar."  This  account  ot  Prolessor  Zimmer's  mistakes 
I  take  from  a  letter  in  the  Academy  written  by  Standish 
H.  O'Grady.  The  mistakes  of  Messrs.  Stokes  and 
Ziinmer   ougut  to  shame   Irishmen   into  the  learning  of

ing it  as  a  dead  language,  they  see,  does  not  keep  first- 
rate  scholars  from  committing  blunders  at  every  turn. — 
Ed.  G.J. 

P.S. — Since  the  above  was  written,  I  find  that  our  good 
friend,  the  Editor  of  the  Boston  Pilot,  deprecates  the  bitter 
criticism  on  Professor  Zimmer,  from  which  I  took  the 
notice  above,  as  well  as  the  bickerings  of  Irish  scholars  in 
general.  "The  quarrels  of  authors"  are  humil 
whether  the  subject  of  the  bickerings  be  English,  or  Latin, 
or  Greek,  or  Irish  :  and  I  think  the  bitterness  has  not 
been  confined  to  Celtic  literature.  It  would  appear  from 
Mr.  O'Grady's  letter  in  the  Academy,  that  Professor 
Zimmer  had  alluded  to  him  in  very  uncomplimentary 
terms  ;  and  the  learned  Professor  can  do  this  as  well  as 
most  people.  Criticism  on  the  work  of  the  Professor  was 
certainly  justified  :  it  was  more  than  that :  it  was  a  posi- 
tive duty  to  Irish  students — a  duty  that  I  would  do  had  I 
been  acquainted  with  the  German  language.  The  greatest 
difficulty  that  Irish  students  hereafter  will  have  to  contend 
with  is  the  correction  of  the  blunders  and  errors  and  cor- 
ruptions introduced  into  Irish  treatises  during  this  century. 
In  the  MS.  in  the  Franciscan  Convent  that  was  pronounced 
"  bad,"  there  are  some  fifty  or  sixty  of  these  laoice 
pamiuitjeaeca  :  Professor  Zimmer  published  the  first 
line  of  each  of  these  pieces,  with  a  translation,  and  in  the 
three-fourths  of  these  translations,  according  to  Mr. 
O'Grady,  he  is  glaringly  wrong.  Surely,  it  is  the  duty  of 
Irish-speaking  scholars  to  show  these  errors.  Irishmen 
commit  errors  as  well  as  foreigners,  no  doubt  ;  but  no 
Irish  scholar  who  speaks  the  language  would  commit  the 
errors  pointed  out  by  Mr.  O'Grady.  Lately,  in  looking 
through  O'Reilly's  Irish  Writers,  I  found  this  line — being 
the  first  one  of  a  poem  by  Oáibi'ò  ó  topua-oaip — 51Ẅ 
ambpopic  .in  peannaipe  nap  pap  a  gbún  ? — though  ig- 
norant the  flayer,  is  not  his  knee  crooked  ?  The  note  of 
interrogation  and  the  translation  are  O'Reilly's.  Take 
away  the  note  of  interrogation  and  the  translation  will  be : 
"  though  ignorant  the  flayer  that  did  not  bend  his  knee, 
i.e.,  in  prayer  or  at  confession  ;"  and  this  is  what  the  poet 
wrote.  O'Reilly,  unfortunately,  had  no  colloquial  know- 
ledge of  his.  native  tongue  ;  hence  his  many  errors,  in 
spite  of  his  industry.  It  may  be  as  well  here,  as  my  hand 
is  in,  to  point  out  a  line  in  "  Finn  and  the  Phantoms  " 
that  I  forgot  submitting  to  our  learned  correspondent.

To  edit  an  Irish  book,  or  to  write  fairly  in  Irish,  a  per- 
son must  be  an  Irish  scholar,  and  he  must  have  a  collo- 
quial knowledge  of  the  language.  I  suppose  without  this 
colloquial  acquaintance  with  the  language,  a  person  may 
get  a  good  knowledge  of  Irish  in  the  same  way  as  peo- 
ple become  Latin  and  Greek  scholars  by  years  of  close 
study  ;  but  nobody  devotes  these  years  to  the  study  of 
Celtic  Wliit  f  St<  i  5,  Professors  Zimmer  an  i  V 
and  others,  have  studied  the  Old  and  Mi'idle   1 


years,  but  when  they  approach  the  bounds  of  the  Modern 
Irish,  they  are  in  a  fog  ;  we  see  them  floundering  in  it. 
Perhaps  if  we  knew  the  Middle  and  Old  Irish  we  could 
see  them  lost  in  the  fog  too. 

Martin  A.  O'Brennan,  it  is  said,  could  speak  Irish  well. 
He  published  works  on  Irish  literature — one  g 
volume  he  devoted  to  <ii]xe  Slieagam  111  ChonaiLl,  an 
easy  poem  of  a  few  hundred  lines.  One  of  these  lines 
was,  11a  cpí  mupcavoe  ba,  ieabaip,  geuja,  "  the  three 
Murroughs  who  were  long  of  arms  ;"  and  this  he  rendered, 
"  the  three  Murphys  of  oxen,  books  and  groves.''  The 
readers  ofthe  Journal  will  understand  these  blunders.  It 
mentioning  that  O'Brennan  wrote  to  Mr. 
Williams,  of  Dungarvan,  for  the  translation  of  the  line, 
which,  of  course,  he  got  at  once  ;  but  he  preferred  his 
own  rendering.  Such  is  the  work  that  shams  do  in  Irish 
literature  ;  even  when  they  coul.l  get  their  blunders  cor- 
1. out  trouble,  they  put  them  into  print  for  the 
benefit  of  Irish  students,  present  and  future  ! 

Two  or  three  years  since  Professor  Zimmer  was  in 
Dublin — it  was  then  he  examined  the  MS.  in  the  Francis- 
can Convent.  I  was  introduced  to  him,  and  had  he  asked 
me  the  translation  of  these  titles,  I  would  have  set  him 
right  in  as  many  minutes  as  he  has  committed  errors.  On 
the  occasion  of  our  meeting,  the  Professor  repeated  the 
first  and  last  lines  ofthe  stanza  quoted  above,  and  laughed 
at  its  humour,  but  without  any  levity.  He  pronounced 
a  pun  as  distinctly  as  I  would  ;  how  he  could  get  this 
sound  from  a  pinn  is  a. puzzle.  Had  he  repeated  the 
the  whole  stanza,  I  would  of  course  have  detected  the 
mistake  in  a  moment. — Ed.  G.J. 


AX  EXTRACT  FROM  THE  HISTORY 

OF  ED.MOXD  O'CLEARY. 

By  John  O'Xeachtain,  or  Xorton. 


Of    John    O'Xeachtain,    O'Reilly    says, 
"  Irish  Writers,  A.D.  171 5  "  : — 

"John  O'Neachtain,  or  Norton,  lived  at  this  time  in 
the  county  of  Meath,  a  man  much  advanced  in  years. 
He  was  the  author  of  many  original  pieces,  and  translated 
several  others  from  the  Latin  language  into  Irish." 
O'Reilly  gives  the  first  line  of  forty-one  pieces  in  poetry 
l.tam,  the  only  one  of  those  known  to  ordinary 
Irish  readers  is  the  inimil  Laidir,  printed  in 

Hardiman's  "  Irish  Minstrelsy."  The  first  piece  mentioned 
by  O'Reilly,  he  says,  "was  written  shortly  after  the 
Battle  of  the  Buyne,  wiien  the  author  was  deprived  of  all 
his  property  by  the  English  soldiers,  except  one  small 
Irish  book  wiiich  they  left  with  him,  because  they  could 
not  read 

:ilso  gives  the  titles  of  three  pieces  in  prose  by 
O'Neachtain.  Uf  these  the  third — the  forty-fourth  piece 
on  O'Reilly's  list — is  the  History  of  E  imond  O'Clearv, 
from  which  our  extract  is  taken.  O  Reilly  thus  mentions 
it: — "The  History  of  Edmond  O'Cleary,  a  fictitious 
story,  written,  it  would  appear,  for  the  purpose  of  turning 
into  ridicule  persons  learning  the  English  language.  This 
tale  abounds  with  genuine  humour." 

Persons  who  preferred  murdering  the  King's  English 
to  speaking  in  the  language  they  understood,  were  laughed 
a:  by  O'Neachtain  ;  but  he  also  laughed  quietly  at  stingi»

ness,  excessive  drinking,  quarrelling,  •  boasting,  super- 
stition, gaming,  and  the  other  vices  and  follies  of  his  tunc, 
and  of  our  time  too.  The  History  of  O'Cleary  in  brief 
is  this  : — 

Edmund  O'Cleary  was  a  noble  and  magnanimous  prince 
of  the  west  of  Ireland,  devoted  altogether  to  Bacchus 
and  the  Muses.  Before  his  marriage,  his  intended  spouse 
drew  such  a  picture  of  the  giant  and  wicked  magician, 
John  Barleycorn,  called  in  Irish,  Cuinm  SeArdj  1  n--oeine 
{a),  that  he  solemnly  promised  to  have  nothing  to  do  with 
the  necromancer,  either  in  war  or  battle  or  alliance. 
Alter  some  time,  however,  the  fame  of  dnnm  SeA|Vb 
became  a  subject  of  discourse  at  every  fireside  even  in 
Connaught,  so  that  O'Cleary  could  neither  rest  nor  sleep 
until  he  had  come  up  to  Dublin  to  enter  the  lists  against 
the  giant. 

Notwithstanding  the  violation  of  his  solemn  promise  to 
his  wife,  she  came  with  O'Cleary  to  Dublin,  where  he 
encountered  the  treacherous  giant,  first  at  Acaí>  ah 
TJponiA  (A),  now  Thomas-street,  and  again  at  t1e<vo  An 
ein  (c),  now  the  Phoenix.  O'Cleary  performed  prodigies 
of  valour,  but  was  overcome  in  both  encounters  by 
treachery.  After  the  fight  at  tleAT)  An  em,  O'Cleary 
with  his  wife  retreated  to  Athlone,  where  thinking  them- 
selves secure  they  became  remiss;  but  Cui|\m  ScAnb, 
whom  they  thought  in  Dublin,  swooped  upon  them  and 
captured  their  servant,  occ  m-bomn  Iwc  f-tiilcxc  (,;'), 
whose  ears  Cuinm  SeA]\b  cut  off  so  that  the  servant  died. 
Our  extract  begins  at  this  juncture — O'Cleary's  wife,  like 
another  Kate  O'Shanter,  lecturing  him  with  might  and 
main.  They  again  set  out  on  their  retreat,  pursued  by 
Cui|\m  Scvub  through  Roscommon  into  Leitrim.  where  the 
giant  gave  up  the  pursuit,  that  district  being  the  patrimony 
of  his  cousins,  bulcÁn  buAiẅeApCA  (t),  and  Siróẃn  Sia- 
fuiLe-AC,  the  sons  of  Coince.  bulcÁn  met  the  fugitives 
and  invited  them  to  his  inn.  An  account  of  their  enter- 
tainment there  closes  the  extract. 

O'iNeaehtain  was  the  greatest  master  of  the  language 
in  his  time  or  since,  and  his  diction,  in  words  and  idiom, 
comes  nearest  to  what  a  good  Irish  writer  in  Munster 
would  now  employ.  For  this  reason  we  give  the  extract 
as  a  copy  and  model  for  those  students  who  are  trying  to 
acquire  a  good  style  of  composition.  There  are  many 
expressions  peculiar  to  the  western  province  in  the  History  : 
but  these,  as  well  as  all  other  difficulties,  will  be  explained.

first  forms  are  spoken  in  Waterford,  and  the  third 
is  used  there  by  scholars.  CAob  le  is  the  expres- 
sion in  the  West,  i.e.  trusting  to  ;  having  no  other 
fto  depend  on],  Cá  yé  CAob  leip  oe  cloinn;  (-oao-o 
leip  in  Waterford)  ;  he  ha,  no  othei  child  [to  de- 
pend on].  CAob  and  leac  have  the  same  meaning 
of  side  or  part.  The  Rev.  Sidney  Smith  par- 
doned his  enemies,  because  the  more  heartily  he 
forgave  them,  the  more  they  were  salted  in  the 
next  world  ;  such  was  Bulcan's  spirit  above  ;  and 
such  it  is  often  with  those  who  use  these  forms  of 
expression.

literally,  if  you  strike  under  him.  Nothing  can  be 
plainer  to  an  Irish  speaker  than  this  phrase,  but 
it  is  not  so  easy  to  translate  it  into  intelligible  Eng- 
lish :  if  you  meddle  with  him,  attack  him,  insti- 
gate him, — but  always  in  a  bad  sense. 
(16.)  Ap  n-TJorriiiAc  peucpAfo  mé  leip  é,  by  Sunday  I  will

STANZAS 
Taken  down  by  Mr.  Stanton,  of  Friar's  Walk,  Cork,  from 
the  dictation  of  his  neighbour.  Mr.  Sexton.  There 
were  here  a  few  words,  with  their  translation,  that  were 
necessary  to  understand  the  two  stanzas.  The  fir>t 
stanza  was  spoken  by  James  O'Tuomy  to  the  congre- 
gation coming  out  of  tile  chapel,  the  second  to  Johana 
(his  wife,  I  suppose).

The  length  of  my  palm  in  every  big  fellow  of  a  herring, 
And  a  long  respite  for  payment  without  blame. 

The  Instruction  of  James  to  Johana. 
The  congregation  is  coming  and  do  your  business  sensibly, 
Put  down  a  chalk  for  every  niornan  of  drink. 
Give  a  dram  and  a  drink  to  him  you  find  close  in  his

And  do  not  eject  the  man  with  whom  the  habit  is  to  pay.

[translation.] 
THE  FAIR  OF  WINDGAP. 


The  cow  in  calf,  if  not  too  old, 
Was'  surely  dear  enough  there  ; 


THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


45 


And  a  tin  lantern  to  be  got  for  a  shilling-, 
That  would  prevent  you  from  straying  at 
night. 


Bargains — some     cheap,    some     middling, 

some  dear, 
From  fairs  I  see  ever  coming  : 
I  saw  a  grey-headed  sheep  sold 
To  a  swarthy  butcher  for  two-and-sixpence. 
Bill,  Bridget's  son,  parted  with  a  fine  cow, 
He  got  but  three  pound  two  for  her  ; 
But  when  Sheela  came  she  swore  an  oath 
That  he  would  pay  dearly  for  the  roast. 


There  were  neat  brushes,  and  currycombs 

for  horses, 
A  cradle  for  which  a  lullaby  was  composed  ; 
A  wheel  and  spindles,  a  reel  for  twisting, 
A  hive  for  the  swarm  to  lie  in. 
Turnips,  parsnips,  and  red  carrots, 
Black  plums  and  cherries  ; 
The  milk  being  scarce,  there  was  a  struggle 

for  the  onions, 
And  the  housekeepers  scolding  about  them. 


A  dealer  had  herrings  for  sale  in  a  barrel, 
Brave   sprats   were  there,  and  quite  fresh, 

too  ; 
Sloake,  cnis-carrige,  crabs  and  lobsters  ; 
Salmon  and  white  trout  from  the  Suir  there. 
Periwinkles   from   the   sea,  bilberries   in   a 

heap, 
With  gooseberries  in  plenty,  and  apples  ; 
A  flute  for  the  child,  a  small  pitcher  for  the 

nurse, 
And  a  mirror  for  the  eye  to  gaze  in, 


Six  pound  six,  ten  shillings  and  sixpence, 
You  would  not  get  a  calf  without  a  crown 
there. 

For  an  old  heifer  you  could  get  any  price, 
Yearlings  were  not  too  cheap  there  ; 

It  was  not  easy  to  dispose  of  good  horses, 
But  ponies  were  dear,  indeed,  there. 


There  were  great  herds  of  hornless  Kerry 
cows 

From  Mitchelstown,  for  sale  there  ; 
Small,  slight  things  you  would  not  think 

Worth  buying  at  any  price  there. 
For  three  shillings  and    sixpence,    Shawn 
Leun  did  buy 

Two  hornless  middling  heifers  ; 
And  I  pledge  you  my  word,  no  fool  was  he, 

The  deceitful  old  man  that  sold  them. 


Old  crones  were  there,  weak,  without  vigour, 
But  with  tongues  bitingly  garrulous  ; 
They  scolded,  too,  though  only  intent 
On  taking  their  sons  from  the  fierce  fight. 
The  beggars  of  the  country,  the  trick-o'-the- 
loop  men, 

The  card-players  there  shouted  so  lustily  ; 
And   the  gouty  old   man   with    rheumatic 
knee-joints, 

Cursed  away  there  quite  heartily. 


Numbers   without  number   were    there    of 
fish-mongers, 

Having  disposed  of  shoals  of  hake  there  ; 
China  teapots,  sieves  and  riddles, 

And  the  girls  quaffing  wines  there. 
The  Jew's  harp,  you'd  think  it  sweet, 
When  touched  by  the  tip  of  your  finger; 
And  the  pig's  leg  bought  for  a  penny, 
You  would  gnaw  quite  to  the  marrow. 


A  peck  and  forty  of  pease  quite  hot, 
And  a  pint  for  a  halfpenny  from  Sheela  ; 
A  man  with  an  armful  of  cutlasses, 
That  would  cause  staggeens  to  run. 
A  great  bargain,  surely,  for  sixpence  half- 
penny ; 
A  pair  of  suspenders  for  your  trousers  : 


Forty-one  tinkers  came  from  Birr  there, 
Their  donkeys  well  loaded  with  baggage  ; 
Their  wives  and  children,  tin  and  metal, 
And  they  set  up  tents  in  a  hurry  : 
They  soon  had  fires,  with  a  crowd  about 

them, 
Delightful  was  the  blowing  of  their  bellows 

there  : 
But  the  metal   flowed   over  on  some  who 

were  weary, 
And  there  was  shortly  a  fight  on  the  fair.

THE   GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


THE  FAIR  OF  WINDGAP. 

M.  Cavanagh. 

(From  the  Irish  of  Thomas  Mo  ran.) 

VII. 

Cows  (not  too  old)  in  calf,  I'm  told, 

Sold  dear  enough  in  conscience  ; 
Six  pound  sixteen  and  "  half  thirteen  ;" 

Young  calves  a  crown  (that's  nonsense  !) 
The  heifers  aged  were  soon  engaged, 

Grown  calves  were  cheap  to  none  there  ; 
Steeds,  stout  and  well,  were  hard  to  sell, 

But  ponies  held  their  own  there. 


There  aged  crones,  all  skin  and  bones, 

Their  tongues  a  fierce  war  waging  ; 
With  power  of  "jaw"  seek  sons  to  draw 

From  where  the  fight  is  raging. 
There  gamesters  loud  decoy  the  crowd, 

(Half  beggars  and  cut-purses)  ; 
While  o'er  the  clan  one  lame  old  man 

Shrieks  forth  his  awful  curses. 


"  Fish  jolters"  throng  in  crowds  along, 

With  fresh  "  Dungarvan  hake  "  there  ; 
There  ladies  fair  (?)  from  "chaney-ware  " 

A  small  drop  slyly  take  there. 
The  sweet  Jew's  harp  rings  clear  and  sharp, 

When  touched  with  tip  of  finger  ; 
The  cheap  "  criibcen  "  is  picked  quite  clean- - 

O'er  it  they  fondly  linger. 


Peas,  soft  and  hot,  from  four-stone  pot, 

"Old  Sheela  "  sold  unceasing; 
And  whips,  that  plied  on  stageen's  hide, 

Would  set  him  "  Reynard  "  chasing  ; 
For  sixpence  there  you'd  get  a  pair 

Of  braces  for  your  breeches  ; 
A  shilling  white  buys  lantern  bright, 

To  keep  folk  free  from  ditches. 


Of  various  kind,  full  well  I  mind. 

Were  "  bargains  "  at  that  fair  bought ; 

A  grey-faced  sheep  was  sold  dog-cheap, 
(But  half-a-crown  she  there  brought). 


"  Bill  Bride"  will  rue  that  "  three  pound  two" 

He,  for  his  cow,  had  taken  ; 
For  Sheela  swears,  when  "  Bridget  hears 

The  news,  she'll  cook  his  bacon  !" 

XII. 

A  brush  or  comb  you  might  bring  home, 

A  crib  for  babe  to  lie  in  ; 
A  spindle,  reel,  or  spinning-wheel, 

Or  hives  for  bees  to  fly  in  ! 
Fine  garden  roots  and  luscious  fruits  ; 

But  milk  being  rather  scarce  there, 
The  housewives  sought.and  scolding  fought 

For  onions  on  the  trace  there. 

XIII. 

Fresh  sprats,  "  slow/caun,"  hot  "  doolamaun, ' 

Salt  herrings,  cockles,  salmon  ; 
And  Suir's  white  trout,  that  beat  all  out, 

All  fish  from  Foyle  to  Shannon. 
From  field  and  wood  came  berries  good, 

See,  here's  a  flute  for  "  baby  ;" 
A  looking-glass  for  blooming  lass, 

A  jug  for  potheen  (may  bej. 
XIV. 
From  Birr  there  came,  with  ass  and  dame, 

A  score  and  one  of  tinkers  ; 
They  soon  fire-up,  each  swig  a  cup, 

And  then— how  flew  the  clinkers  ! 
The  bellows  blows,  the  "  pot  "  o'erflows, 

The  crowd  (fierce  curses  yelling) 
At  once  "pitch-in,"  all  fight  like  sin — 

So  ends  the  tale  I'm  telling. 

O'CURNAN'S  SONG. 
Gaelic  Journal,  No.  26,  p.  22. 
We  here  present  the  readers  of  the  journal 
with  the  metrical  version  of  this  piece, 
made  by  A.  P.  Graves,  and  with  the  music 
of  it  as  arranged  by  a  master.  It  appears 
that  for  singing  or  playing,  the  stanza  of 
eight  lines  at  p.  22,  should  be  divided  into 
two  stanzas  of  six  lines  each,  thus  : —

O'CURNAN'S    SONG. 

0  Mary,  bawn  asthore, 

That  through  my  bosom's  core 

Hath  pierced  me  past  the  Isle  of  Fodla's   healing  ; 

By  Heaven,  'tis  my  belief 

Had  you  but  known  my  grief, 

Long  since  to  me  with  succour  you'd  been  stealing. 

With  tears  the  night  I  waste, 

No  food  by  day  I  taste, 
But  wander  weak  and  silent  as  a  shadow. 

Ah  !  if  I  may  not  find 

My  Mary  true  and  kind, 
My  mother  soon  must  weep,  a  sonless  widow. 

1  know  not  night  from  day, 

"  Cuckoo,"  the  thrushes  say  ; 
But  can  it  be  May  in  dark  December  ! 

My  friends  look  strange  ami  wild — 

But  hasten,  Mary  mild, 
And  well  my  heart  its  mistress  shall  remember. 

No  herb  or  skill  of  hand 

My  cure  can  now  command — 
From  you,  O  Flower  of  Love,  I'll  seek  it ; 

Then  hasten,  hasten  here, 

My  own  and  only  dear, 
And  in  your  secret  ear  I'll  softly  «peak  it. 


One  sweet  kiss  from  your  mouth 
Would  quench  my  burning  drought, 

And  lift  me  back  to  life  ;  ah,  yield  it  to  me, 
Or  make  for  me  my  bed 
Among  the  mouldering  dead, 

Where  the  winding  worms  may  crawl  and  channel 
through  me. 

Ah  !  better  buried  so. 

Than  like  a  ghost  to  go 
All  music,  dance,  and  sport  with  sighs  forsaking — 

A  witless,  wandering  man, 

For  the  love  of  Mary  bhan, 
With  the  heart  within  my  bosom  slowly  breaking. 


A   SECOND    VERSION    OF    O'CUR- 
NAN'S SONG. 

This  version  has  been  taken  down  by  Mr.  Carmody,  of 
Comeragh  .Mills,  county  of  Waterford,  from  the  dictation 
of  Patrick  Hally,  from  whose  singing  the  music  was 
arranged  by  Miss  Armstrong,  of  Comeragh.  Should  our 
friends  in  other  Irish-speaking  localities  take  like  trouble. 
what  an  amount  of  our  music  and  songs  might  be  pre- 
served !  This  version,  it  will  be  observed,  is  literally  as 
it  is  sung  in  Waterford  ;  in  fact,  I  may  add,  as  Cumin 
himself  sang  it — the  parish  of  Kilrosanty,  where  this  song 
was  taken  down,  being  a  favourite  haunt  with  him.  Mr. 
Carmody  tells  me  that  there  are  two  or  three  old  people 
still  living  there  who  remember  Curnan;  one  of  them,  a 
very  old  woman,  who  was  with  him  for  some  distance 
along  the  road  one  Sunday  coming  from  the  chapel  of 
Kilrosanty.  Any  Irish  song  or  poem,  preserved  orally 
for  eighty  years,  must  have  been  altered  more  or  less  ; 
our  Irish  singers,  being  all  poets,  try  to  improve  the  com- 
positions they  repent ;  still  the  five  first  stanzas  of  this 
piece  have  been  but  little  changed.  The  last  stanza,  I 
suspect,  has  been  added  by  some  other  poet  :  it  is  too 
philosophic  and  too  moralizing  to  be  the  composition  of 
a  maniac.  Young  readers  from  the  other  provinces  will 
notice  these  peculiarities  below. 

Hard  5  is  often  used  in  Munster  for  aspirate  x>  or  5  : 
this  has  been  done  herein  bpeotẁj;,  Stanza  I. ;  pAgaij;, 
Stanza  II.  (pAgAtj;  itself  is  for  pAcpai-ó),  and  clŵoig  and 
TJ1A15,  Stanza  III.  c  for  x>  is  generally  used  in  the  third 
sing.  cond.  mood  ;  it  is  so  employed  here  in  T)'Aicineóc 
and  tj-caj;ac,  Stanza  I.  ;  and  glAcpAÓ,  Stanza  VI.  ;  T>'y&- 
§Ait  Stanza  VI.,  isfor-o'pjgAib  ;  and  Senium:,  Stanza  IV. 
for  Seinni.  tlAip  ha  guirje,  Stanza  III.  ;  t)iTle.Min  UAip 
ha  guiTJe  Ann,  is  a  Waterford  proverb,  i.e.,  in  every 
twenty-four  hours  there  is  a  certain  moment  when  any 
petition  made  at  that  instant  is  granted.  An  old  woman, 
it  is  said,  set  herself  to  pray  for  her  grand-child  :  50  püb 
SeÁgAinin  110.  pig  Aip  eipe.  Having  thus  prayed  for 
nearly  the  full  term,  a  drop  of  soot- rain  fell  on  the  face 
of  SeágAmin  in  the  cradle.  "bAppA  'oeApj;  ope  a  bo- 
CÁ111,"  exclaimed  the  crone  ;  when  swift  as  thought  the 
cabin  was  one  mass  of  flame.  111  Ap  a,  Stanza  III.,  is  the 
Waterford  expression  for  nuinA,  unless.  The  music,  as 
arranged  by  Miss  Armstrong,  appears  to  differ  from  that 
of  the  version  given  at  p.  22,  No.  26  ;  but  1  am  not  a 
judge  on  this  point.  All  I  know  is  that  those  who 
arranged  both  airs  are  equally  well  known  as  first-class 
musicians.

Tin's  author  was  not  a  poet  of  a  high 
order,  but  he  was  a  fair  Irish  scholar,  and 
the  learner  will  find  many  words  in  the  poem 
worth  remembering.  This  is  especially  the 
case  in  the  second  part,  which  will  be  given 
in  our  next  issue.  Learners  should  get  by 
heart  as  much  poetry  as  possible.

*  Art,  the  solitary,  son  of  Conn  of  the  Hundred  Battles, 
was  monarch  of  Erin  from  a.d.  165  to  a.d.  195.  His 
nephew,  Lughaidh  Maccon,  laid  claim  to  the  throne,  but 
was  defeated  in  battle  and  had  to  fly  the  country.  After 
an  absence  of  thirty  years  he  came  back,  with  a  large 
force  of  foreign  auxiliaries,  and  was  met  by  Art  his  uncie, 
at  Magh  Mucruimhe,  near  Athenry,  in  Gahvay  ;  and  here 
one  of  the  most  fratricidal  battles  on  record  was  fought. 
On  the  side  of  the  monarch  there  were  si*  or  seven  of  his 
nephews,  the  step-brothers  of  his  opponent — one  of  them 
being  Owen  More,  the  ancestor  ol  the  Eugenians — they 
all  fell  except  one  or  two,  by  the  hand  of  a  Welsh  or 
British  prince.  On  the  side  of  Maccon  fought  the  cele- 
brated warrior  Lughaidh  Lagha,  the  paternal  uncle  of 
the  brothers  above  mentioned,  by  whose  hand,  according 
to  some  authorities,  the  monarch  Art  was  slain  ;  but  he 
afterwards  felt  sorry  for  the  death  of  his  nephews,  en- 
gaged in  single  combat  with  the  Welsh  prince,  and  slew 
him.  Fionn  mac  Cumhail  and  his  Fianns  should  have 
assisted  the  monarch  in  this  tight — they  being  his  regular 
militia — but  they  retired  the  day  before  the  battle  to  a 
distant  part  of  the  country ;  and   the  king  poured  upon

the  deserters  the  curse  mentioned  in  the  poem.  It  is 
sixty  years  since  1  read  the  tale  narrating  this,  and  my 
recollection  is  somewhat  dim  about  its  details. 

t  Having  exhausted  his  own  stock  of  good  wishes,  the 
poet  now  appeals  for  help  to  his  pastor,  Father  James, 
an  c-Acaip  geal  Seumuf.  In  naming  the  clergy,  the 
people  never  say: — an  c-Afain  paopac,  an  c-Acaip  ó 
llólám.  an  c-Acaip  bpeactiac  :  they  always  say:  an  c- 
Acain  ttilluun  paon  ;  an  c-Acaip  Seagan  6  llolain  ; 
an  c  dcaip  üuniáp  bpe.\cnac  ;  and  their  own  Hocks  and 
friends  say  simply  : — an  c-Acaip  tlilLiatn  ;  an  u-Acaip 
Seagan  ;  an  c-Ataip  üomáp.  The  address  is  :  a  Acaip 
Uilbiam  ;  a  Acaip  Coinap.  To  an  Irish  speaker  an  c- 
Aêaip  6  llobain,  an  c-Aéaip  ó  paolam,  are  barbarous. 

That  word  paoi  which  has  crept  in  a  good  deal  of  late 
was  not  known  to  our  people  at  all  :  they  said  a  •óuuie 
uapail,  a  iimiie  ihumnre  jpẅa,  a  pip  a'  cige,  a  buacailb 
Ó15,  a  111I1  Aippnp,  a  Chijeapna.  And  they  called  one 
another  and  addressed  e.ich  otlier  by  their  own  names  : 
Comap  ó  p'aolain,  A  Choniatp  tn  piiaobam  ;  neighbours 
and   persons  very  intimate  said   generally  the  Christian

We  would  gladly  hear  from  the  different  localities 
throughout  the  Irish-speaking  districts,  how  far  have  the 
old  forms  been  preserved  ;  and  also  the  opinion  of  our 
correspondents  as  to  the  advisability  of  preserving  them 
or  restoring  them  where  innovations  have  been  introduced. 
Can  any  correspondent  give  any  details  as  to  the  poet — 
what  was  he  ?  Where  did  he  reside  ?  I  would  take  him 
to  be  of  East  Munster.  There  are  poets  of  the  name  of 
Carey  named  by  him — anything  known  of  these.  Darby 
Ryan  is  remembered  as  the  author  of  the  "  Peeler  and 
the  Goat."  I  have  always  heard  of  him  as  of  Bansha,  Tip- 
perary,  not  Galbally,  of  Limerick.  Darby  Ryan  com- 
posed other  pieces  too  ;  one  stanza  I  recollect,  describing 
some  fashionable  ladies  of  his  time  :

were  at  every  wake  for  the  persons  coming  to  watch  or 
visit ;  to  be  without  them  at  the  date  of  the  poem  were  a 
shame  and  a  disgrace.

TO   THE    READERS    OF    THE    GAELIC 
JOURNAL. 

A  little  more  than  twelve  months  since  there  appeared 
in  the  Irish  American  newspaper  what  purported  to  be 
an  address  in  the  Irish  language  from  Mr.  Thomas 
O'Neill  Russell.  In  this  address  he  slated  that  he  had 
been  induced  by  somebody  to  waste  a  day  or  two  in  read- 
ing the  "  Pious  Miscellany  "  of  C.VÓ5  jaoLaô  (Timothy  the 
Irish  and  the  Catholic) ;  and  that  the  greatest  service  a 
person  could  do  the  tongue  of  the  Gael  would  be  to  buy 
up  all  the  copies  of  this  work  extant  and  consign  them  to 
the  flames  or  to  the  depths  of  the  sea.  To  prove  his 
assertion  he  quoted  a  line  from  the  "  Pious  Miscellany," 
which  he  said  contained  four  errors  ;  and  that  the  way 
to  compute  the  number  of  errors  in  the  book  would  be  to 
multiply  the  number  of  lines  in  it  by  four  for  the  total 
number  of  errors  in  it. 

Now,  Timothy  Sullivan  was  a  classical  as  well  as  an 
Irish  scholar.  He  was  a  poet  of  a  high  order  ;  his  fault 
as  a  poet  was  the  fault  of  his  age.  lie  indulged  occasion- 
ally in  hard  words ;  but  some  of  his  simple  melodies  are 
as  sweet  as  any  in  the  language.  His  friend  Tjom1c.1t> 
fttuvo,  the  author  of  the  "  Fair  Hills  of  Erin,"  in  his  hun- 
dredth year,  wrote  an  epitaph  for  him  in  Latin  verse, 
which  has  been  translated  into  metrical  English  by  Dr. 
Sigerson,  and  versified  in  Irish  by  Thomas  Flannery. 
James  Scurry,  the  best  Irish  scholar  of  his  day,  had  an 
equally  high  opinion  of  Cvó;;  Jaolac.  I  believe  it  is  hardly 
an  exaggeration  to  say  that,  until  the  potato  blight  had 
scattered  the  Irish-speaking  population  of  Munster,  Caw;; 
Saobac  was  as  much  loved  and  venerated  in  the  South 
of  Ireland  as  Burns  was  in  the  Highlands.  And  this 
is  the  man  whom  Mr.  O'Neill  Russell  took  upon  him- 
self to  revile.  At  the  time  I  wrote  a  letter  on  the 
subject  of  this  criticism  to  send  to  the  editor  of  the 
Irish  Atnerican /  but  so  unwilling  was  I  to  come  in 
contact  with  Mr.  Russell,  that  I  did  not  send  it.  The 
line  upon  which  the  calculation  was  made  by  Mr. 
Russell  is  : — 

An  melt)  fin  t>o  TjalXaj;,  x>o  caocaj,  tjo  meatbág. 

That  number  who  were  dazed,  who  were  blinded,  who 
were  deceived. 

Now  in  this  line  there  is  not  a  single  error.  It  is  com- 
posed in  the  Munster  dialect,  and  the  three  verbs  are  in 
the  passive  voice,  past  tense  :  and  no  matter  how  speded, 
any  Munster  reader  or  speaker  would  pronounce  them  as 
they  are  written  above.  The  truth  is  that  there  are  but 
very  few  lines  in  the  "  Pious  Miscellany  "  in  which  Mr. 
Russell  could  find  a  fault  to  point  out. 

And,  it  may  be  asked,  why  come  in  contact  with  Mr. 
Russell  now,  after  giving  him  a  wide  benh  for  the  last 
twelve  months  ?  There  is  no  escaping  Mr.  Russell 
this  time.  He  has  addressed  to  me  in  the  Irish  American 
an  open  letter  finding  fault  with  an  expression  in  the  Irish 
sermons  now  being  published  in  the  Gaelic  Journal ;  and 
"this  open  letter  lor  more  than  a  week  ere  I  saw  it  was 


being  exhibited  in  a  certain  luer..ry  institution  in  I  lublin 
by  one  of  the  officials  there — an  official  who  has  for  a 
long  time  been  holding  forth  that  nobody  but  fishwomen 
now  speak  Irish.  This  doctrine  is  being  preached  for  a 
purpose  ;  and  Mr.  Russell's  letter  has  been  gladly  laid 
hold  onto  help  this  purpose;  whether  Mr.  Russell  so 
intended  it,    I  will  not  take  upon  rmseif  to  say. 

A  person  may  say  in  English,  "  this  is  the  man  whom 
I  got  the  book  from,'"  or  "  this  is  the  man  from  whom  I 
got  the  bock."  Writers  as  a  rule  prefer  the  first  form  of 
expression,  and  employ  it;  and,  on  the  other  hand, 
grammarians  condemn  it.  Similarly  there  are  two  ways 
of  saying  in  Irish,  "  She  went  to  sell  honey  "  : — cuaifj  fi 
cum  1111L  xio  •öíol,  or  cuai-o  fi  cum  meaba  x>o  ■ói'oL. 
Four  years  ago,  in  November,  1883,  Mr.  Russell  attacked 
the  Gaelic  Journal  on  this  point,  asserting  that  the 
former  expression  was  wrong.  I  was  about  taking  the 
editorship  in  hands  at  the  time,  and  I  showed  him  lhat 
there  were  equally  good  authorities  for  both  expressions  ; 
for  instance,  Mr.  Williams,  of  Dungarvan,  for  the  one, 
and  Father  Donlevy  for  the  other.  I  pointed  out 
that  one  of  the  expressions  was  ungrammatical,  and 
quoted  O'Doiiovau's  grammar  to  this  effect  ;  but 
O'Donovan  added,  as  I  had  done,  th;  t  either  form  might 
be  used.  This  reply  I  gave  in  the  journal  at  p.  141, 
No.  17  ;  and  as  Mr.  Russell  had  been  always  saying  how 
thankiul  he  would  be  to  any  person  that  would  point  out 
any  corrections  required  in  his  writings,  I  thought  he  was  in 
earnest,  and  drew  his  attention  to  some  ten  places  or  so 
in  his  last  letter  lhat  would  be  the  better  of  a  little  looking 
after.  The  note  in  which  I  pointed  out  his  errors,  I  will 
give  by-and-by,  and  you  will  see  that  it  was  impossible  to 
point  out  errors  in  milder  language.  The  other  blunders  in 
his  letter  Mr.  Russell  passed  over,and  during  the  four  years 
that  have  since  elapsed,  he  has  devoted  all  his  attention  to 
reading  the  Itish  Bible,  Donlevy 's  Catechism,  the  l.ucerna 
Fidebum,  &c.:,  &c,  looking  out  for  authorities  to  show 
lh.it  cum  meala  -oo  tnoL  and  the  kindred  expressions  are 
the  only  correct  ones.  In  this,  of  course,  he  was  justified, 
if  he  believed  himself  right  ;  but  he  was  not  justified 
in  stepping  outside  the  truth.  F'or  instance,  he  makes 
O'Donovan  say  that  this  form  of  expression  is  the  correct 
one,  whereas,  as  was  said,  O'Donovan  laid  down  as  a 
rule  quite  the  contrary.  Mr.  Russell,  no  doubt,  fenced 
very  cleverly,  to  throw  dust  into  the  eyes  of  people  who  are 
not  Irish  scholars,  and,  unfortunately,  Irish  scholars  are 
very  few.  But,  after  all,  it  is  a  wonder  how  he  had  the 
courage  to  write  the  following  : — 

"  Most  writers  of  Irish  grammars  have  laid  it  down  as 
a  rule  that  cum  governs  the  genitive.  O'Donovan,  Joyce, 
and  Windisch  (and  they  are  considered  the  best),  cer- 
tainly so  ;  they  say  nothing  about  exceptions  to  this  rule, 
and  it  is  to  be  presumed  because  there  are  no  exceptions." 
And  in  another  place  he  says  of  the  rule,  "that  no  one 
but  some  one  of  little  learning  and  great  '  brass '  has  ever 
dared  to  dispute  it." 

On  the  other  I  assert,  in  the  first  place,  that  no  writer 
on  Irish  grammar  ever  said  or  implied,  directly  or  in- 
directly, that  cum  governs  the  gen.  case  of  a  noun  which 
goes  before  a  verb  transitive  in  the  infinitive  mood,  as 
in  the  phrase  given  above,  cum  meala  -oo  TJiob;  and  all 
the  contention,  be  it  remembered,  is  about  such  expres- 
sions only  .  though  Mr.  Russell  so  expressed  himself  as 
to  put  this  distinction  out  of  sight. 

In  the  next  place,  I  assert  that  Dr.  O'Donovan  says 
quite  the  contrary  of  what  Mr.  Russell  would  have  us 
believe.  At  p.  385  of  his  Irish  Grammar.  O'Donovan 
says,  "Sometimes  when  the  prefixed  object  of  the  infra. 
mood  is  preceded  by  a  preposition,  some  writers  make 
it  the  dative  or  ablative  governed  by  the  preposition,  as.

As  if  he  hail  a  presentment  of  what  ''some  one  of  little 
learning  and  great  'brass'"  would  say  in  after  ages,  I  >r. 
O'Donovan  goes  on,  quoting  the  grammarian  whom  he 
most  highly  respected,  in  opposition  to  Mr.  Russell's 
assertion: 

"  Stewart  agrees  with  this  opinion  in  his  Gaelic  Gram- 
mar, p.  175,  where  he  writes,  '  Prepositions  are  often  pre- 
fixed to  a  clause  of  a  sentence;  and  then  they  have  no 
regimen,  as  '  Luath  chum  fuil  a  dhortadh,  swift  to  shed 
blood,'  Rom.  III.,  15."  Does  Mr.  Russell  understand 
this  ?  Dr.  O'Donovan  quotes,  as  his  own,  and  adopts  the 
rule  of  the  grammarian  who  said  that  cum  "has  no  regi- 
men," does  not  govern  a  noun  in  the  gen.  case,  in  such 
phrases  as  the  above,  i.e.  ,  when  cum  is  followed  by  a  noun, 
the  object  of  the  infin.  mood  after  it. 

In  the  "  open  letter  "  he  tells  me  that,  "  Not  only  in 
the  Irish  sermon  given  in  the  Gaelic  Journal,  but  in 
almost  all  the  issues  of  it  that  have  been  brought  out 
since  you  began  to  edit  it,  many  instances  can  be  found  in 
which  cum  is  found  with  the  nominative  and  accusative. 
Now,  without  wishing  to  be  captious,  and  without  in  any 
way  desiring  to  offend  you,  permit  me  to  say  that  you 
should  take  some  notice  of  this  matter  in  the  next  issue 
of  the  Gaelic  Journal.  No  one  need  be  ashamed  of 
having  made  a  mistake  in  Irish."  &c,  &c. 

When  dealing  with  Mr.  Russell, I  should  now  be  wonder- 
proof.  I  never  to  my  knowledge  used  a  nom.  or  accusa- 
tive after  cum,  except  when  followed  by  a  verb  in  the 
infin.  mood,  and  it  would  be  more  to  the  point  if  Mr. 
Russell  had  made  a  list  ol  these  instances. 

As  to  the  preacher  of  the  sermon,  he  heard  Irish  in  the 
cradle  ;  he  learned  to  read  and  write  Irish — in  fact,  he 
studied  it  grammatically — in  early  boyhood.  With  the 
exception  of  Mr.  Flannery,  I  do  not  know  now  a  better 
modern  Irish  scholar,  living.  He  is,  moreover,  a  man  of 
clear  and  acute  intellect,  and  a  very  ripe  scholar ;  he  is  a 
great  authority  in  himself.  As  a  writer,  Father  Donlevy 
had  very  few  equals,  but  Mr.  Williams  was  certainly  his 
equal  in  his  knowledge  of  Irish  grammar. 

I  expect  Mr.  Russell  will  not  again  claim  John 
O'Donovan  on  his  side  ;  and  he  was  not  a  man  of  "  little 
learning  and  great  brass." 

Father  Smiddy,  of  the  diocese  of  Cloyne,  when  revising 
the  catechism  of  that  diocese  for  Dr.  Keane,  made  use  of 
the  "  brass  "  expression.  And  in  the  Irish  grammar  com- 
piled for  the  General  Assembly  of  Ireland,  by  S.  O'til., 
at  p.  97,  we  find  "  cat  m  c  ré  cum  an  peap  a  bualaẅ,  he 
came  in  order  or  with  intent  to  strike  the  man.  buataẅ 
is  a  verb,  and  governs  peap  in  the  accusative  case.''  Dr. 
Stewart's  opinion,  as  adopted  by  O'Donovan,  we  have  seen 
already. 

In  translating  cnompa  na  b-plaiceap  into  Irish  (from 
the  French,  I  believe),  a  Friar  wdio  had  no  vanity  to 
gratify,  in  his  cell  in  Cork,  used  both  forms  in  one  pas-

Any  one  of  these  authorities  I  have  cited  would  teach 
Mr.  Russell  Irish  till  he  goes  to  his  long  home,  unless  Mr. 
Russell  goes  for  years  to  learn  patois  in  an  Irish-speaking 
locality  in  the  west  or  south  of  Ireland.  Mr.  Russell  is 
not  an  Irish  scholar  at  ail.  In  his  life  he  has  not  written  or 
spoken  half  a  dozen  consecutive  sentences  in  Irish  cor- 
rectly. Nor  is  he  improving.  In  his  little  letter  to  the 
Celtic  Times  the  other  day,  I  heard  as  many  corrections  in 
it  made,  and  not  by  me,  as  are  in  the  note  at  p.  141 
mentioned  above.  Mere  is  this  note,  commenting,  be  it 
remembered,  on  Mr.  Russell's  letter  of  November,  1S83. 
I  wrote  (1.)  "In  the  quotation  which  he  gives  from  a 
former  letter  of  his,  at  top  he  says  :  *  Tabhair  cead  dam 
le  radh  ;'  le,  as  a  sign  of  the  infinitive  is  used  when  the 
active  verb  has  a  passive  signification,  or  when  it  signifies 
purpose  or  intention.  Tabhair  cead  dam  a  radh,  or  e  do 
radh,  should  be  used  here."  (2.)  "  Ni  amhain,"a  little 
lower,  would  lie  better  if  written,  "  ni  h-e  amhain  ;"  (3.) 
"Do  dheanadh  dham-sa  is  hardly  applicable,  except  where 
a  favour  of  some  kind  is  conferred  ;  do  dheanadh  liom-sa, 
or  orm-sa,  is  better  where  criticisms  or  any  such  things  are 
the  subject  ;"  (4.)  "  Acht  iarraim  ortha  d'a  dheunadh." 
Deunadh  is  either  a  verbal  noun  or  a  verb  in  the  infinitive 
mood  ;  if  the  former,  the  poss.  pronoun  a  should  be 
used  ;  or,  if  the  latter,  e  do  [dheunadh]  ;  iarraim  ortha  a 
dheunadh,  or  e  do  dheunadh.  See  O'Don.  Gr.,  p.  384; 
(5.)  "  Chum  lochda  iVfaghail leat-sa"  third  line  of  letter 
proper.  I  cannot  recollect  ever  seeing  or  hearing  la's  used 
after  lochd  ;  lochd  d'faghail  air  is  the  idiom  so  far  as  I  am 
aware.  The  phrase,  "  Chum  lochda  d'faghail  "  may  be 
used  to  discuss  what  Mr.  Russell  speaks  of  at  some  length 
somewhat  further  on  in  his  letter  ;  that  is  the  case  after 
the  compound  prep,  chum.  It  is  a  fact  that  all  gram- 
marians agree  that  chum  is  followed  by  a  gen.  ;  and  all 
philosophers  agree  that  a  body  in  motion  goes  in  the  direc- 
tion of  the  lorce  that  puts  it  in  motion  ;  but  should  a  force 
greater  than  the  first,  and  in  the  opposite  direction,  be 
brought  to  act  upon  it.  the  body  will  be  turned  backwards. 
Similarly,  when  chum  with  a  noun  goes  before  a  verb  in 
the  infinitive  mood,  the  gen.  after  chum  should  be  changed 
to  the  ace,  because  the  "  inf.  mood  of  active  verbs  takes 
the  ace.  when  the  noun  is  placed  before  it."  O'Kon.  Ir. 
Gr.,  rule  35.  O'Donovan,  too,  at  foot  ot  p.  385,  in  treating 
of  cases  where  a  prep,  and  a  noun  go  before  a  verb  in  the 
infin.  mood,  says  :  "It  would  be  obviously  better  to  have 
the  noun  under  the  government  of  the  inhn.  mood,  as  it 
would  be  in  the  absence  of  the  prep.,  and  consider  the 
prep,  as  governing  the  clause  of  the  sentence  which  fol- 
lows it."  Nothing  can  be  plainer  than  this"  Chuaidhsi  go  d-ti 
an  aonach  chum  ba  (cows)  do  cheannach  ;  "  it  is  not  chum 
bo,  he  went  to  the  fair,  but  to  buy  cows — ba  do  cheannach. 
"  Chum  fear  do  phosadh  "  is  not  to  marry  men,  but  to 
marry  a  man  :  fear  being  the  accus.  sing,  before  do 
phosadh,  not  the  gen.  plur.  In  the  meantime,  it  must 
be  said  that  the  authorities  are  equally  good  in  favour  of 
both  constructions — Williams  and  Donlevy,  for  instance. 
The  one  says  "chum  an  bheatha  shiorruidhe  do  shao- 
thrughadh,"  and  the  other,  "chum  na  beatha  siorruidhe 
do  shaolhrughadh."  The  correct  form,  doubtless,  is,  in 
such  constructions,  toput  the  noun  after  chum  in  the  accu-  „fs^J 
sative,  and  to  take  the  whole  phrase  as  governed  by  chum. 

Another  error  can  be  corrected  by  the  example  given 
above,  "  go  d-ti  an  aonach,"  &c.  Go  d-ti  is  a  simple  prep., 
and  like  nearly  all  such  prepositions,  it  eclipses  the  noun 
after  it  when  declined  with  the  article  ;  (6.)  "  Go  d-ti  an

Should  Mr.  Russell,  even  yet,  be  able  to  find  in  any 
good  writer  expressions  similar  to  those  found  fault  with 
in  the  note  above,  they  will  be  admitted  into  the  Gaelic 
Journal,  and  welcome.  And  though  he  should  fail  in  find- 
ing a  single  such  passage — as  I  believe  he  will  fail — the 
search  for  a  couple  of  years  will  form  a  most  healthful 
exercise.  But  should  he  succeed,  no  one  will  rejoice  more 
than  I  shall.  In  the  Journal,  No.  9,  p.  294,  I  wrote,  "A 
word  in  reply  to  Mr.  O'Neill  Russell,  the  gentleman,  by 
the  way,  of  all  connected  with  our  movement,  with  whom 
I  would  rather  be  at  one."  My  predecessor  in  the 
editorship  of  the  journal  was  still  more  attached  to 
Mr.  Russell.  In  his  first  number,  at  p.  20,  he 
said :  "  There  are  few,  indeed,  who  have  laboured 
for  the  cause  of  the  Irish  language  so  earnestly 
unselfishly,  and  ably,  as  lias  Thomas  O'Neill  Russell  for 
the  past  twenty  years.  We  are  glad  to  see  he  lias  not  yet 
wearied  of  well  doing,  and  it  is  a  source  of  great  gratifica- 
tion to  us  that  his  name  appears  among  the  coniributors 
to  our  first  number."  This  friendly  feeling,  however, had 
to  give  way  under  the  reiterated  insults  of  Mr.  Russell, 
and  this  last  notice  of  Mr.  Comyn  on  the  letter  of  Mr. 
Russell,  dated  September,  1S83,  was  penned  in  a  mood 
very  different  from  that  in  which  he  penned  the  passage 
above.     This  note  is  at  p.  292,  No.  9  of  the  Journal. 

"  We  have  been  very  careful  to  print  this  and  other  re- 
cent letters  of  his  verbatim  et  literatim,  as  they  appear  in 
Mr.  Russell's  MSS.  We  are  consequently  surprised  that 
he  should  still  find  fault  with  our  action.  When  we,  with 
his  own  permission,  made  certain  changes  in  previous  con- 
tributions, he  objected  ;  now  when  we  refrain  from  doing 
anything  of  the  kind,  he  is  not  pleased.  We  have  care- 
fully examined  the  manuscript  of  his  letter  (which  he  says 
we  printed  so  incorrectly),  and  we  find  that  every  one  of  the 
errors  he  points  out  appears  in  his  handwriting,  except  the 
omission,  by  oversight,  of  one  letter  in  the  word  dear  mad. .  . 
We  would  ask  Mr.  Russell  to  read  again  our  notes  at  pp. 
20.  172,  191,  225,  265,  &c.  .  .  .  The  letter  concern- 
ing the  quotation  from  the  Book  of  Leinster,  if  it  reached 
us,  must  have  been  mislaid." 

As  in  Mr.  Comyn's  case,  Mr.  O'Neill  Russell  asks  me 
for  some  MS.  copied  from  the  Book  of  Leinster.  I  have 
no  recollection  of  having  ever  seen  this  M.S.  I  am  quite 
certain  of  one  thing,  that  I  never  looked  into  it. 

Now  I  would  ask  Mr.  Russell,  should  he  not  distrust  the 
temper  that  made  him  fall  out  with  so  many  friends  at 
both  sides  of  the  Atlantic.  At  this  side  of  the  Ocean, 
our  text-books  are  being  corrupted,  and  even  our  cate- 
chisms. On  our  tomb-stones  a  barbarous  Irish  jargon  is 
being  cut ;  and  Mr.  O'Neill  Russell  is  silent.  But  when 
a  preacher  once  or  twice  uses  a  grammatical  expression, 
Mr.  Russell  fills  a  long  column  with  ungrammatical,  but 
euphonious  quotations  to  show  the  ignorant  that  the 
preacher  was  not  correct. 

Our  readers  may  think  it  strange  that  so  many  good 
writers  should  write  bad  grammar,  for  it  amounts  to  this  : 
Great  masters  of  style  in  all  languages  look  more  to 
euphony  than  to  strict  grammar ;  this  was  especially  the 


case  with  our  best  Irish  «liters.  In  the  example  I  gave 
before,  cum  meoXA  no  wok,  is  thought  more  euphonious 
than  cum  nub  T>o  wot.  All  grammarians,  and  all  late 
writers,  except  Mr.  O'Neill  Russell,  prefer  the  strict  gram- 
mar, but  out  of  respect  for  the  great  writers,  they  allow 
both  forms  of  expression.  Another  instance  of  ungram- 
matical euphony  is  "ion  n-ouine,"  one  man.  Nothing 
could  be  more  ungrammatical,  and  yet  Dr.  Gallagher 
writes  the  phrase  three  times  in  one  page,  and  Dr. 
Keating  also  uses  the  expression  in  the  preface  to  his 
History.- Ed.  G.J. 

Notice — The  Rev.  E.D.  Cleaver  requests  the  "  teachers 
of  Irish  in  Donegal,  Mayo,  Galway,  Clare,  Kirry,  Cork, 
and  Waterford,  to  send  to  him  at  the  Reciory,  Bray,  Co. 
Wicklow,  a  statement  of  the  numbers  presen'ed  and  passe  1 
in  Irish  in  1SS7,"  in  their  respective  schools.  Teachers 
are  already  aware  that  the  returns  are  to  be  certified  by 
their  managers,  the  regulations  for  the  prizes  having 
already  more  than  once  been  published  in  the  Gaelic 
Journal. 


THE    IRISH    TITLE    OF    THE    SHORT 
CATECHISM. 


In  support  o(  any  change  made  in  this  "  little  affair," 
after  the  Gaelic  Union  had  resigned  it  to  the  publisher, 
there  was  one,  and  only  one,  rule  of  grammar  cited  that 
could  lead  even  a  schoolboy  astray.  But  the  Gaelic 
Journal,  from  its  first  number,  was  intended  to  be  a  help 
to  students  of  all  grades  ;  and  though  the  rule  referred  to 
above  would  not  impose  on  many,  it  may  be  belter  to  ex- 
plain it  for  the  sake  even  of  the  few.  It  is  rule  4,  at 
p.  101,  of  Dr.  Joyce's  Grammar,  and  it  says:  "  When  a 
name  consists  of  two  words,  the  adjective  comes  between 
them  ;  as  Sbab  <\óbjl  móf\  Luâcpá — the  tremendous 
large  Slieve  Lougher.  eaniuin  thin,  aUnnn  nu\c..\ — 
the  smooth,  beautiful  Eman  Madia."  Now,  to  any  per- 
son fairly  capable  of  seeing  the  distinction  between  a 
common  noun  and  a  proper  name,  it  is  as  plain  as  print 
that  the  rule  refers  to  this  latter  class.  Every  Irish 
reader  will  recollect  seeing  the  adjective  so  placed  in  all 
our  tales,  and  in  songs  and  poems,  as,  aip  Shlub  j;e.ib 
5-Cuá — in  bright  Slieve  g-Cua  ;  roi|\  cUiiin  5e.1l  lllejl^ 
agtlf  Cafpiig  na  Siutrie — between  bright  Cluain  Meala 
and  Carrick-on-Suir  ;  but  no  one  ever  thrust  it  between  the 
two  parts  of  a  common  noun  like  ue-vj-sy;;  Crdopciije 
(Christian  doctrine),  until  somebody  tried  his  "'prentke 
hand,"  and  thrust  in  <iccom<M]\  between  them  in  the  title 
of  the  Short  Catechism — UeAgcvr-i;  <\ccom<vin  CpoircAige. 
Everyone  now  can  try  experiments  on  the  vile  thing  that 
was  once  the  "  tongue  of  the  saints  and  the  sages." 

Readers,  look  back  again  at  the  adjectives  above  ;  you 
see  they  are  not  in  any  instance  part  of  the  proper  place- 
name  ;  they  may  be  omitted  and  the  name  remains  intact — ■ 
Slieve  Lougher,  Eman  Macha,  Slieve  g-Cua,  Cluain 
Meala.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the  name  Suji-o  ui 
Chonn.iillVl<iccAp..\c  ;  biile  Chotruvir'loccapac;  b^ile 
ah  phaoicig  be^s  ;  (6>/i?>-0'Connell-street,  Lowei  B.diy- 
thomas,  Little  Whitestown,)  the  adjective  in  every  case  is 
a  fixed  part  of  the  name,  and  the  omission  of  it  would 
leave  the  name  incomplete.  Such  adjectives,  the  dis- 
tinguishing parts  of  the  name,  are  never  placed  between 
the  two  parts  of  it.  Nobody  but  a  "'prentice  hand,  ' 
then,  would  write  pnifo  Ujc-oawac  tji  ChonailL  Dr. 
Keating,  for  instance,  wrote  :  -oeic  m-bl.A-óni  picioo  ó

the  battle  of  North  Moytura. — Joyce's  Keating,  pp.  120 
and  121. 

Learners  should  be  told,  perhaps,  that  a  noun  in  the 
gen.  case  often  supplies  ihe  place  of  an  adj.,  and  notably 
in  place-names.  Dublin,  for  instance,  is  At  CtiAC 
TJmbbime — the  ford  of  the  hurdles  o!  (at)  the  black- 
pool.  This,  in  a  'prentice  hand,  would  be  At  Ouibbnine 
Cbai— the  ford  of  the  blackpool  of  the  hurdles,  and 
columns  of  our  newspapers  might  be  filled  showing  the 
propriety  of  the  alteration — Keating  and  all  our  authors 
since  OlXaiii  yoòla  notwithstanding;  but  our  fathers  knew 
the  idioms  of  the  language.  Even  in  the  most  minute 
local  subdivisions  they  followed  the  same  rule.  Mr.  P. 
O'Brien  informs  me  that  a  field  in  his  native  place,  in  the 
■western  extremity  of  Cork,  was,  in  his  lime,  divided  into 
piáipc  na  li-AbAnn  voccAip  and  pounc  na  h-abann  «Ac- 
Clip — the  river-field,  upper  and  lower.  This  present 
summer  the  owner  of  the  field  was  in  Dublin,  and  he 
said  that  the  field  is  still  called  by  the  old  names. 

Our  readers  will  recollect  the  name  of  Mr.  Stanton,  of 
Friar's-walk,  Cork.  On  the  19th  of  January  la-.t  he  sent 
us,  for  the  Journal,  the  two  stanzas  below,  which  he  took 
down  from  the  dictation  of  another  friend  of  ours,  Mr. 
Sexton,  his  neighbour.  They  both,  like  so  many  others 
of  our  friends,  believed  we  had  gone  the  way  of  all  Irish 
periodicals.  Celtic  tenacity  should  be  a  quantity  taken 
into  account  in  all  our  calculations.  Mr.  Stanton,  no 
doubt,  has  a  câorae  ready  to  chaunt  for  the  Gaelic 
/oiirna! ;  but  our  readers  will  hear  from  him  many  a 
lively  strain  before  the  publication  of  the  sad  composition. 
While  the  penal  laws  were  in  full  force,  Dr.  Gallagher 
tells  us,  there  were  amongst  the  people  living  on  them, 
and  living  sumptuously  too,  while  those  who  feted  them 
were  themselves  steeped  in  poverty — nuagaini'óe  peaca, 
vagabond  outlaws,  i.e.,  pretended  priests,  suspended  priests, 
ami  apostate  priests.  They  were,  1  know,  in  my  own  county 
of  Waterford,  and  I  believe  they  were  in  every  part  of  Ire- 
land. They  are  gone,  and  the  religion  they  traded  on 
is  alive  and  flourishing.  The  Irish  language  is  living,  too, 
and  when  I  have  left  the  scene,  others  are  qualifying  them- 
selves to  take  my  place.  John  Windele,  of  Cork,  remained 
in  every  movement  for  the  cultivation  of  the  Irish  lan- 
guage until  treachery  put  an  end  to  the  Ossianic  Society. 
When  the  Keating  Society  was  set  on  foot,  he  wrote  to 
us  :  "  Have  nothing  to  do  with  Dublin — that  place  of 
shams,  and  schemes,  and  swindles."  These  shams  and 
schemes  and  swindles  nearly  killed  the  old  tongue,  but  in 
spite  of  them  it  is  still  beloved  and  cultivated.  Here  are 
Stanton's  stanzas.  He  prefaces  them  with — Stanzas  taken 
down  by  Mr.  Stanton,  Friar's  Walk,  Cork,  from  the  dic- 
tation ol  his  neighbour,  Mr.  Sexton.

excellence  of  the  ware  Johana  had  to  sell  (his  wife  I 
suppose). 

P. S. — This  paper  formed  part  of  a  somewhat  longer 
one  written  for  No.  27  of  the  Gaelic  Journal,  but  there 
was  room  for  a  small  portion  only  of  it  in  that  issue  ;  and 
that  portion  was  cut  off  from  the  end  of  the  paper.  The 
fragment  cut  off  was  piinted  at  the  top  of  the  first  column, 
p.  39,  of  the  number  above-named,  and  extends  from 
"  stanzas"  to  "pay." 


*  Formerly  it  was  the  custom  for  the  priest  or  for  the 
clerk  lo  announce  from  the  sanctuary  things  lost,  found, 
&c. ;  afierwards  such  things  were  published  at  the  chapel 
gate  by  the  parish  clerk  or  by  some  one  else  :  cuppáeC  is 
the  popular  term  for  to  publish  in  this  way. 


In  respect  of  the  word  <\cconiAin  in  the  paper,  the 
following  very  interesting  leiter  has  been  received  from 
Mr.  Lynch  of  Kilmakerin,  N.S.,  in  the  county  of  Kerry. 
It  is  an  additional  proof— if  proof  were  wanting — of  the 
temerny  of  those  who  thrust  the  word  between  the  two 
parts  of  the  title  of  the  "  Short  Catechism."  The  word, 
it  was  thought,  had  dropped  out  of  the  living  language  ; 
but  we  find  it  still  in  common  use  in  all  the  district  from 
about  Skibbereen  to  the  utmost  bounds  of  Iveragh. — Ed.

"To  the  Editor  OF  the  Gaelic  Journal. 

"Dear  Sir — Since  I  met  you  in  Dublin  last  month,  I 
have  again  read  your  remarks  in  No.  26  of  Gaelic  Journal 
on  the  substitution  of  the  word  ẃcconiAiu  for  JjeAjvp  in 
the  title  p.ige  of  the  Short  Catechism. 

In  this  barony  (Iveragh)  there  is  no  word  whose  mean- 
ing is  more  clearly  understood  than  that  of  AÙcomAip.  I 
give  below  some  sentences  to  show  the  sense  in  which  the 
word  is  used  in  this  locality,  and  you  will  see  that  it  is 
different  from  that  given  in  the  title  page  of  the  Catechism. 
The  word  AccomAip  would  never  be  used  to  express  short 
or  abridged,h\\t  always  to  express  near,  as  regards  place  or 
time. 

For  instance,  you  can  hear  people  every  day  use  such 
sentences  as  the  following  : — 

ÜÁ  Ati  •OÁ  C15  AccomAip  x>'i  céile ;  cá  An  bócap 
AccomAip  •oón  n-gAppAije;  or,  when  speaking  of  a  sick 
person  one  will  say,  cá  An  bÁp  AccomAip  tjo,  or  more 
commonly  1  ii-AcconiAipeAcc  t>o  ;  talking  of  an  approach- 
ing feast  one  will  remind  you  of  it  with,  CÁ  An  chÁipj 
(no  péiL  torvijroe  no  An  c-Samam)  accomaip  ■ouin.  On 
the  other  hand  such  expressions  as  paioip  AccomAip, 
p^eub  accomaip  or  ceurj  accomaip,  are  never  heard, 
î;eápp  or  5eanpa.1T>  being  the  adjective  invariably  used 
in  these  cases.

"FINIAN  LYNCH.

DIALOGUE       BETWEEN       DEATH 
AND  THE  SICK  MAN. 


The  following  dialogue,  or  colloquy,  be- 
tween Death  and  an  old  bed-ridden  man, 
named  ComÁp  ne  llóqxe,  was.  I  believe,  the 
first  Irish  composition  I  read  in  the  old 
characters.  I  have  seen  several  copies  of 
the  poem  since  from  which  the  name  of 
UomÁfoe  Uóij-re  had  been  omitted, and, as  is 
usual  with  many  of  our  popular  poems,  no 
two  of  these  copies  were  exactly  alike. 
Some  copies,  besides  the  poem,  as  we  intend 
giving  it,  had  a  few  stanzas  introducing  the 
subject ;  and  also  some  lines  connecting 
the  different  parts  of  the  dialogue;  but  in 
my  opinion  this  extraneous  portion  was  by 
another  and  very  inferior  poet.  The  late 
Richard  DAlton,  of  Tipperary,  published  a 
considerable  portion  of  the  poem  in  1S63, 
and  he  says  it  was  the  composition  of  the 
Right  Rev.  Dr.  O'Connell,  Bishop  of  Agha- 
doe  (the  same  prelate  who  composed  Ai|-ce 
SeAJAin  lit  ComvtLl).  Mr.  D'Alton  does 
not  say  what  authority  he  had  for  the  state- 
ment, but  we  may  be  sure  he  had  good 
authority. 

In  a  copy  of  this  poem,  seen  by  a  friend 
in  a  gentleman's  house  in  the  County  of 
Cork,  the  following  is  the  title  of  the 
poem:  "Dialogue  between  Death  and  the 
Patient,  written  originally  in  Irish  by  Denis 
O'Daly,  Abbot  of  Boyle,  in  the  14th 
century ;  translated  by  John  Collins,  of 
Myross,  in  1816,  and  written  now  in  1842, 
for  the  use  and  amusement  of  the  Rev.  M. 
Kenefick,  by  Paul  Long,  of  Carrignavar." 


Internal  evidence  would  as  soon  ascribe 
John  Gilpin  to  Geoffrey  Chaucer  as  this 
piece  to  *Oon tic «vó  111  óji  Ó  'OáIai 5  ;  but  some 
scribes  were  as  expert  in  giving  a  fictitious 
origin  and  a  fictitious  value  to  their  MSS., 
as  the  makers  of  bogus  relics  in  flint  or 
bronze  are  to-day.  Another  trick  with 
some  scribes  was  to  systematically  change 
the  spelling  of  words  so  as  to  disguise  them 
from  others ;  and  nowhere  was  this  prac- 
tice more  in  vogue  than  in  that  locality 
above  named.  What  a  different  man  was 
Richard  DAlton !  Knowing  absolutely 
nothing  of  the  Irish  language  till  well  ad- 
vanced in  years,  he  studied  it  very  closely 
for  three  years,  devoting  to  it  every  leisure 
moment  he  could  find ;  and  his  progress 
was  wonderful  for  his  opportunities.  Seeing 
the  difficulties  that  Irish  students  had  to 
contend  with  for  want  of  elementary  books, 
he  purchased  a  fount  of  type  with  which  to 
print  such  elementary  works.  Of  course  he 
could  not  know  the  expense  and  difficulty 
of  such  an  undertaking,  and,  of  course,  too, 
he  was  not  encouraged,  and  had  to  give  it 
up.  Mr.  DAlton  wanted  no  profit  from  his 
publications,  i.e.,  no  profit  for  himself.  The 
profits  were  to  be  devoted  to  the  encourage- 
ment of  youths  of  talent  to  apply  to  the 
study  of  their  country's  language.  "  Poor 
Ireland,"  said  Kickham,  somewhere,  "in  all 
your  woes  you  had  those  at  all  times  that 
loved  you  dearly!"  And  of  the  language  of 
Ireland,  too,  there  were  those  who  loved  it 
sincerely  and  unselfishly.  About  ten  years 
after  Mr.  D'Alton  had  set  up  the  printing- 
press,  I  met  him  at  Lisdoonvarna,  and  we

worth  living  a  life  of  hardship  for  the  sake 
of  knowing  Richard  D'Alton  and  Father 
Patrick  Meany  and  William  Williams.  If 
those  who  are  turning  our  native  tongue  to 
subserve  the  purposes  of  need,  or  greed,  or 
vanity,  could  know  the  pleasure  these 
patriots  found  in  working  for  that  tongue, 
without  the  inducement  of  any  ugly  selfish- 
ness ! — but  they  could  not  know  it.  Mr. 
D'Alton,  though  apparently  a  strong  man, 
died  shortly  after  I  met  him  at  Lisdoon- 
varna.  Had  he  been  spared,  he  would  have 
materially  assisted  in  the  preservation  of 
the  Irish  language  :  but  it  was  not  to  be.

NOTE. 


Line  l6.  Cia  ap  w'ob  cu?  Any  person  speaking 
Irish  can  understand  this  and  similar  expressions,  and  at 
the  same  time  nothing  in  Irish  is  more  difficult  to  unravel 
than  they.  A  man  whose  name  was  Tadhg  is  expressed 
thus  in  Irish  ( 1 )  yesy  t>'áp  b'amm  Ua-og,  or  more  fully, 
yeap  -do  a  jvo  bvó  amm  Ca-og,  a  man  to  whom  wasname 
T.ulhg  (D'áp  =  T>o,  to;  a,  whom;  p  for  po,  the  sign  of  the 
(iast  tense  ;  and  b'  =  bub,  was).  Before  proceeding  farther 
I  would  recommend  the  learner  to  make  himself  master  of 
the  last  paragraph  of  Dr.  Joyce's  Gr.,  p.  130,  idiom  34, 
and  also  of  pars.  5,  6,  8,  pp.  71,  72.    Now:  to  come  back  : 

A  man  whose  name  is  Tadhg,  is  in  Irish  (2)  yeap  -o'ap 
b'amm  üûbg  ;  and  the  full  construction  is  :  year*  •oo  a 
p-ab  amm  Ua-oj,  a  man  to  whom  is  name  Tadhg  (•oo, 
to  ;  a,  whom  ;  b  =  ab,  is). 

Note  that  after  gup,  -o'áp,  ley,  iy  (is),  becomes  ab  ; 
observe,  too,  that  the  p  in  this  last  construction  (2)  is  not 
for  po  ;  it  is  merely  euphonic,  like  any  eclipsing  letter,  and 
its  place  might  be  supplied  by  n,  as  yeap  t>'á  n-<ib  amm 
TJaTJg. 

Let  us  substitute  other  words  for  bim,  ab  ;  yeap  tiá'p 
cug  mé  aipgio-o  (-oo,  a  po  cug),  a  man  to  whom  I  gave 
money  ;  here  ihe  p  is  for  pó,  and  it  aspirates  as  in  b'  (I). 
But  in  the  phrase,  yeap  o'á  o-cugaim  aipgio-o,  a  man  to 
whom  I  give  money,  the  c  is  eclipsed  by  the  euphonic 
letter  t>,  as  ab  was  by  y  or  n. 

Again,  yeap  tj'áp  cug  mé  aipgiot),  may  be  written, 
yeap  ap  cug  mé  aipgio-o  00  (to  him)  the  tj'  (00)  govern- 
ing a,  whom,  after  it  in  the  first  clause  ;  and  in  the  second, 
the  a,  whom,  is  governed  by  the  prep,  00,  in  do,  to  him. 


11a  T>aome  Tj'ip  bam  ye  na  cLuaya  (ue,  off;  a,  whom  ; 
p  for  po),  the  people  off  whom  he  took  the  ears,  may  be 
written,  11a  -oaome  ap  bam  yé  na  cbuaya  fjiob  (wiob  — 
oe,  off;  lb,  them);  this  last  De  also  governs  a,  whom, 
before  it  as  well  as  lb  after  it. 

In  the  glossary  to  the  Todd  Lectures,  Dr.  Atkinson 
says  :  "cia,  interrog.  pron.  [never  an  adj.];  'who,  what,' 
always  forming  a  principal  clause  involving  the  verb  'to 
be,'  the  subseq.  verb  being  subordinate.''  Cia  he 
C-4caip,  cia  li-i  -oo  lhacaip,  who  [is]  he,  thy  father  ? 
who[is]she,  thy  mother?  cia  aptiiob  munvciyoo  niácap, 
who  [are]  they,  thy  mother's  people  ?" 

Cia  ap  tnob  cu=cia  h-iaT>  a  p-^b  010b  (t>e  lb)  uu  : 
Here  the  x>e  in  •oiob  governs  a,  whom,  and  1b,  ihem. 
Who  [are]  they  of  whom  thou  art  of  them  ?  A  tangled 
web.  for  any  ea-y  unravelling  of  which  I  would  feel  most 
thankful.  And  I  earnestly  invite  all  our  correspondents 
to  clear  up  all  such  expressions  they  know  in  the  next 
issue;  for  instance,  eta  Leiy  an  ceac  ym  ?  Joyce's  Gr.,

where in  Journal  to  mean  spiritual  as  applied  to

the  Midnight  Court  ;  but  that  meaning  would  mil  do

SeAJAll   5A^A- 
From  the  Irish  of  SeAgAYi  O'Laol 

C^me  list,  each  fine  fellow  who  sport  can  enjoy  ; 

I'll  give  you  a  song  on  a  "  Broth  of  a  Boy  " — 

"  Shawn  Gow!"  a  blithe   "Whaler,"  and  sound  to  the 

core — 
His  forge  by  Amhann-Mor  stands  nigh-hand  to  Lismore  ; 
Whate'er  kind  of  "  hardware  "  you  want  you'll  obtain  — 
A  gimlet,  or  chisel,  an  axe,  miv,  or  plane  ; 
A  reaping-hook,  scythe,  or  ,1  fine  slashing  spade, 
You'll  find  there  with  "pig-rings,"  the  best  ever  made. 

My  hero,  those  implements  fashions  right  well, 

With  much  more,  whose  names  I  have  scarce  time  to  tell — 

A  broad-sword  or  bayonet,  pike,  pistol,  or  gun. 

He'd  furnish  the  "  boys  "  who  kill  "  proctors  "  for  fun. 

All  tools  that  a  craftsman  can  handle  he  makes, 

From  pinceis  an  1  pliers  to  bill-hooks  and  rakes, 

Not  counting  shears,  razors,  and  well-tempered  knives 

(That  Ireland  can't  beat  'em  you  may  bet  your  lives). 

A  gate  he  can  make  in  the  fashion  most  new, 

With  lock,  bolt,  and  hinges  to  fasten  it  too  — 

A  smooth-running  axle-tree,  "lire"  fur  a  wheel. 

A  linch-pin,  a  butcher's  knife,  cleaver,  and  "steel  ;" 

All  tools  used  by  coopers  he  forges  with  skill  ; 

A  shoemaker's  awl,  ora  quarry-man's  "drill  ;" 

A  crowbar  or  "  needle."  sharp-pointed  and  slrong, 

A  pick-axe  or  "Jew's-harp  "  he'll  hammer  "ding-dong." 

He'll  make  you  of  iron  all  parts  of  a  plough 

(From  coulter  to  handles,  all's  one  to  Shawn  Gow!) 

Both  "  side-plate  "  and  "  sole-plate  "  he'll  shape  to  your 

mind, 
No  skilled  man  a  fault  with  their  working  can  find'; 
A  trace-chain  or  "  swivel,"  a  neat  swindle-tree  ; 
A  shovel  or  pitch-fork  with  "  tines  "  two  or  three'; 
An  anchor,  or  "  try  "-spawning  salmon  to  spear 
("  Bad  luck  to  the  peelers!"  'twas  //tat  brought  me  here).* 

The  choicest  of  horse-shoes,  the  shapeliest  nails. 
Are  wrought  on  his  anvil,  with  handles  for  pails; 
And  bridle  bits,  curb-chains,  and  "  loops  "  for  a  cart, 
And  sharp-rowelled    purs  to  make  lazy  nags  smart  ; 
Fine  pot-racks-and-hangers,  and  pokers  and  tongs, 
And  "skimmers"    and    flesh-forks   with  bright-shining 

prongs, 
And  gridirons,  griddles,  and  spits  for  roast  meats, 
And  beautiful  fender-,  and  line  parlour-grates. 

There  scissors  and  thimbles,   and  needles  you'll  find, 
With  fly-hooks  and  gaffs,  if  to  fish  you're  inclined, 
Ami  surgical  lane    1     t"  bleed   men  01  brutes, 
And  trumpets,  key-bugles,  "  triangles  "  and  flutes  ; 

A  plasterer's  trowel,  a  h l-chopper.'s  wedge — 

Our  Smith  makei  hisown  tools — hand-hammei  and  sledge  ; 
No  \wrker,  beside  him,  can  do  the  same  thing, 
So  of  all  jolly  craftsmen,  "  Shawn  G  re"  i-  the  King  ! 
Washington,  D.  C. 

November  71I1,  1SS7. 

Cloc-An-Ci'nnne. 

It  is  scarcely  necessary  to  say  that  the  above  is  from  the 
pen  that  made  the  version  of  the  F'air  ol  Windgap  in  the 

last  number  of  the  journal. 


■The  song  was  composed  in  Waterford  Jail  wher 
had  been  sent  for  salmon-poaching— many  a  good  mat 
neighbourhood  then  and  nozv.     "  God  help  us."

NOTE. — The  music  is  given  as  arranged  for  the  bag- 
pipes, so  that  one  or  two  of  the  shinier  notes  may  he 
omitted  in  singing.  It  must  lie  remembered  that  in 
Minister  til  and  b  between  two  vowels  are  generally  left 
unpronouncecl,  and  the  two  syllables  run  into  one,  so  that 
what  would  be  two  syllables  in  Connaught,  in  several  of 
the  words  in  the  above  is  but  one.  Five  of  the  \erses  in 
the  second  song  are  with  the  exception  of  one  line  the 
same  as  given  by  O'Daly,  but  the  tune  which  I  obtained 
from  the  Rev.  Professor  Goodman,  as  well  as  the  last 
verse,  are  quite  different  Irom  those  given  in  O'Daly's 
book.

ELEMENTARY  LESSONS  IN  IRISH. 


IRISH  LESSONS  IN  ROMAN  LETTERS. 

It  is  believed  by  the  lovers  of  the  Celtic  race  and  lan- 
guage that  some  movement  should  be  instituted  for  the 
more  effectually  welding  together  of  the  Irish,  Scotch, 
Welsh,  and  Bretons. .  As  the  beginning  of  this  move- 
ment on  our  part  we  print  this  paper  in  the  Roman 
letters  that  all  our  brother  Celts  may  be  able  to  read  it. 
The  numerical  references  in  it  are  to  the  pages  and  sec- 
tions of  Dr.  Joyce's  Iridi  Grammar,  a  work  that  every 
Irish  student  should  have  in  his  hand,  and  its  contents  in 
his  head.  Thus,  79 — 3  refers  10  page  79,  and  section  3 
ol  that  work. 

In  this  lesson  there  are  two  idioms  which  may  require 
a  few  words  of  explanation,  though  they  are  very  easy  to 
those  who  speak  Irish.  I.  Many  English  verbs  are  ex- 
pressed in  Irish  by  a  noun  akin  to  the  English  verb,  and 
do  diieanadh,  to  make  or  do  ;  thus,  to  lie,  is  breug  do 
dheanadh;  to  pay,  dioluigheacht  do  dhéanadh.  2.  Other 
vcrl>~,  such  as  to  whistle,  to  call,  &c,  are  expressed  by  a

With  this  excerpt  I  commenced  a  letter  to  Mr.  David 
Comyii.  of  Dublin,  about  4th  July,  187S.  The  Commis- 
sioners of  National  Education  had  agreed  to  place  the 
Irish  language  on  their  programme  as  one  of  the  subjects 
for  proficiency  in  which  results'  fees  would  be  paid.     For 


the  six  or  seven  years  previous  I  had  been  constantly  at 
work  to  bring  about  this  result ;  and  now  I  was  amply- 
repaid  for  all  my  labour.  And  let  me  put  on  record  here 
the  fact  that  the  revival  of  the  Iii-h  language,  so  far  as 
it  has  been  revived,  is  due  to  the  National  teachers  of 
Ireland. 

For  nearly  nine  years  of  the  decade  previous  to  July, 
1S7S,  except  at  the  Teachers'  Annual  Congress,  and  in  the 
columns  of  the  Teachers'  Journal,  the  language  of  Ireland 
was  scarcely  mentioned.  In  1S74.  the  Teachers  in  Con- 
gress unanimously  adopted  a  .Memorial  to  be  presented  to 
the  Commissioners  of  National  Education,  praying  that 
results'  fees  should  be  paid  for  teaching  Irish  in  National 
lis,  as  for  Greek.  Latin,  and  French;  and  through 
the  exertions  of  the  teachers,  in  a  short  time  this  Memo- 
rial was  signed  by  five  bishops  of  the  .South  of  Ireland,  and 
by  ab  "a!  ninety  managers  of  National  schools,  mostly 
clergymen.  It  was  the  intention  of  those  wdio  had  charge 
of  the  document  to  have  it  sent  to  the  different  Teachers' 
Associations  throughout  the  country,  in  order  to  have  it 
signed  by  the  manager-  and  other  influential  parties  in  the 
various  localities  in  Ireland.  Sir  Michael  Hicks-Beach 
was  Chief  Secretary  at  the  time,  and  lie.  in  a  speech  at 
Belfast,  said  that  the  people  of  Ireland  would  rest  content 
if  they  only  got  cheap  whiskey  and  Irish  taught  in  National 
schools.  This  showed  that  the  memorial  during  his  time 
would  be  unheeded  by  the  Commissioners,  and  the 
teacheis  put  it  in  abeyance  until  a  more  favourable  junc- 
ture. When  afterwards  the  Society  for  the  Preservation 
of  the  Irish  Language  was  formed,  the  teachers  handed  over 
to  them  their  Memorial  with  its  signatures,  and  these  formed 
the  nucleus  of  the  monster  Memorial  presented  to  the 
Commissioners  of  National  Education  in  June,  1878. 

Seldom  in  Ireland  was  a  document  so  numerously  and 
so  influentially  signed  as  that  Memorial.  The  Freeman's 
Journal  of  June  '28th,  1S78,  says  : — "  It  (the  Memorial), 
bears  in  all  about  thirteen  hundred  signatures  ;  but  the 
mere  strength  of  numbers  is  not  wdiat  forms  its  value  as 
a  powerful  expression  of  public  opinion.  To  begin  with, 
we  have  the  names  of  sixteen  members  of  the  Irish 
Hierarchy-  fifteen  Catholic  prelates  and  one  Protestant — 
tie  Bishop  of  Ossory.  Amongst  the  Catholic  prelates 
will  be  found  t'ne  names  of  the  Primate,  the  Most  Rev. 
Dr.  M'Gettigan,  the  Archbishop  of  Tuam,  and  the  Arch- 
1  i  ip  of  Cashel.  All  these  exalted  overseers  know  well 
the  value  of  the  Irish  tongue, and  the  benefits  that  would 
be  likely  to  accrue  from  the  placing  of  it  on  an  established 
footing.  The  names  of  fifty  Irish  Members  of  Par- 
liament are  attached  to  the  Memorial.  There  is  a 
powerful  array  of  signature-  from  the  chief  Irish  teaching 
institution — Trinity  College,  the  Catholic  University,  the 
numerou-  provincial  colleges,  &c.  The  Irish  Catholic 
clergv  are  largely  represented,  the  vast  bulk  of  those  who 
are  managers  of  National  Schools  having  signed.  The 
name  of  almost  every  public  man  of  note  in  the  several 
.Municipal  Corporations,  Towns  Commissioners,  Poor 
Law  Union-,  &c,  are  attached  to  the  Memorial." 

Such  was  the  array  of  names  attached  to  the  Memorial 
prayer  was  adopted  by  the  Board  of  National 
Education  on  the  2nd  day  of  July,  1S7S.  But  even  this 
analysis  civ  taint  idea  of  the  importance  of 

the  Memorial — in  a  word,  the  names  of  a  very  great  pro- 
of the  best  men  in  Ireland  were  appended  to  it. 

In  two  month-  more  .1  decade  of  years  will  have  pa-sed 
away  since  the  Commissioners  of  National  Education  gave 
their  assent  to  the  prayer  of  the  Memorial.  And  a  few 
events  connected  with  this  assent  may  be  pondered  upon 
villi  advantage  — if  Irishmen  can  ponder  on  anything 
with  advantage. 

What  was  the  meaning  of  that  assent  as  understood  by 


THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


77 


the  signatories  to  the  Memorial  ?  Sir  Patrick  Keenan 
had  recommended  ill  his  published  Reports  that  Irish- 
speaking  children  should  be  taught  first  from  Irish  books, 
and  that  they  should  afterwards  be  taught  English  through 
the  medium  of  their  own  language.  The  Irish-speaking 
children  were  at  least  a  fifth  of  the  school-going  children 
of  the  country — and  they  were  being  brought  up,  he  said, 
in  a  manner  that  made  them  the  most  stupid  children  he 
had  ever  met  with.  And  the  signatories  believed  thai 
the  assent  of  the  Commissioners  meant  that  these  children 
should  be  brought  up  as  Sir  Patrick  had  recommended. 
And  when  the  signatories  discovered  their  mistake,  did 
they  take  any  steps  to  have  things  set  to  rights?  No. 
The  thirteen  hundred  of  the  leading  men  of  Ireland  lidded 
their  arms  and  looked  on  as  if  quite  unconcernedly. 
This  will  cause  people  hereafter  to  stare;  nor  will  the 
explanation  make  things  look  better. 

It  is  generally  known  that  the  success  of  the  Memorial 
was  due  almost,  if  not  altogether,  to  the  exertions  of 
Father  Nolan  and  of  Mr.  David  Comyn.  Father  Nolan 
and  Mr.  J.  J.  MacSweeney  were  up  to  June,  1878,  or 
thereabouts,  honorary  secretaries  to  the  Society  (or  the 
Preservation  of  the  Irish  Language  ;  and  Father  Nolan, 
not  being  a  very  ready  writer,  and  not  having  much 
spare  time,  and  moreover,  believing  that  the  best 
way  he  could  help  the  Society  was  by  calling  on 
the  people  at  their  places  for  subscriptions,  &c,  wil- 
lingly agreed  to  a  proposal  that  his  brother  secretary 
should  be  paid  a  salary  of  fifteen  shillings  a  week  for 
doing  the  business  of  the  Society.  Father  Nolan 
then  required  the  paid  secretary  to  write  the  letters  per- 
taining to  the  affairs  of  the  Society,  and  that  he  as 
honorary  secretary  would  sign  them  ;  this  the  paid  secre- 
tary begged  to  decline  ;  and  from  that  day  the  Irish 
language  movement  was  doomed.  A  clergyman  from 
the  country  happened  to  be  passing  through  Dublin  the  day 
the  salary  was  to  be  proposed,  and  he  called  on  Father 
Nolan  and  advised  him  to  have  the  Society  pay  for  work 
when  required,  but  on  no  account  to  fix  a  salary  ;  no  heed 
was  given  to  his  counsel,  and  he  added,  I  believe.  "  You 
have  rung  the  knell  of  the  movement."  Within  the 
last  nine  months  this  clergyman  remarked  to  me,  in  a  sad 
tone,  "  that  was  the  turning  point  in  the  fortune  of  the 
Irish  language  ;"  and  so  it  was.  Instead  of  working 
together  as  before  for  the  interest  of  the  old  tongue,  the 
aim  of  both  parties  seemed  to  be  to  circumvent  one  another. 
There  were  quarrels  and  disagreements  at  each  successive 
meeting  of  the  Council  of  the  Society.  Friends  inter- 
fered to  unite  the  parties  ;  they  begged,  and  prayed,  and 
besought  them  for  the  sake  of  the  old  tongue  to  agree 
together  ;  but  to  no  avail.  But  this  is  not  the  place  to  tell 
what  complaints  the  parties  made  of  one  another,  nor 
does  it  matter  now  which  was  in  fault  or  most  in  fault  ; 
the  effects  are  all  we  need  look  to,  and  try  to  draw  the 
moral  from  them.  The  intelligence  spread  quickly 
through  the  country  that  the  Society  for  the  Preservation 
of  the  Irish  Languag-j  were,  like  all  Irish  societies,  quarel- 
ling  amongst  themselves,  and  the  news  did  not  suffer 
diminution  in  the  telling.  The  friends  of  the  language 
saw,  or  thought  they  saw,  that  all  was  lost ;  the 
organization  dissolved  itself.  To  make  such  changes 
in  the  National  system  of  Education  as  the  sig- 
natories to  the  Memorial  required  would  be  a  work  of 
expense  and  labour.  It  would  be  opposed  by  the  Treasury ; 
all  the  Commissioners  of  National  Education,  except  Sir 
Patrick  Keenan,  would  be  sure  to  oppose  these  changes. 
Of  all  the  officials  connected  with  the  Board  of  National 
Education  in  Ireland,  very  probably  not  a  dozen  wished 
for  any  change.  To  get  these  changes  made  then  would 
require  a  pressure  such  as  the  monster  Memorial  brought 


to  bear  on  the  Board  of  National  Education  ;  but  those  who 
wouldbring  such  a  pressure  to  bear  were  no  longer  a  united 
party.  The  ill-starred  secession  shortly  after  took  place, 
file  Irish-speaking  children  are  still  taught  as  in  the  old 
times,  and,  by  all  appearances,  so  they  will  be  taught  until 
the  language  has  died  out.  The  Irish-speaking  Celts  of 
the  sea-board  are  beyond  comparison  the  most  talented 
children  ol  the  island.  Had  they  been  brought  up  rightly, 
how  many  of  them  — men  and  women — would  be  helping 
to  spread  civilization  and  religion  from  pole  to  pole?  The 
quarrels  of,  at  most,  six  persons,  frustrated  all  this  :  these 
quarrels  will  put  an  end  to  the  language  centuries  sooner 
than  otherwise  it  would  have  died.  Nor  did  they  cease 
at  the  secession.  Some  years  since  I  was  asked  by  a 
Gaelic  Society  in  Canada  to  write  for  them  a  sketch  of 
the  Irish  language  movement,  and  I  promised  to  do  so. 
Ilui  when  I  set  about  it,  I  shrank  from  putting  on  record 
an  account  of  the  several  ways  in  which  the  leaders 
here  tried  to  combat  those  whom  they  looked  upon  as 
rivals. 

In  less  than  two  years  before  the  secession,  besides  the 
getting  up  of  the  Memorial,  the  First,  Second,  and  Third 
Irish  Books  were  published,  as  well  as  an  Irish  copy-book. 
Hie  vocabulary  for  the  first  part  of  the  Pursuit  of  Diarmuid 
and  Grainne  was  in  great  part  got  ready.  What  has 
been  done  by  the  Society  for  the  Preservation  of  the  Irish 
Language  in  all  the  nine  years  that  have  since  elapsed? 
We  will  try  to  answer  this  query  in  the  next  issue. — Ed.

THE  LYCEUM,  FATHER  KEEGAN,  &c,  &c. 

Two  very  able  papers  have  seen  the  light  within  the 
last  few  weeks.  One  of  them,  entitled  "  Life  and  Work 
in  a  Mediaeval  Monastery,"  appears  in  this  month's  is-ue 
of  the  Lyceum  :  and  had  we  space  at  our  command  we 
would  with  pleasure  transfer  the  greater  portion  of  this 
article  lo  our  pages  ;  but  we  must  content  ourselves  with 
a  few  brief  extracts  from  it.  Though  the  scenes  described 
in  this  paper  are  far  away  in  time  and  place,  the  dramatis 
persona  were  Irishmen.  Speaking  of  the  stale  of  learning  in 
Europe  in  ihefilth  and  sixth  centuries,  the  paper  states  that, 
"  whatever  ^literary  activity  still  existed  about  the  old 
academies  of  Italy  and  Gaul  must  only  be  regarded  as  the 
parting  rays  of  light,  fast  sinking  into  night.  Yet,  as  they 
sink  the  beams  of  another  luminary  are  visible  far  out  on 
the    horizon,   in    the    institution  of    the   great  monastic 

schools It  needed  a  people  which  combined 

the  gifts  of  a  cultivated  spiritual  temper  with  the  vigour 
of  a  bold  and  adventurous  national  character,  to  force  the 
blessings  of  enlightenment  on  the  new  kingdoms  of  the 
West.  And  of  European  peoples  the  Irish  alone  pos- 
sessed these  necessary  gifts  for  such  a  mission.  They 
were  made  to  be  missionaries  ol  light  in  the  new  Europe. 
.  Their  plan  for  the  civilization  of  the  pagans  was 
to  set  up  in  their  midst  religii  us  institutions  like  those 
they  had  left  behind  them  in  their  own  land.  ...  A 
picture  of  one  of  these  great  monastic  establishments  of 
the  middle  ages  will  convey  better  than  any  words  of 
ours  the  nature  of  the  forces  at  work  to  give  the  arts  of 
peace  development,  and  to  form  the  ideas  and  tastes  of 
the  people  to  the  ways  of  civilization.  For  this  purpose 
a  better  example  could  not  be  chosen  than  St.  Gall's.  .  . 
This  great  institution  .  .  .  owed  its  origin  to  Gall,  an  Irish 
disciple  of  St.  Columbanus,  wdio  in  the  seventh  century 
penetrating  into  the  wild  recesses  of  the  Helvetian  moun- 
tains, there  fixed  his  abode  among  the  savage  Alemanni, 
many  of  whom,  touched  by  his  eloquence,  were  brought 
to  the  faith  of   Christ.     .     .    .    St.  Gall's  was   to   the

learned  of  the  ninth   century   almost  as  much  a  place  of 
resort,  as  Athens  or  Alexandria  had  been  in  their  day. 

"  Very  striking  in  aspect  was  this  world-famed  Irish 
abbey,  in  whose  halls  lectures  were  given  in  the  Eastern 
tongues,  whilst  its  monks,  the  finest  classic  scholars  of 
the  clay,  found  time  to  go  out  upon  the  mountains  preach- 
ing plain  truths  in  barbarous  idioms  to  a  rude  and  savage 
race 

"In  the  Benedictine  monasteries  two  kinds  of  schools 
existed  :  the  greater  and  the  less.  .  .  Children  began 
their  education  at  a  very  early  age,  sometimes  at  five  or 
six,  when  they  were  expected  to  learn  by  heart  certain 
portions  of  Holy  Scripture,  first  and  foremost  being  the 
Psalter.      .      . 

"A  chill  as  soon  as  he  had  learned  to  read  and  write, 
set  to  work  on  the  Latin  Grammar  of  Donatus.  From 
Ins  ninth  to  his  twelfth  year  he  studied  elementary  Latin 
books.  ...  As  time  went  on  select  portions  of 
Seneca,  Ovid,  Virgil,  Persius  and  Horace,  Lucan  and 
Stalius  were  explained  and  committed  to  memory,  fol- 
lowed later  on  by  Cicero,  Quinctilian,  and  the  Latin 
version  of  Aristotle. 

"  Over  the  door  of  the  scriptorium  there  was  "an  in- 
scription to  the  effect  that  copyists  should  refrain  from 
idle  words,  be  diligent  in  writing,  and  take  care  the  text 
be  not  corrupted  by  careless  mistakes.  Twelve  monks 
sat  here  employed  in  the  labour  ol  transcription,  by  means 
of  whose  ceaseless  work  the  huge  library  was  gradually 
formed.  It  was  no  scene  of  artistic  dilettantism,  but  of 
real  honest  hard  work.  When  their  educaiion  had  been 
finished,  the  main  employment  of  the  St.  Gall  monks  in 
the  ninth  and  tenth  centuries  consisted  in  transcription, 
and  they  were  always  furnished  with  plenty  to  do.  . 
The  beauty  of  their  MSS.  is  praised  by  all  antiquarians." 

Such  svas  the  way  in  Which  our  countrymen,  mure  than 
a  thousand  years  ago,  advanced  civilization  and  religion 
among  rude  and  savage  races  in  Germany,  Gaul,  Switzer- 
land, and  Scotland.  And  it  may  be  well  to  inform  our 
young  readers  what  influence  their  works  have  had  on  the 
fate  of  the  Irish  language.  As  Irish  youths  go  now  to 
our  colleges  and  universities,  so  did  they  in  the  old  times 
flock  to  the  monasteries  founded  by  their  kinsmen  on  the 
Continent.  The  teachers  in  these  institutions  wrote  down, 
between  the  lines  and  on  the  margins  of  the  class-book 
MS.,  the  Irish  synonymes  of  the  Lalin  words  in  the  texts. 
These  Irish  words,  the  oldest  written  Iridi  words  now 
extant,  formed  vocabularies  for  the  Irish  students,  and 
after  the  lapse  of  a  thousand  years  they  have  drawn  the 
greatest  scholars  of  the  Continent  to  study  the  Celtic  lan- 
guages. The  names  of  Zeuss  and  Ebel  and  Windisch  and 
Zimmer,  are  now  as  well  known  in  Ireland  as  on  the 
Continent.  The  first-named  of  these  scholars  S3w  the 
value  of  the  Irish  glosses  in  these  old  MSS.,  devoted  his 
lite  to  the  study  of  them,  wrote  the  most  learned  work  on 
Irish  grammar  ever  composed,  and  placed  the  Irish 
language  in  its  proper  place,  beside  Latin  and  Greek, 
and  Sanscrit,  &c,  as  one  of  the  Indo-European  languages. 
Before  his  time,  Irish  was  believed  to  be  related  to 
Hebrew,  and  its  kindred  languages,  and  pseudo-philolo- 
gists by  their  foolish  derivations  and  roots  of  Irish  words, 
set  all  the  scholars  of  the  world  laughing  at  the  language 
of  Ireland.  Now,  thanks  to  the  scholars  of  the  Con- 
tinent, the  most  learned  men  of  Europe  and  America  think 
the  Irish  language  and  literature  well  worth  studying,  and 
this  changed  state  of  affairs  we  owe  to  the  old  MSS.  of  St. 
Gall  and  of  the  other  monastic  institutions  of  the  Continent. 
The  Lyceum,  from  which  the  extracts  above  have  been 
taken,  is  a  monthly  periodical  published  by  Keating, 
Dublin,  and  any  of  our  readers  who  have  a  taste  for  sound 
high-class  literature  could  not  do  better  than  peruse  it. 


We  forbear  mentioning  its  price,  lest  the  cheapness  of  the 
book  might  give  people  a  false  idea  of  the  value  of  its 
contents. 

FATHER  KEEGAN 

has  written  a  letter  to  Donohoe's  [American]  Magazine, 
which  we  certainly  should  transfer  to  our  pages  whole  and 
entire,  were  it  not  that  it  tells  too  many  truths  which 
persons  amongst  us  would  not  wish  told.  Like  the 
writer  of  the  last  paper.  Father  Keegan  brings  his  readers 
to  Germany.  In  a  few  words,  he  tells  what  the  Irish 
missionaries  had  done  to  raise  the  Teutons,  and  then 
refers  to  the  way  in  which  German  scholars,  after  the 
lapse  of  so  many  ages,  are  repaying  us  by  the  editing  and 
publication  of  our  Irish  MS. — materials  which  we  ourselves 
had  left  rotting  for  all  those  ages.  He  contrasts  the  two 
races — the  Irish  and  theGerman.  These  latter,  by  making 
good  use  of  their  advantages,  have  raised  themselves  to  the 
first  place  among  nations,  especially  as  soldiers  and 
scholars.  The  Irish  are  naturally  a  higher  race  than  the 
Teutons ;  human  hands,  he  says,  never  fashioned  more 
beautiful  ornaments  in  gold  and  silver  than  those  in  the 
Royal  Irish  Academy  ;  by  no  fingers,  except  those  of  an 
Irishman,  were  penmanship  and  illumination  brought  to 
such  perfection  as  were  those  seen  in  our  older  Irish  MSS.; 
and  he  quotes  Dr.  Atkinson  as  saying  that  the  sweetest 
poetry  ever  composed  is  to  be  found  in  those  same  old 
Irish  manuscripts.  And  yet,  in  spite  of  all  these  gifts  of 
nature,  the  Irish  now  hold  the  lowest  position  among 
civilized  peoples.     Father  Keegan  goes  on  to  sav  : 

"The  history  of  Ireland  is  one  weary  record  of  the  loss 
of  every  thing  but  religion — and  there  are  signs  that  that 
is  going  to  follow  the  rest — lossof  land,  of  language,  of  liter- 
ature,of  art,  and  latterly,  of  historical  self-respect.  .  .  , 
Emigrants  to  this  [America]  and  other  countries  are  so 
poorly  prepared  for  commencing  life  in  strange  lands,  and 
under  new  conditions,  that  very  many  of  them  end  in 
failure  .  .  This  is  due  to  pure  negligence,  and  in- 
excusable sloth  on  the  part  of  those  wdio  should  train  and 
teach  the  people.  After  the  relaxation  of  the  penal  laws 
they  as  a  body  spoke  the  Irish  language,  and  needed 
nothing  only  to  have  Irish  books  printed,  and  Irish 
schools  opened.  To  take  in  hand  the  education  of  the 
people  in  the  manner  described  would  require  great 
labour,  perseverance,  and  the  sacrifice  of  much  creature 
comfort  on  the  part  of  the  leaders,"  &c. 

Well,  we  are  patriots  and  practical  people  forsooth.  It 
took  us  all  the  time  up  to  1S55  to  find  out  that  children 
could  best  learn  in  their  own  language  ;  and  when  Sir 
Patrick  Keenan  made  the  discovery,  and  proclaimed  it 
for  two  or  three  years  successively  -  proclaimed  it  at  the 
serious  risk  of  injuring  his  own  prospects — not  a  voice 
wras  raised  in  all  Ireland  to  second  him.  A  dozen  years 
later,  in  his  evidence  before  the  Royal  Commission,  he 
repeated  what  he  had  said  in  his  reporis,  and  again  the 
Irish  patriots  were  mute.  The  Irish  National  teachers 
from  about  this  time  agitated  for  the  Preservation  of  the 
Irish  Language,  as  is  stated  in  another  page  ;  the  Society 
in  Dublin  followed  on  and  roused  the  nation  to  make  one 
supreme  effort  to  have  the  Irish-speaking  children  taught 
Irish,  at  first  in  National  schools,  and  then  the  greed  and 
vanity  and  crotchets  of  less  than  half-a-dozen  individuals 
were  able  to  break  up  the  organization,  and  to  destroy 
the  last  chance,  perhaps,  of  having  these  poor  children 
taught  rationally  ! 

The  example  of  our  Welsh  kinsmen  should  be  in- 
ducement enough  to  rouse  us  to  manly  action  for  the 
preservation  of  our  noble  tongue — if  there  were  any 
manliness  left  in  us.  In  his  paper  of  May  13,  1877,  the 
editor  of  the  Literary  World  wrote  : — "It  appears  that  at 


THE    GAELIC  JOURNAL.

the  Revolutionary  period  the  great  body  of  the  Welsh 
people  had  acquired  a  competent  knowledge  of  English, 
and  that  their  own  language  had  died  out  of  mind  and 
memory."  About  1730  the  Rev.  Griffith  Jones  wrote: — 
"Should  all  our  Welsh  books  and  our  excellent  version 
of  the  Bible,  Welsh  preaching,  and  the  stated  worship  of 
God  in  our  language,  be  taken  away  to  bring  us  to  a 
disuse  of  our  tongue?  So  they  arc,  in  a  manner,  in  some 
places — the  more  our  misery,  and  yet  the  people  are  no 
more  better  scholars  than  they  are  better  Christians  for 
it." 

About  thirty  years  after  the  death  of  the  Rev.  Griffith 
Jones,  the  Rev.  Thomas  Charles,  of  Bala,  in  a  letter 
stated  that,  on  taking  charge  of  his  Welsh  mission,  he 
"soon  found  the  poor  people  to  be  in  the  same  state  of 
ignorance  throughout  the  whole  country.  The  generality 
[of  the  children]  were  left  totally  ignorant  oi  any  instruc- 
tion." This  gentleman  devoted  himself  to  the  task  of 
inducing  his  countrymen  to  learn  to  read  their  own 
language  first.  He  trained  teachers  himself;  he  wrote 
catechisms  and  other  elementary  works  of  instruction  in 
Welsh.  He  got  up  Sunday  schools ;  and  he  showed  the 
parents  that  their  children  could  and  did  learn  to  read  the 
Welsh  Bible  with  intelligence  in  six  months,  whereas  it 
took  two  years  to  learn  to  read  easy  portions  of  it 
mechanically  in  English.  This  latter  proof  was  too  con- 
vincing. The  Welsh  fathers  and  mothers  believed,  as 
firmly  as  our  own  fathers  and  mothers  do,  that  learning 
the  language  ol  the  country  unfitted  their  children  for 
lisping  with  sufficient  gentility  the  fashionable  language 
of  the  State.  But  they  could  not  withstand  the  evidence 
of  their  own  eyes  and  ears.  Common  sense  prevailed. 
The  children  of  the  Principality  learn  to  read  their  own 
language  in  the  Sunday  schools,  without  any  help  from 
the  State,  be  it  remembered.  "  They  learn  as  much 
Welsh  in  an  hour  or  two  on  Sunday,  as  they  would  in  an 
English  school  in  several  hours  each  day  of  the  six 
days  of  the  week."  The  Welsh  are  now  an  intelligent 
and  thriving  people  ;  and  so  would  the  people  of  Donegal, 
and  Connemara,  and  West  Munster  be  if  brought  up  as 
the  Welsh  people  are. 
And  now  where  are  we  ? 

Through  the  fault  of  some  few  persons,  all  idea  ofgetting 
our  Irish-speaking  children  properly  taught  must  be 
abandoned  ;  what  then  is  to  be  done  for  the  old  tongue  ? 
We  have  tons  of  MS.  materials  which  foreign  scholars  are 
diligently  working  at ;  but  they  can  never  do  them  correctly, 
no  matter  how  well  they  know  the  grammar  of  the  old 
tongue — not,  at  any  rate,  until  they  have  spent  years  in 
learning  the  modern  Irish.  After  years  so  passed  they 
may  not  be  able  to  discourse  in  the  modern  language,  but 
they  will  have  a  colloquial  knowledge  of  it  that  will 
enable  them  to  understand  the  Irish  idioms.  But  it  is 
only  by  our  own  people  that  even  a  small  portion  of  these 
MS.  materials  can  be  edited. 

What  then  remains  to  be  done  is  to  encourage  the 
teachers  and  pupils  in  the  Irish-speaking  districts  to  re- 
doubled exertion.  The  progress  being  made  in  the  lan- 
guage both  in  Ireland  and  America  is  simply  astonishing. 
Leiters  which  I  receive  from  different  quarters,  and  from 
young  scholars,  are  such  as  not  a  dozen  persons  in  the 
world  would  write  ten  years  ago  ;  and  I  am  proud  and 
happy  to  say  that  many  of  these  writers  do  thank  the 
Gaelic  Journal  for  their  knowledge  of  the  language.  Let 
me  then  appeal  to  the  lovers  of  the  language  to  help  us  to 
keep  the  Journal  alive.  I  beg  for  assistance  from  them — 
material  and  literary  assistance.  I  am  a  veiy  indifferent 
beggar  ;  but  I  think  I  should  have  begged  sooner  for  the 
Gaelic  Journal.  Further,  to  tax  the  too  generous  friends 
who  have  hitherto  kept  us  afloat  would  be  a  shame. 


ADVERSE  FORCES. 
Si  range  as  it  may  appear,  the  greatest  obstacle  in  the 
way  of  those  who  are  studying  the  Irish  language  is  the 
incorrect  manner  in  which  popular  works  in  any  way  con- 
nected with  the  language  have  been  printed  during  the 
last  forty  years  ;  and  as  yet  there  is  no  improvement  in 
this  respect,  but  the  contrary.  For  instance,  in  the  last 
issue  of  the  Journal  of  the  Royal  Historical  and  Archreo- 
logical  Association  of  Ireland,  there  is  a  paper  containing 
some  names  of  persons  anil  places  ;  and  in  explaining  the 
meanings  of  these  names  the  contributor  has  managed  to 
make  two  or  three  mistakes  on  an  average  in  each  name. 
The  paper  has  been  supplied  by  Mr.  Gabriel  O'C.  Red- 
mond, wdio  does  not  claim  to  be  the  author  of  it.  It  is  a  tra- 
ditional narrative  of  the  murder  of  some  officers  at  Sleady 
Castle,  a  locality  in  the  County  of  Watei  ford,  nearly  250 
years  ago.  Mr.  Redmond,  I  believe,  is  a  native  of  this 
county,  and  presumably  an  Irish  scholar.  His  explana- 
tions of  the  names  would,  therefore,  be  looked  up  to  as 
correct,  though  he  neither  reads  nor  speaks  Irish,  nor  is 
his  ear  trained  to  catch  the  pronunciation  of  Irish  words 
correctly  when  he  hears  them  spoken. 

The  owner  of  Sleady  Castle  was  pilib  in  c-p'o-oa, 
Silken  Philip.  Mr.  Redmond  writes  this  /V/ilib  na  2'iioda  : 
p,  not  ph,  is  the  initial  of  pilib  ;  the  mas.  art.  an,  not  the 
fern.  art.  11a  agrees  with  fiooa,  silk,  a  mas.  noun  ;  the  c 
in  u-po-oa  is  an  eclipsing  letter,  not  a  part  of  the  name. 
Philip's  daughter  is  niaine  rinTir-  tli  pilib  ah  c-po-oa, 
sweet  Mary,  daughter  of  Silken  Philip,  which  Mr.  Red- 
mond writes  Mai  re  w/ilis  ni  P/iihb  na  7iioda  ;  m,  in  milis, 
should  be  aspirated  ;  Ni,  an  abbreviation  fornigean,  does 
not  aspirate  a  Christian  name.  'Si  iiláirie  tli  pilib  ó'ii 
jj-cnpiuu"  i'o  caoblmn. 

Caprtai;;  an  coroalca  (pron.  collaca),  is  literally  the 
rock  of  the  sleep.  Mr.  Redmond  writes  it  Carrig  na 
CAodia.,  pronounced  by  him  Carrig  na  Hullah.  The  na, 
here,  is  not  the  article,  but  a  contraction  for  111a,  in  its  ; 
Carrig  na  Chodla  is  the  rock  in  its  sleep,  or  rather  in  her 
sleep— Carrig  in  Irish  being  fem.  The  initial  of  Codla, 
theiefoie,  should  not  be  aspirated  ;  no  Irish  speaker  would 
ever  mistake  any  of  these  distinctions.  And  any  old 
man  or  woman  would  translate  Carrig  na  Hullah,  the  rock 
of  the  oil,  or  of  the  unction. 

<.\c  Aii-c-raig-onitNA,  the  soldier's  ford,  is  written  by  Mr. 
Redmond  Ath-«a-Soighidura  ;  and  sniis-iiangabap,  the 
village  of  the  goats,  he  writes  Graigue-na-Gower,  which 
he  translates,  the  Brambly  Hill-side. 

The  scene  of  the  outrage  is  Curiae  na  flacroa  or  na 
r-lao-oaiü  ;  this  Mr.  Redmond  makes  Curach  na  Sleady, 
the  "  Bog  of  the  Quagmires."  There  may  be  bogs  and 
quagmires  in  the  locality,  but  they  had  nothing  to  do  with 
the  name.  The  name  was  given  from  some  murder  com- 
mitted there  (ylaox)  or  plao-oa,  a  murder) ;  but  this  event 
took  place  long  before  1641,  for  the  townland  was  called 
Sleady  years  before.  The  fact  is,  the  details  of  the  murder 
were  forgotten,  but  the  name  furnished  a  hint  to  some  one 
to  invent  another  tale  to  account  for  the  name.  This  is  a 
very  common  process  in  most  localities  in  Ireland  ;  the 
following  instance  is  a  good  one  of  thK  kind. 

Crtoc,  cpnp  cpop  are  all  synonyms  for  a  cross  (See 
the  Names  of  Places  by  Dr.  Joyce,  vol.  i.).  This  work, 
too,  informs  us  that  in  old  times  crosses  were  erected  in 
several  places  which  took  their  names  from  this  circum- 
stance. Such  a  place  is  Cnoc  na  C)\oice,  in  legal  docu- 
ments, Knocknacrohy  ;  but  colloquially,  Gallowshill,  a 
townland  in  the  parish  of  Rathgomiuck,  and  County  of 
Waterford,  where  I  taught  a  National  school  for  thirty 
years.  That  the  name  Cnoc  na  Cpotce,  the  hill  of  the 
cross,  was  called  from  a  cross  erected  there,  admits  of  no

doubt.  This  townland  of  Kno;knacrohy  was  a  subdivi- 
sion of  the  townland  of  Rathgormuck,  whore  there  are  the 
rain,  of  an  old  monastery,  a  dependency  of  the  celebrated 
monastic  institution  of  Mothil;  ami  where  a  patron  has 
been  heM  from  time  immem  >  al  on  the  I4tli  September, 
the  Exaltation  of  the  Holy  Cross.  This  shows  that  the 
parish  was  dedicated  tinier  the  invocation  of  the  Holy 
Cross.  The  Exaltation  of  the  Holy  Cross  is  called  in 
Irish  LÁ  na  Choice  llaoirh,  pronounced  in  thai  lo  .  i  ■.  1  i 
na  Cp  "'n  \oi.  a  term  the  people  there  do  not  understand. 
A  preacher  there  some  years  since  said  lie  thoughl  Cnocnaoi 
was  the  nam-  of  a  saint  ;  an  1  from  the  fem.  article  ha  Ire- 
fore  the  term,  he  inferred  it  was  the  name  of  a  woman. 
But  how  was  the  place  called  Gallowshill?  Cnoc  is  not 
now  understood  in  Walerford  with  the  meaning  of  a  cross  ; 
it  means  gallows,  a  place  of  execution.  But  with  this 
new  meaning  of  the  name,  Gallowshill,  a  tale  had  to  be 
invented  to  account  for  the  new  name.      Here  it  is. 

The  castle  of  Kalligorniuck,  now  a  ruin,  was  the  resi- 
dence of  a  branch  of  the  noble  family  of  Power,  or  I)e  la 
Poer,  and  these' had  a  gallows  on  the  eminence  a  short 
distance  above  their  residence,  on  which  they  suspended 
those  obnoxious  to  them.  One  of  those  so  suspended  was 
the  -on  of  a  poor  widow,  who  brought  him  to  the  master  to 
complain  that  he  was  wild,  &c,  ;  the  master  promised  to 
make  him  quiet,  and  for  this  purpose  hanged  him.  The 
widow  gave  her  curse  to  the  murderer,  and  by  the  same 
token  there  has  been  a  bnaon  pniifin,  falling  in  some  re- 
cess of  the  old  castle  to  this  day. 

And  when  the  gallows  was  not  in  working  order,  it 
would  appear  there  was  a  shorter  way  of  getting  rid  of 
culprits  in  cnoc  rw\  cnoice.  The  name  of  a  big  stone  on  the 
townland,  used  as  a  block  on  which  to  cut  off  heals,  was 
cloc  ha  j-ceonni.  This  si. me.  some  person  fancied,  had 
blood-stains  upon  it,  and  hence  the  appellation  and  the 
tale  as  to  it,  use.  ft  had  lain  since  some  geological  epoch 
on  the  ground  where  two  estates  touched  until  a  few  years 
since,  when  the  owners  of  these  estates — the  Marquis  of 
Waterford  and  Count  de  la  Poer — each  wished  to  have 
it  removed  to  his  own  residence.  It  is  now,  I  believe,  at 
the  mansion  of  Count  de  la  Poer,  at  Gurteen. 

The  journal  of  the  R.H.&  A.  Association  hasdone  a  great 
deal  for  the  preservation  of  Irish  antiquities,  and  I  think 
it  is  now  as  ably  conducted  as  ever,  with  the  one  single 
exception,  as  regards  Irish  names.  Could  not  some 
person  Be  got  to  look  at  these  names  before  inserting 
them  in  this  crude  form  in  a  respectable  periodical.  Mr. 
Redmond,  I  believe,  is  a  young  man.  As  he  has  a  taste 
for  the  study  of  our  antiquities,  would  it  not  be  worth  his 
while  to  learn  our  language  ?  It  cannot  be  difficult  for  him 
in  any  part  of  the  County  Waterford  to  find  pers  ins  capable 
of  pronouncing  Irish  words  and  names  correctly.  In 
a  former  issue  of  the  journal  of  the  R.H.A.A.  there 
appeared  another  article  over  Mr.  Redmond's  name,  in 
which  there  were  serious  mistakes  respecting  Cappoquin 
and  some  other  place-names.  These  I  pointed  out  to  a 
respectable  member  of  the  Association,  who,  I  under- 
stand, conveyed  to  Mr.  Redmond  what  I  had  said  ;  but 
it  would  appear  that  no  heed  was  given  to  the  corrections, 
and  no  course  was  left  but  to  make  the  corrections  in  the 
G.  foiii  nal. 

The  only  question  now  is  whether  it  is  right  lo  point 
out  mistakes  of  this  kind  in  our  Journal.  Was  it  right 
or  was  ii  not  to  correct  the  blunder  of  Mr.  Abercromby, 
for  instance,  of  which  correction  the  late  editor  of  the 
'tique  in  a  note  to  me  said  : — "  Your  correction 
is  obvious."  The  corrections  in  the  journal  of  Hugo 
Meyer,  Professor  Zimmer  and  Whitley  Stokes  are  equally 
obvious  ;  should  they  have  been  made,  or  would  it  be  the 
better  course  to  let  the  mistakes  remain  for  the  edification 


of  future  antiquaries?  If  it  be  decided  that  to  make  the  cor- 
rections were  the  better  course,  there  was  a  greaternecessity 
to  correct  the  numerous  errors  in  the  publications  of  the 
"  Society  for  the  Preservation  of  the  Irish  Language  ;  " 
these  latter  publications  being  the  text-books  of  our  young 
students,  who  would  be  led  astray  by  the  multi  udinous 
errors  in  these  text-books.  A  volume  has  been  added 
latelyto  the~e  books,  and  I  find  that  errors  I  had  pointed 
out  in  a  former  volume  of  them  have  been  corrected  in 
the  late  one,  so  far  as  they  could  have  been  corrected. 
Of  tins  late  volume  I  expect  to  give  a  notice  in  the  next 
issue  of  the  journal ;  meantime  I  think  our  young  learners 
have  a  right  to  be  grateful  to  the  journal  for  these  cor- 
rection-. And  should  not  the  editor  whom  the  G. 
Journal  had  enabled  to  correct  his  mistakes  feel  grateful, 
loo  ?  But  this  is  a  small  matter.  Not  so  the  fact  that 
the  Irish  language  is  being  systematically  corrupted  under 
the  name  and  with  the  ,money  of  the  Society  for  the 
Preservation  of  the  Irish  Language.  Somebody  re- 
marked of  Matthew  Arnold's  method  of  commending  the 
Bible,  that  it  was  like  "seeking  to  promote  a  man's  vigour 
and  capacity  for  usefulness  by  cutting  out  his  heart." 
Just  as  rational  is  the  method  ol 'cultivating  the  Irish  lan- 
guage, by  corrupting  it  at  the  heart's  core.  And  to  have 
this  done  under  the  shelter  of  the  Society's  name,  is  as 
sad  an  event  as  we  can  well  have  even  in  Ireland.  It  is 
doubly  sad  when  the  result  is  thought  of.  Our  young 
boys  and  girls,  preparing  for  examination  in  Irish,  are 
drinking  from  an  impure  source.  Hereafter  when  they 
lake  the  works  of  Keating  or  Donlevy,  or  Father 
O'Sullivan,  in  hands,  and  find  them  opposed  to  the  class- 
books  they  had  learned  with  so  much  labour,  they  must 
unlearn  what  they  had  learned  ;  or  more  probably,  they 
will  give  up  the  study  of  Irish  in  disgust.  In  the  Society 
for  the  Preservation  of  the  Irish  Language  the  great 
majority  are  lovers  of  the  old  tongue  ;  and  many  love  it 
as  unselfishly  as  any  persons  living  ;  and  to  think  that  all 
the-e  in  nine  years  have  done  nothing  but  corrupt  the 
language,  except  to  tell  that  some  others  are  studying  it. 
In  our  next  issue  we  expect  to  turn  the  suggestions  of 
Captain  de  la  Hoyde,  Mr.  Fleming,  of  Cork,  and  other 
i  ^respondents,  to  practical  account.  We  will  also  try  lo 
find  room  for  a  very  interesting  Irish  letter  from  Captain 
Norris,  which  has  been  crushed  out  this  time.  In  case  of 
delay  in  receiving  the  Journal,  receipts  for  subscriptions, 
&c,  I  earnestly  request  to  have  this  notified  to  me,  and  I 
shall  see  things  rectified.  Though  scant  my  leisure  time, 
it  is  more  than  my  fellow-workers  have. — Ed.  G.f.

ADDRESS  OF  THE  GAELIC  UNION 
TO  THE  IRISH  PEOPLE. 

One  of  our  sweetest  living  singers,  p<.vo- 
HA15,  has  asked  our  brethren  in  the  greater 
Ireland  : — <\n  b--puit/tni"o  5A11  meA]~  aji  Á)i 
■o-ceẃngAin  ?  ẃii  b-v/uilmÌT)  jjaii  nieA|'  op-

added  : — ■bmeAnn  me>.\p  A|i  tn\  x>Aonib  'j;a 
b-pnL  meAf  o|itu\  pern;  A  clergyman  of 
the  Southern  province,  twenty  years  and 
more  after  his  ordination, a  couple  of  years 
since,  read  Mass,  for  the  first  time,  on  the 
altar  where  he  knelt  when  a  boy.  He  read 
in  Irish  the  contents  of  the  paper  on  which 
were  written  the  announcements  to  be 
made  to  the  congregation,  and  then  added, 
"aiji  ecYtjtA  50  b-y/uil  Aorme  Atinr'o  com 
jolÁnco,  Ajup  riAji  ring  yé  mé,  leijy/n3  me

will  not  be  necessary  to  translate  for  those 
whom  we  address  the  scathing  words  of 
jDAtirtAij;  ;  the  following  extract  from  the 
speech  of  Mr.  Gladstone  at  the  late  Welsh 
Eisteddfod  will  effectually  do  this.  To 
praise  an  individual  or  a  nation  for  qualities 
in  which  others  are  notoriously  wanting,  is 
the  most  bitter  satire  upon  those  others. 
Mr.  Gladstone  had  the  highest  praise  for  a 
people  not  more  numerous  than  those  of  a 
province  in  Ireland,  because  they  had  pre- 
served the  music,  the  language,  and  the 
customs  of  their  country  and  of  their 
fathers.  And  we,  fellow-countrymen — our 
fathers  had  a  language,  and  music,  and 
customs — and  where  are  they?  The  Welsh 
are  respected,  and  have  a  respect  lor  them- 


selves ;  and  we  ?     This  is  Mr.  Gladstone's 
address  : — 

"  A  country  is  in  a  good  and  sound  and 
healthy  state  when  it  exhibits  the  spirit  of 
progress  in  all  its  institutions,  and  in  all  its 
operations  ;  and  when,  with  the  spirit  of 
progress,  it  combines  the  spirit  of  affec- 
tionate retrospect  upon  the  time  and  the 
generations  that  have  gone  before,  and  the 
determination  to  husband  and  to  turn  to 
the  best  account  all  that  these  previous 
generations  have  accumulated  of  what  is 
good  and  worthy  for  the  benefit  of  us  their 
children — (cheers) — that  I  take  to  be  the 
object  and  the  purpose  of  this  Eisteddfod, 
which  is  a  memorial  of  the  past.  There 
are  some  who  say  that  its  purpose  is  a 
mistake,  and  although  I  do  not  know 
whether  there  are  any  to  be  found  in 
Wales  who  say  so  now,  there  used  to  be 
people  who  said  that  its  purpose  is  a  mis- 
take ;  and  I  recollect  the  time  when  it  was 
the  custom  for  many  men,  while  recognising 
the  noble  feeling  which  actuated  those  who 
got  up  the  Eisteddfod,  to  deplore  it  as  an 
economical  error.  They  deplored  the  reten- 
tion of  the  Welsh  language,  and  said,  'Why 
cannot  you  have  one  language,  one  speech, 
and  one  communication?'  Well,  I  don't 
intend  to  enter  at  full  length  into  that 
question,  but  I  must  own  that  I  have  not 
heard  or  found  that  Welshmen  when  they 
go  into  England  ever  lose  their  attach- 
ment to  their  native  land — (cheers) — and  I 
have  not  found  that  they  are  placed  at  any 
undue  disadvantage  in  consequence  of  that 
attachment,  although  that  attachment  em- 
braces and   regards  as  the  centre  of  Welsh

life  the  tongue  that  is  spoken  by  the 
people  (cheers).  But,  gentlemen,  I  wish  to 
say  what,  perhaps,  will  shock  some  men — 
what  shall  I  call  them  ? — some  who  would 
call  themselves,  at  any  rate,  '  nineteenth 
century'  men.  I  wish  to  say  that,  in  my 
opinion,  the  principle  of  nationality,  the 
principle  of  reverence  for  antiquity,  the 
principle  of  what  I  may  call  local  patriot- 
ism, is  not  only  an  ennobling  thing  in  itself, 
but  has  a  great  economical  value  (hear, 
hear).  That  may  seem  a  bold  statement, 
but  everybody  feels,  I  think,  the  first  por- 
tion of  it  to  be  true,  namely,  that  it  is  of 
an  ennobling  character.  The  attachment 
to  your  country,  the  attachment  to  your 
local  country,  the  attachment  among 
British  subjects  to  Britain,  but  also  the 
attachment  amongst  Welsh  born  people  to 
Wales,  has  in  it,  in  some  degree,  the  nature 
both  of  an  appeal  to  energy  and  an  incite- 
ment to  its  development,  and,  likewise,  no 
few  elements  of  a  moral  standard;  for  the 
Welshman,  go  where  he  may,  will  be  un- 
willing to  disgrace  that  name  (hear,  hear, 
and  cheers).  It  is  matter  of  familiar  obser- 
vation that  even  in  the  extreme  East  of 
Europe,  wherever  free  institutions  have 
supplanted  a  state  of  despotic  Government, 
the  invariable  effect  has  been  to  ad- 
minister an  enormous  stimulus  to  the  in- 
dustrial activity  of  the  country.  That  is 
the  case  wherever  we  go,  and,  in  my 
opinion,  as  I  think,  with  the  sense  of  your 
Welsh  birth,  and  what  you  yourselves  call 
your  Welsh  nationality,  if  it  tends  to  the 
general  healthy  development  of  the  man, 
and  if  it  makes  him  more  of  a  man  than 
he  would  be  without  it,  in  my  opinion  it 
would  make  him  not  only  morally  but 
economically  a  man  of  greater  value  than 
he  otherwise  could  be  (cheers).  Now,  this 
is  a  day  of  retrospect,  and  having  spoken 
of  Welsh  nationality,  I  am  reminded  to 
look  towards  that  inscription  which  you  see 
upon  a  portion  of  your  walls,  and  which 
bears  the  name  of  Henry  Richard— (hear, 
hear) — a  name  than  which  there  can  be  no 
better  symbol  of  Wales.  I  have  had  the 
honour  of  knowing  him  for  the  last  twenty 
years,  if  not  more,  and  I  have  always  been 
glad    to    take   occasion   to  say    that    I    re- 


garded him  in  respect  of  Wales,  in  respect 
of  the  conduct,  character,  faculties,  and 
hopes  of  the  people  of  Wales,  as  a  teacher 
of  and  a  guide.  I  have  owed  to  him  much 
of  what  I  have  learned  about  Wales,  as  my 
experience  has  enlarged,  and  I  owe  a  debt 
to  him  on  that  account,  which  I  am  ever 
glad  to  acknowledge." 

Those  are  respected  who  respect  them- 
selves, is  the  original  of  the  line  translated 
by  p<vo]iAi5  in  the  sixth  line  at  top,  and 
perhaps  there  was  never  a  better  comment 
upon  it  than  the  following  unanimous  re- 
commendation of  the  Royal  Commissioners 
on  Primary  Education  in  England.  We, 
too,  had  a  Royal  Commission  to  whom  Sir 
Patrick  Keenan  gave  reasons  as  cogent  as 
were  ever  given  for  the  education  of  Irish- 
speaking  children  through  the  medium  of 
the  Irish  ;  but  there  was  no  recommendation 
to  adopt  his  views,  and  why  the  difference 
in  treatment?  "  OitjeAnn  tne&f  <\i)i  n& 
■OAome,"  &c. 

"  (108.)  That  in  Wales  permission  should 
be  given  to  take  up  the  Welsh  language  as 
a  specific  subject ;  to  adopt  an  optional 
scheme  to  take  the  place  of  English  as  a 
class  subject,  founded  on  the  principle  of 
substituting  a  graduated  system  of  trans- 
lation from  Welsh  to  English,  for  the  pre- 
sent requirements  in  English  grammar  ;  to 
teach  Welsh  along  with  English  as  a  class 
subject ;  and  to  include  Welsh  among  the 
languages  in  which  candidates  for  Queen's 
scholarships  and  for  certificates  of  merit 
may  be  examined." 


HONOURING  A  PATRIOT  PRIEST. 

(Abridged  from  the  5ûoòìI.) 


The  celebration  of  the  twenty-fifth  anni- 
versary of  the  ordination  of  the  Rev.  Patrick 
Hennessy  (St.  Patrick's  Church,  Jersey  City) 
to  the  priesthood  was  the  occasion  of  bring- 
ing together  thousands  of  his  admiring 
friends  from  far  and  near,  bishops,  priests 
(over  a  hundred),  and  laics  of  all  denomi- 
nations, on  May  30th. 

After  the  other  proceedings,  the  Rev. 
Thomas  Fitzgerald,  Brooklyn,  ascended  the 
pulpit   and,  in    a    clear,   distinct,   eloquent

THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL.

I  had  intended  to  insert  in  this  issue  of 
the  journal  a  dialogue  in  Irish,  as  it  is 
spoken  in  Waterford,  i.e.,  as  spoken  in  East 
Munster  generally — in  East  Cork,  Water- 
ford,  and  the  adjoining  portions  of  Kil- 
kenny and  Tipperary  ;  but  I  think  the  fol- 
lowing, from  the  American  Gaodhal,  better 
than  anything  that  I,  or  anyone  I  know, 
could  write.

VOCABULARY,  IDIOMS,  AND  LOCAL 
PECULIARITIES. 
A  gentleman,  who  is  a  ripe  Irish  scholar,  though  he 
does  not  speak  the  language,  wrote  to  me  lately  to  say  that 
he  is  sometimes  puzzled  in  trving  to  understand  what  I 
think  so  plain  as  not  to  require  explanation  :  this  lesson 
I  will  to  explain  clearly  enough,  even  for  the  comprehen- 
sion of  beginners. 

(1)  paopac,  g.  -paig,  a  proper  name,  Power  ;  in  Mini- 
ster, the  final  5,  in  many  cases,  is  pronounced 
as  g  unaspirated  :  Apaoriaig  an  cpovoe,  O  Power 
of  my  heart. 

(2)  poitic=rtoinn,  a  share.   laeceanca  =  laeceaT>.  gen.

imipm  Tunc,  or  e  tj'innpn  Tunc,  TJ  innpiii=T>o 
innpin,  inf.  of  mmp,  tell.  By  speakers,  and  by 
many  writers,  too,  in  Ireland,  and  still  more  in 
Scotland,  the  particle  tjo,  sign  of  the  inf.  mood,  is 
incorporated  with  the  verb,  as  if  they  were  a  simple 
word,  and  a  =  T>o  is  put  before  the  verb,  aspirating 
the  T>  as  in  a  Tutinpinc,  above. 

(4)  50  •oe'n  (-oe  an)  c-ácap,  what  was  the  joy  — how

THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


[I  think  the  Gaelic  Journal  is  to  be  con- 
gratulated on  its  correspondents  at  least. 
It  was  conjectured  in  Xo.  27  of  the  journal 
that  the  last  stanza  in  Curnane's  song  was 
by  another  hand,  and  this  correspondent 
shows  whence  that  stanza,  as  well  as  the 
second  in  the  song,  were  derived.]

THE  PEARL  OF  THE  WHITE 
BREAST. 

There's  a  colleen  fair  as  May, 

For  a  year  and  for  a  day 

I  have  sought  by  ev'ry  way, — Her  heart  to 

gain. 
There's  no  art  of  tongue  or  eye, 
Fond  youths  with  maidens  try, 
But    I've  tried   with  ceaseless   sigh, — Yet 

tried  in  vain. 
If  to  France,  or  far-off  Spain, 
She'd  cross  the  watery  main, 
To  see  her  face  again, — The  seas  I'd  brave. 
And  if 'tis  heaven's  decree 
That  mine  she  may  not  be, 
May  the  Son  of  Mary  me— In  mercy  save. 

Oh,  thou  blooming  milk-white  dove, 

To  whom  I've  given  true  love, 

Do  not  ever  thus  reprove — My  constancy. 

There  are  maidens  would  be  mine, 

With  wealth  in  hand  and  kine, 

If  my   heart  would   but   incline — To  turn 

from  thee. 
But  a  kiss,  with  welcome  bland, 
And  touch  of  thy  fair  hand, 
Are   all   that  I'd  demand, — Wouldst  thou 

not  spurn  ? 
For  if  not  mine,  dear  girl, 
Oh,  Snowy-breasted  Pearl ! 
May    I    never   from   the    Fair — With    life 

return  !

PECULIAR  LOCALISMS. 

Dear  Mr.  Fleming — Please  allow  me  so  send  you  a 
few  words  and  phrases  for  the  journal,  which  are  in  daily 
use  here  in  Dalriada,  north  of  County  Antrim,  known 
also  by  the  name  of  the  Rowte,  Route,  Ruta,  Rutach,  &c. 

1.  (?«/.— When  a  cow  calves  they  immediately  ask, 
"  is  it  a  qui  ?  "  meaning  is  it  a  heifer  calf  she  has  had. 
The  i  is  in  qui  sounded  like  the  personal  pronoun  I.  For 
instance,  my  own  cow  has  had  five  quis  or  quois  in  suc- 
cession.    Is  it  from  Gaelic  ? 

2.  Lippin.—\  couldn't  lippin  him  ;  that  is,  I  could  not 
not  trust  him.  She  wouldn't  lippin  me  with  anything  ; 
that  is,  she  would  not  entrust  me  with  anything.  I  how- 
ever came  upon  this  word  in  O'Reilly's  Irish  Dictionary, 
which  is  tipin,  trusting  to,  confiding  in.  Lipui  (lipeen), 
the  same  author  says,  is  a  small  measure  in  Scotland  called 
a  lippie. 

3.  MUliŷŷin. — This  word  means  to  neglect,  as,  he 
mislippins  his  work.  He  mislippened  the  message  or 
errand  he  got. 

4.  Dellegon. — This  means  the  light  between  day  and 
night — twilight.  It  is  like  day-light-gone,  three  syllables, 
but  the  second  one  very  short.  They  were  not  home  till 
delligun.  They  ate  their  supper  at  dellegun,  that  is,  at 
twilight. 

5.  Chiuc  or  ciuc.  A  ciuc  is  a  hook  or  sickle  to  shear 
or  cut  grass  or  corn  with.  There  is  a  difficulty  in  pro- 
nouncing this  word,  as  the  first  c  or  ch  is  sounded  like  the 
c  aspirated  in  Irish,  and  the  i  next  it  is  very  short.  "  Go 
and  get  me  the  ciuk  till  I  shear  some  grass." 

6.  Skcec  or  skeech.  The  c  or  ch  in  this  word  has  the 
aspirate  or  guttural  sound,  as  in  Irish.  It  means  ready 
to  fly  away  or  run  off;  as,  that  horse  is  very sceec  (skeec) 
on  it.  Vrou  need  not  bridle  or  curb  me,  I'm  not  so  very 
sceec,  that  is,  I  am  not  going  to  run  off. 

7.  Kiddacs. — This  is  a  word  used  bj-  a  County  Down 
woman  residing  in  this  locality,  and  means  duds,  gar- 
ments. "  I  have  too  many  kiddacs  or  kiddags  on  me  ;" 
said  when  a  lot  of  duds  are  worn  or  wrapped  about  the 
head  and  shoulders.  This  is,  no  doubt,  an  Irish  word, 
for  O'Reilly's  diet,  has  Cioeóg,  a  blanket,  a  poor 
coverlet. 


S.  Farlans. — When  one  is  eating  very  heartily,  it  is 
said,  "You  are  for  filling  the  farlanes  to-day."  What 
inside  nooks  or  crannies  are  meant  by  it    I  do  not  know. 

9.  How  is  the  Irish  word,  a  nurru  (last  year)  spelled? 
Also  a  nurrihur,  meaning  aftertomorrow  I  have  heard 
the  latter  expressed  by  an  óirhir,  i.e.,  aftermorrow,  in 
Glenbush  here. 

10.  Cpantiaoil — This  word  is  given  in  last  journal  at 
page  67,  and  not  in  O'R's  diet.  I  heard  an  old  Irish 
speaking  woman  of  Renadtiompan,  County  Waterford, 
say  it  meant  a  hearse. 

11.  Catlap  or  cauas.  I  have  not  been  able  to  find  this 
word  in  books,  and  do  no  know  the  correct  spelling 
thereof.  It  was  used  by  Rody  Walsh,  of  Shanballyanne, 
County  Waterford,  in  this  way,  'nuaip  a  bi  an  capb 
a  'cauap,  that  is,  when  the  lull  was  bellowing  and  lifting 
tufts  of  earth  with  his  fore  leg.  It  appears  to  mean  the 
peculiar  noise  or  challenge  the  bull  was  making. 

12.  De  r.oum,  cá  pe,  purpose  he  is,  and  Dhoomas  or 
dumas,  feigning,  pretending,  I  am  unable  to  find.

USEFUL   JOTTINGS. 
(Rev.  Eugene  O'Growney.) 

1.  Cliuaiẅ  niéabaile  =  I  went  home.  What  is  the 
a  here,  and  why  is  the  b  of  baile  aspirated  ? 

The  idea  of  "home"  is  expressed  in  Irish  by  an  baile, 
a  phrase  that  literally  might  be  translated  "  the  village." 
"  At  home"  is  nip  an  m-batle,  annp  an  111-baile.  There 
is  no  danger  of  confounding  "at  home"  with  "in  the 
village,"  for  this  latter  phrase  isaip  an  m. baile,  as  in  the 
song  :— 

Cá  cailin  aip  an  m-baile  po 

<\p  ab  ainni  •oi-pi  tllaipe. 
"  To  home"  then,  would  naturally  be  'oo'ii  baile,  or 
cum  an  baile,  and  this  second  form  would  become  un  a' 
baile  or  '11a  baile  in  the  spoken  language,  at  least,  of 
Ulster  and  Connaught.  This  is  not  mere  conjecture,  for 
'na  baile  is  the  form  used  in  lump  eogani.  In  all 
probability,  therefore,  a  baile  is  what  remain  of  cum  an 
baile,  and  this  will  explain  the  a  and  the  aspiration. 

2.  *\p  earning  (hangee)  pé  leac  is  the  West-Con- 
naught  pronunciation  of  what  is  commonly  spelled  ap 
caicníg  (hahnee)  pé  leac.     Why  this  pronunciation  ? 

Caicnnni  and  caicneac  are  the  forms  of  the  verb  and 

adjective  used   by  Scotch   Gaels   in   Ulster,  and    North 

Connaught.     From  the  verb  come  caicneam  and  caic- 

nearhac  ;  from  caicneac  is  formed  caicingim.     In  all 

these  words  the — en — was  found   to   be  a  rather  harsh 

sound,    and    was     changed    to   on,   and     this    became 

nn   as  usual,  just  as  fmJTone=fltme  has  become  tmnnne 

in  Meath.     It  appears  to  be  a  mistake  then  to  aspirate  the 

second  c  of  these  words,  for  in  all  places  where  11  and  1111 

are  pronounced  correctly,  canmijnn  tic,  and  not  caic- 

11151111,  &c,  are  the  words  heard.     What  spelling  should 

be  adopted,  caicmjmi,  caictngmi  or  caniingim  ?     This 

is  a  question  for  Irish  scholars  to  answer.

as  50  o-ci  an  Chaip5,  50   t>-ci  was  se.n  to  be  equivalent 

to  a  pneposition  (=  until,  till),  and  so  instead  of  being 

regarded  as  a  verb  followed  by  its  nominative,  it  began  to 

be  used  as  an  ordinary  preposition  (  =  till ;    to)  followed 


THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


I)y  the  dative.  This  is  evidently  a  wrong  use  of  the 
phrase.  Indeed,  in  the  best  Irish-speaking  districts  of 
Connaught,  50  Ti-ri  is  yet  followed  I >y  the  nominative. 

It  is  evident  also  that  the  use  of  550  o-üi  should  as  far 
as  possible  be  restricted  to  cases  where  it  would  preserve 
its  true  meaning — 50  Tj-ciocparo.  Such  uses  of  it  as  in 
cÁimc  pe  50  •o-ci  mé,  are  uncalled  for ;  there  is  no  lack 
of  suitable  prepositions. 

The  same  future  of  cigirn  is  yet  used  in  another  phrase, 
put  &  •o-ci  =  pul  a  D-ciocparo  ;  where  fill  ä  oti  has 
come  to  be  used  as  a  preposition  =  poirh.  Hence  put  a 
•o-ci  bp.ro  =  before  long.  This  is  not  very  good  Irish,  for 
Vip.ro  is  not  a  noun,  but  the  remains  of  1  Dp<ro  an  adverb. 
However,  it  is  preferable  to  put  1  bp<vo  which  is  heard 
also, and  in  which  put  is  incorrectly  used  as  a  preposition. 


A  VOORNEEN   DEELISH. 

The  moment  was  sad   when  my  love  and  I 
parted, 

A  voorneen  deelish,  Eileen  Og. 
As  I  kissed  off  her  tears,  I  was  nigh  broken- 
hearted, 

A  voorneen  deelish,  Eileen  Og  ; 
Wan    was   her  cheek,  which  hung  on   my 

shoulder; 
Damp    was    her    hand — no    marble    was 

colder ; 
I  felt  that  I  never  again  should  behold  her, 
A  voorneen  deelish,  Eileen  Og. 

When    the    "word  of  command"  put  our 
troops  into  motion, 

A  voorneen  deelish,  Eileen  Og, 
I   buckled  on   my  knapsack,  to  cross    the 
wide  ocean, 

A  voorneen  deelish,  Eileen  Og  ; 
Brisk  were    our    troops — all    roaring    like 

thunder, 
Pleased    with    the    voyage — impatient    for 

plunder — 
I  felt  that  my  heart  was  nigh  torn  asunder, 
A  voorneen  deelish,  Eileen  Og. 

Long  I  fought  for  my  country,  far,  far  from 
my  true  love, 

A  voorneen  deelish,  Eileen  Og  ; 
All  my  pay  and  my  booty   I  hoarded  for 
you,  love, 

A  voorneen  deelish,  Eileen  Og. 
Peace  being  proclaimed,  I  escaped  from  the 

slaughter, 
Landed  at  home — my  sweet  girl,  I  sought 

her — 
But  sorrow,  alas !    to  the  cold    grave   had 
brought  her, 

A  voorneen  deelish,  Eileen  Og.

THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


NOTES,  QUERIES.— REPLIES  TO.  I. 

The  following  replies  have  been  received  from  Irish 
scholars  as  to  the  use  of  the  words  in  the  margin  in  their 
respective  localities  ;  a  better  omen  still  for  the  preser- 
vation of  the  Irish  language  is  that  young  students  who 
are  not  themselves  Irish  speakers  have  enquired  from  old 
Irish-speaking  people  in  respect  of  the  meaning  of  these 
words.  [We  would  request  from  Mr.  Brady  and  Mr. 
Lynch  an  occasional  poem  or  song  or  story — any  plain, 
simple  ones  still  in  the  memory  of  the  people  ;  difficult 
ones  are  not  so  necessary.]

Srpó  <\  VeAp   5A11    4111111,   from   the   modern 

Babylon  has  sent  a  distich  with  its 
translation  exemplifying  the  meaning 
attached  to  the  word  in  Journal  No.  29. 
A  woman  not  recognising  her  hus- 
band who  had  been  long  absent  said  to 
him  on  his  return  :  — 

"Hi    opm   bu-ô  cóip  xmic   pcpó   a 
cuip  peat, 
11i  cuippinn  pAÍ  o'  cotiiAtp  acc  do

"  It  would  not  be  right  for  you  now  to 
venture  on  bold  freedoms  with  me.     I 
would  judge  of  you  from  your  appear- 
ance to  be  nothing  but  an  honest  man." 
We  solicit  further  favours  from  this  cor- 
respondent.    Mr.  Stanton  says  :   "  All 
over   East   Cork,  pcpó   •oo   cinp    Aip 
means   simply   to   speak  to,  or  salute 
a  person."    In  Kerry,  according  to  Mr. 
Lynch,  pcpó   is  an  extravagant,  stray- 
ing expedition.     Perhaps  "dissipation" 
is  a  better  meaning  than  extravagance, 
which  is  the  word  in  diets.

[A  friend,  wdio  is  an  unselfish  friend  of  the  Irish  lan- 
guage, said  to  me  :  You  and  Mr.  Russell  can  say  bitter 
things  of  each  other,  but  will  they  serve  the  Irish  lan- 
guage ?  In  deference  to  my  friend's  opinion,  I  recast  my 
reply  to  Mr.  Russell's  letters ;  I  attempted  to  say  the 
mildest  things,  but  after  a  considerable  loss  of  time  and 
labour,  I  find  that  the  most  bitter  things  I  can  say  of  these 
letters  is  to  quote  them.  The  open  letter  was  treated  of 
in  the  G.J.,  No.  2S  ;  the  extracts  from  it  in  this  article 
are  marked  a,  l>,  &c.  His  second  letter,  the  corrected 
one,  was  crushed  out  of  the  journal — it  will  be  given  in 
the  next — the  extracts  from  it  are  marked  j3,  k2,  &c] 


DOES  Clmm  ALWAYS  TAKE  THE  GEN.  CASE 
AFTER  IT? 

This  is  the  second  of  Mr.  Russell's  issues,  and  the 
one  that  has  mostly  given  rise  to  the  bitterness  reproved 
by  my  friend.  I  would  very  willingly  let  the  matter  drop  ; 
but  too  much  capital  has  been  made  out  of  Mr.  Russell's 
letters  by  those  who  would  use  them  for  a  purpose  that  he, 
you  would  imagine,  cannot  be  pleased  with.  A  good 
many  of  our  readers  will  recollect  that  Mr.  Russell  raised 
this  discussion  in  November,  1SS3,  if  not  sooner.  To  put 
an  end  to  this  controversy,  I  will  try  and  make  the  matter 
so  plain  that  our  beginners  can  understand  it  : — (a.)  cum 
is  a  compd.  prep.,  and  in  Irish  compd.  prepositions  take 
after  them  a  gen.  case  of  nouns.  In  Irish,  too,  "the  in- 
finitive mood  of  active  verbs  ....  takes  the  accus. 
case  when  the  noun  is  placed  before  it." — O'Don.,  Ir.  Gr., 
p.  3S4.  Here,  then,  are  two  rules  of  grammar  clashing — ■ 
how  can  they  be  reconciled?  <X  boAti  CAomce,  at  Bally- 
douagh,  parish  of  Clomnult,  county  of  Cork,  said  over  the 
mortal  remains  of  a  friend,  that  her's  "  was  the  expert 
hand  in  parlour  or  in  kitchen  to  salt  butter  or  meat,"  &c. 
"  Chum  Í111 110  peoib  t>o  pAilleAW."  1tn  and  peoil  are  in 
the  accus.  before  the  inf.  no  pAiLleAO.  They  should  be 
genitives  after  cum,  said  Mr.  Russell,  in  1S83  ;  and  he  re- 
peated this  in  the  open  letter,  and  he  asserted  that  Dr. 
O'Donovan  was  on  his  side.  We  have  seen  above  a  por- 
tion of  what  O'Donovan  said.  (J.)  In  the  following  page, 
3S5,  O'Donovan  added  that  when  a  prep,  went  before  a 
verb  in  the  infin.,  some  writers  would  make  the  noun 
between  the  prep,  and  the  verb  be  governed  by  the  prep., 


THE   GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


but  tins  is  not  to  be  approved  of,  for  it  would  be  evidently 
better  to  leave  the  noun  under  the  government  of  the  inf. 
mood,  as  it  would  be  in  the  absence  of  the  prep,  and 
consider  the  prep,  as  governing  the  clause  of  the  sentence 
which  follows  it.  O'Donovan  had  said  this  before  at  p 
364  of  his  grammar,  and  very  nearly  in  the  same  words  as 
the  above.  Let  the  reader  bear  this  in  mind.  The  beoui 
c-ioince  mentioned  above,  had  it  suited  her  rhyme,  would 
have  said— cum  ime  no  veoU  -oo  i-.nlle.yo,  and  (,/) 
O  Donovan  says,  p.  386,  "  That  both  modes  of  construc- 
tion are  allowable,  like  the  gerunds  and  gerundives  in 
Latin.  Such  an  expression  as  "In  order  to  make  peace," 
would  be  expressed  in  Latin  by  the  gerund,  "ad  ŷetendum 
pacem,  or  by  the  gerundive,  "  ad  ỳetendam  pacem.  The 
two  expressions  are  equally  correct  and  intelligible  So 
in  Irish  are  the  two  expressions,  cum  peoil  00  failAeoíô 
or  cum  reóU  no  faille-vo.  In  Latin  the  gerundive  is 
reckoned  the  more  elegant,  and,  therefore,  it  is  in  more  com- 
mon use.  So  m  Irish  the  gen.  after  cum  sounds  much  better 
than  the  accus.,  and  is,  therefore,  more  often  employed 
by  the  best  writers.  Hence,  Mr.  Russell  would  notallow 
the  accus.  at  all  after  cum  before  the  infinitive.  This 
doctrine  I  could  not  agree  to,  seeing  that  Father  Donlevy 
i.Sre,,-  ^n,-,-after  éum  in  a  certain  expression,  and  that 
William  Williams  employed  the  accusative  in  the  i,h»í 
expression.  This  I  stated  five  years  ago.  At  the  end  of 
four  years  Mi.  Russell  comes  again  on  the  scene  with  his 
open  letters,  and  this  time  he  cites  O'Donovan  in  the

O  Donovan  I  fad  to  understand,  with  O'Donovan's  gr 
in  his  hands,  and  how  he  has  allowed  nine  months  to 
pass  over  without  excusing  or  palliating  hi,  misstatement, 
is  one  of  the  curiosities  ol  literature.  Rut  the  man  who 
asserted  before  the  world  U^iyve  and  one  are  ««imust  be 
held  excused.  The  last  passage  in  the  quotation  below  is 
from  the  corrected  letter. 

i^'tJ'  ,"Acco«ling  to  the' best  writers  of  Gaelic 
(Irish),  and  according  to  a  rule  of  Gaelic  (Irish)  that  no 
one  but  some  one  of  little  learning  and  <neat  'brass' 
ever  doubted.".  .  .  Most  writer,  on  grammar  laid  it 
down  as  a  rule  that  cum  governs  the  gen.  O'Donovan, 
Joyce  and  Windisch  (and  they  are  considered  the  best 
certainly  say  so)  ;  they  say  nothing  about  exceptions  to  this 
rule,  and  it  is  to  be  presumed  because  there  are  no  excep- 
tions (the  italics  are  mine).  "  You  have  not  produced 
a  single  instance  [in  the  art.,  No.  2S]ofthe  use  of  the 
accusative  after  cum  but  one,  and  that  is  from  the  work  of 
a  friar,  who  must  have  been  obscure,  as  you  do  not  seem 
to  know  his  name. 

Yes,  he  was  obscure  ;  a  calced  Carmelite,  and  a  prior  of 
his  convent;  but  he  only  wrote  his  initials,  T  O'C  He  was 
too  much  engaged  "in  sounding  the  trumpet  of  Heaven  " 
to  have  any  concern  in  the  blowing  of  his  own  "Who 
builds  a  church  to  God  and  not  to  fame,  will  never  mark 
a  marble  with  his  name."  Still  a  man  competent  to  turn 
some  hundreds  of  pages  from  the  French  into  idiomatic 
Irish  is  a  good  authority.  Besides  this  obscure  friar  I 
quoted  an  "instance"  from  O'Donovan,  who  had  taken 
it  approvingly  from  Stewart.  I  quoted  William  Williams; 
I  quoted  the  sermon,  or  rather  Mr.  Russell  quoted  it  foi 
me;  and  I  quoted  the  grammar  of  the  General  Assembly 
of  Ireland  a  work  mentioned  by  O 'Don.  Ir.  Gr.,  Int  p 
lxiv.  Father  Smiddy  I  omit,  as  the  example  in  his 
catechism  is  doubtful. 

I  once  heard  the  celebrated  ventriloquist,  Gallagher 
attempt  to  reckon  the  companions  who  were  with  him  at 
a  convivial  party  the  preceding  night— "The  two 
Maguire  s  are  one,  Sir  William  Blank  is  two,  and  myself

he  employed  his  fingers  ;  but  all  to  no  purpose,  he  could 
only  find  the  three.  I  believe  I  could  account  for  the 
cause  of  the  error  in  Mr.  Gallagher's  computation,  but  I 
fail  to  see  how  Mr.  Russell  contrived  to  "roll  into  one  " 
the  six  high  authorities  I  had  cited.  Mr.  Russell  has 
not  corrected  his  mistake  in  any  of  subsequent  letters 
though  six  long  months  have  passed  away  since  he  wrote 
that  passage. 

Are  these  six  authorities  sufficient  for  our  purpose? 
Here  are  a  few  others.  In  1819,  Patrick  Den,  of  Cappo- 
qum,  published  a  phonetic  translation  of  "Think  Well 
On  t,  in  which,  at  page  10,  he  wrote-"  Chun  tu  havairt 
chun  seilv  siorrmye  dfail"  (cum  cu  feaWr;  cum 
reilb  pojipue  o'fýil);  and  in  his  "Religious 
I  rimer  (Mulcahy,  Cork,  185S),  p.  12,  we  find  :  "  Chum 
breüheamhuus  do  thabhairt."  This  expression  we  find 
teeralfym  St  Patrick's  Prayer  Book,  p.  12,  and  in  Father 
Conway  s  Short  Catechism,"  p.  5.  Morty  Kelleher,  in 
1, 92,  trans  ated  phonetically,  "Butler's  Catechism" 
(White,  Cork),  and  at  p.  44  in  it  we  find  "Chun  bas  aqus 
paisn  arslanahorachoingavil  in  ar  neentin  (cum  bar  a?us 
p«ir ,-np  SUmnjceón,  con5bi,l  ,„  *p  „.,„„[„,»). 
Another  translation  into  Irish  of  "Think  Well  On't  " 
was  made  by  Eugene  O'Cavanagh  (Dublin:  Coyne,  1S20) 
and  he  wrote  at  p.  200- "Is  leor  e  chum  ceart  De  dó 
shasamh  ;  and  in  the  same  page  he  has  the  other  form- 
chum  leoirghmomlia  do  dheanamh  in  ar  bpeacadhaibh 
lather  Paul  O'Brien  and  Edward  O'Reill/ recommend 
this  translation.  The  passage  from  the  Keener  I  have 
given  already  To-day  another  passage  in  point  has  come 
in  my  way.  This  line  was  written  by  Thomas  Gleeson,  a 
poet  of  Clare  or  Limerick,  in  the  last  century:  "cum 
5tv<vmuir5  an  be^U,  n&  tnéipl.15  t>o  ÔÚ01."  I  am 
sure  I  could  find  similar  examples  in  the  writings  of  all 
our  poets  had  I  time  or  inclination  to  search  for  them 

But  the  best  authority  of  ail  to  show  that  the  two  ex- 
pressions are  used  indifferently  is  one  that  .Mr  Russell 
little  suspects  and  one,  I  think,  that  will  astonish  him, 
This  work  isthe  (a)  Lucema  Fidelium  of  Father  O'Mollov 
a  book  to  which  Mr.  Russell  has,  in  a  special  manner,' 
appealed,  and  of  which  he  says  in  the  open  letter  that  it 
is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  most  correct  books  ever 
published  in  Gaelic  (Irish).  This  is  a  work  of  nearly  400 
pages,  and  Mr.  Russell  not  only  read  the  work  attentively 
but  he  has  collected  from  it  all  the  passages  in  which 
cum,  followed  by  a  gen.  is  found,  before  a  verb  of  the 
inhn.  mood— some  twenty  or  thirty  in  number,  which  he 
printed  in  a  third  letter  to  the  Irish  American.  He  has 
also  found  1,1  the  book  some  three  passages  in  which  cum 
is  followed  by  an  accus.  I  have  found  two  other  such 
passages  in  the  book  of  cum  followed  by  an  accus  —one 
at  p.  31  cum  an  rpiap-vo  tUo.ii  -oo  ceacc,  and  the  other 
at  p.  296,  x>o  cum  pc  ^on  .npce.^1  eile  tjo  cnemea- 
mmn  :  and  these  five  accusatives  Mr.  Russell  has  pro- 
nounced errors  of  the  press,  caused  by  the  printers  beiiio- 
ignorant  of  Irish.  That  is  to  say,  Father  O'Mollov 
wrote  hve  nouns  in  the  gen.  sing,  correctly,  and  the  igno- 
rant printers,  by  chance,  changed  them  to  five  accusatives 
without  misplacing  a  single  letter  in  them,  a  feat  that  thev 
would  not  do  until  the  millenium.  These  words  are 
spread  through  a  book  of  nearly  400  pages ;  and  Mr 
Russell  has  persuaded  himself  that  five  words  have  been 
altered  by  chance,  from  one  case  to  another,  correctly 
it  would  be  just  as  rational  to  suppose  that  the  MS.  or 
the  printed  book  has  grown  out  of  the  ground  like  a  mush 
room.  And  what  reason  does  Mr.  Russell  give  for  those 
extraordinary  changes  ?  This-that  three  other  words  in 
the  book  are  misprints  and,  ergo,  the  five  accusatives  are 
misprints  also.  But  the  most  singular  part  of  the  affair 
is  that  none  of  these  three  words  is  a  misprint  either

they  are  three  nouns  in  the  dat.  plur.  after  cum  ;  and 
according  to  Mr.  Russell  they  must  have  been  originally 
gen.  plural,  and  changed  by  ignorant  printers,  by  chanct, 
to  their  present  forms  without  making  a  mistake  even  in 
one  letter.  The  fact  is.  Father  O'Molloy  wrote  these 
three  datives  plural  also  as  they  are  printed.  O'Donovan, 
Ir.  Gr.  p.  2S9,  says,  "Chum  or  co  cum,  to,  unto, 
for  the ŷurposi  of.  Sometimes  [it  is]  used  for  the  simple 
prep.  '00.  /<>,  after  a  verb  of  motion."  In  the  three 
examples  in  tlie  '*  Lucerna  Fidtlitmi"  cum  is  used  for  the 
simple  prep.  A',  and  Father  O'Molloy  wrote  the  datives 
after  it,  just  as  they  are  printed.  Since  the  hook  was 
printed,  in  1676,  the  printers,  had  they  been  constantly  at 
work,  would  not,  by  any  chance,  have  changed  the  three 
genitives  into  three  datives  plural.  Mr.  Russell  is  a  prac- 
tical man  of  business,  and  would,  at  a  glance,  have  seen 
the  absurdity  of  imagining  that  these  alterations  could  be 
made,  had  any  other  subject  been  under  discussion  ;  but 
having  set  his  heart  on  establishing  his  theory,  he  has  per- 
suaded himself,  and  would  persuade  others,  of  the  truth 
of  a  miracle.  Father  O'Molloy,  also,  uses  the  accusative 
case  of  personal  pronouns  after  cum  before  the  inf.  ;  as 
"  00  cum  cu  pern  'oo  coptiAm,"  p.  302  (and  we  have  seen 
that  Patrick  Den  said  above  cum  úu  rJAbAipc).  Other 
compound  prepositions,  too,  Father  O'Molloy  has  used  like 
turn,  to  govern  both  cases,  as  art  ci  m'pAOtprotn  t>o 
•òeAtiAm,  p.  172  ;  Atp  ci  cuivvp  An  CijeApiiA  •oo  jlacA-ó, 
p.  116.  I  hope  now  that  Mr.  Russell  is  satisfied  that 
cum  can  govern  different  cases,  and  that  Father  O'Molloy 
has  put  the  gen.  dat.  and  accusative  cases  after  it. 

j2  .  This  paragraph  is  so  confused  that  one  does  not 
well  know  where  or  how  to  begin  with  it.  Stewart  did 
not  make  an  erroneous  quotation  from  the  Scotch  Gaelic 
Bible,  and  O'Donovan  knew  well  that  he  did  not ;  for 
O'Donovan,  as  well  as  Stewart,  gave  the  dale  of  the  pub- 
lication of  tlie  Scotch  Gaelic  Bible,  from  which  the  quota- 
tion was  taken,  1767,  because  the  text,  "  Iuath  chum  fuil 
a  dhorladh  "  has  been  since  changed  in  this  Scolch  Bible, 
but  not  changed  as  Mr.  Russell  gives  it.  The  other 
extract  from  Exod.  xxv.  27,  which  Mr.  Russell  says  isnot 
much  better  Gaelic  than  it  is  Sanscrit,  is  still  in  the 
Scotch  Gaelic  Bible.  And  it  is  about  as  wise  a  proceeding 
to  compare  these  phrases  with  those  in  Bedel's  Bible,  as 
with  the  corresponding  ones  in  the  Septuagent  edition. 
The  date  of  the  publication  of  the  Bible  is  noteworthy  for 
another  reason — because  the  Scotch  did  not  begin  to  cor- 
rupt their  language  lor  Iwent)  years  after  that  date  (1767), 
according  to  Mr.  Russell,  therefore,  it  would  follow,  that 
the  quotation  was  correct — in  other  words,  was  good  Irish. 
As  t<.  the  corruptions  of  their  language  by  the  modern 
Scotch,  we  surely  can  beat  them  still.  No  book  in  their 
language  can  show  nearly  six  score  errors  as  the  Pursuit 
ofDiarmuid  and  Grainne,  Fait  I.,  can  in  a  few  pages. 
Mr.  Russell  is  well  aware  that  O'Donovan  goes  almost 
out  of  his  way  to  piaise  Stewart  in  different  places  of  his 
grammar.  One  thing  is  certain,  at  any  rate,  that 
O'Donovan  was  as  little  inclined  to  napping  when  quoting 
Stew  an,  as  at  any  tune  ot   his  life. 

Having  cleared  the  way,  we  are  now  in  a  position  fairly 
!  1  s  what  Mr.  Russell  deems  the  most  imp.. riant 
point  in  this  question,  lie  says  (b)  "  This  is  not  a  matter 
of  spelling,  or  even  like  the  government  of  other  eases  of 
nouns  .  .  .  for  the  misuse  ol  the  governing  power 
01  cum  may  lead  to  ambiguity."  (d)  "  '  CnatiAIC  me  Aim 
po  cum  peŵp"oopliórJA,ò,'erronously  means  'I  came  here 
l>.  man)    a  man  ;'  correctly,  '  I  came  here  to  many  nun, 

.  .  1  came  here  to  many  the  man,  was  translated 
'  CA11A1C  me  Aim  po  cum  An  pip  00  pop  aẃ.'  " 

h-  "  When  different  forms  of  expression  convey  the  same 
meaning,  no  harm  is  dune,  but  in  the  instance  of  cum,  no 


looseness  can  be  admitted.  It  either  governs  the  gen.  or 
it  does  not  ;  if  it  governs  it  in  one  instance  I  can  hardly 
see  how  it  can  fail  to  govern  it  in  every  instance.  I  asked 
more  than  a  dozen  men  from  Clare,  Cork,  and  Kerry, 
what  was  the  meaning  of  the  phrase  cum  An  pip  00 
pópAẄ,  and  they  all  answered  unhesitatingly  '  to  marry  a 
m, in  ,•'     '  cum    peAp   '00  pópAẄ'    must  mean   to  '  marry 

And  is  it  Thomas  O'Neill  Russell  that  tells  me  twice 
over  that  "cum  An  pip  no  pópÄÒ,"  means  "to  marry  a 
man  " — tells  me,  that  more  than  a  dozen  men  from  Clare, 
Cork,  and  Kerry  unhesitatingly  translated  it  so,  and  tells 
me  this  twice  in  the  course  of  a  few  lines,  and  in  a  letter 
corrected  by  himself !  Now,  I  tell  Mr.  O'Neill  Russell 
that  the  persons  who  said  so  were  men  in  buckram  ;  men 
who  never  spoke  a  sentence  in  good  Irish.  No  Irish  speaker 
ever  yet  said  it — 'cum  An  pip  T>o  pópATJ,'  is  'to  marry 
THE  man."  50  b-póiprá  wia  Atp  ah  njAe-oeibje.  The 
dozen  may  at  once  be  put  out  of  court ;  but  for  the  sake  of 
the  learners  we  must  finish  the  paper.  The  dozen  men 
whom  /  cited  spoke  and  wrote  to  and/»;-  the  people — to 
instruct  the  people,  not  to  establish  a  theory  :  they  all 
used  both  forms  in  writing  and  in  speaking.  No  one  ever 
misunderstood  them.  One  of  them,  the  author  of  the 
grammar  for  the  General  Assembly  in  Ireland,  made  use 
of  an  expression  identical  in  construction  and  almost  in 
words  with  the  phrase  "cum  An  peAp  t>o  pópATJ."  He 
wrote  :  "  èAÍrnc  pé  cum  Art  peAp  ■oo  buALyô,"  and  him- 
self translated  it :  "  He  came  in  order  or  wdth  intent  to 
strike  the  man  :"  no  ambiguity  here.  Mr.  Russell  said  to 
his  iiiiii — "cum  ah  pip  -oo  popAtì;"  but  he  did  not  say, 
"cum  An  peAp  t>o  pófÄÔ ;"  had  he  done  so,  perhaps, 
they  would  have  done  better. 

When  those  wdiose  "education  had  been  neglected" 
sit  down  with  grammars,  dictionaries,  &c,  they  get  on 
fairly  ;  they  look  into  their  authorities  for  any  difficulty. 
In  easy  things  they  blunder,  for  they  depend  on  them- 
selves. Can  it  be  possible  that  such  was  Mr.  Russell's 
case  in  the  last  blunders  above  ?  Mr.  R.  J.  O'Duffy  had 
to  «rite  two  words  in  the  vocabulary  to  D.  and  Grainne, 
Part  I.  <ibAC,  a  dwarf,  and  AbAc,  entrails.  Trusting  to 
himself,  he  wrote  the  two  words  as  one,  thus  :  "  <XbAC, 
.f.  ;//.,  the  entrails  ;  gen.  aVjaic,  a  dwarf,  a  sprite,  a  bpuice 
jli.ir,  Bruithe,  the  dwarf."  Such  are  our  Irish  scholars  ! 
No  wonder  they  should  shield  one  another;  fellow-feeling 
makes  us  wondrous  kind.

TO  THE  MEMBERS  OF  THE  SOCIETY  FOR 
THE  PRESERVATION  OF  THE  IRISH  LAN- 
GUAGE. 

Gentlemen — In  some  city  in  old  times  it  was  pro- 
posed to  have  slaves  known  by  a  certain  badge,  but  the 
motion  was  rejected  on  the  ground  that  it  would  be 
dangerous  to  let  them  know  how  numerous  they  were.  I 
fear  it  is  dangerous  to  the  interests  of  the  old  tongue  to 
let  those  who  affect  to  love  it  for  need,  or  greed,  or  vanity! 
know  that  there  are  so  many  of  their  kind  in  the  world.  To 
know  Irish  well  a  person  must  be  a  scholar,  and  he  must 
have  a  colloquial  knowledge  of  the  language,  as  in 
the  case  of  every  other  language.  An  ignorant  man 
cannot  write  or  speak  well  on  any  subject,  certainly 
not  in  Irish.  And  with  the  best  opportunities  it  requires 
years  on  years  of  study  to  learn  a  dead  language  so  com- 
pletely as  to  be  able  to  write  or  speak  it  fairly,  and  Irish 
is  a  dead  language  to  those  who  have  not  spoken  it  from 
infancy.  Of  late  it  has  been  known  that  crowds  of  young 
people  are  studying  their  mother  tongue  very  hard,  and 
that  in  a  few  years  they  would  so  become  masters  of  it  that 
no  sham  could  live  with  them.  The  two  classes  of  would-be- 
scholars,  viz.,  those  who  speaking  Irish  have  but  a  slight 
acquaintance  with  its  grammar  or  literature,  and  who  are, 
on  the  whole,  uneducated  men,  and  those  who  never  spoke 
it,  and  consequently  never  spoke  its  idioms,  seeing  the 
danger  of  their  vocation  coming  to  an  end,  appear  to 
have  entered  into  a  solemn  league  and  covenant  to 
put  a  stop  to  the  study  of  correct  Irish,  and  espe- 
cially to  prevent  young  people  from  speaking  it  at 
an  early  age,  and  if  possible  to  kill  the  Gaelic  Journal, 
the  only  bar  to  the  corruption  of  the  language  in 
existence.  To  whisper  to  people  that  fishwomen  only 
speak  Irish  now ;  that  it  is  only  the  tongue  of  a  poor 
Connaughtman  ;  that  modern  Irish  is  no  help  to  a  know- 
ledge of  the  older  forms  of  the  language  ;  to  corrupt  text- 
books, catechisms,  the  inscriptions  on  the  tombs  of  our 
dead — such,  gentlemen,  are  the  means  employed,  especially 
by  those  who  would  ruin  the  Irish  tongue,  and  notably  by 
the  secretaries  of  your  Society.  That  the  books  published 
under  your  auspices  are  of  this  sort  no  Irish  scholar,  if  such 
there  be  amongst  your  working  members,  will  deny.  But 
so  few  know  anything  of  our  tongue  that  these  incorrect 
books  are  being  lauded  as  examples  of  what  such  pub- 
lications should  be,  of  course  by  persons  who  are  as 
ignorant  on  the  subject  as  those  they  address.  And  the 
misfortune  is  that  your  Society  is  put  forward  in  Ireland 
and  in  America  as  a  guarantee  that  your  corrupt  publica- 
tions are  excellent  in  every  respect,     Is  it  not  time,  gentle- 


men, that  you  should  put  a  stop  to  this  thing  ?  To  my 
own  knowledge  many  of  you  are  as  unselfish  lovers  of  the 
old  tongue  as  any  persons  living  ;  why  should  your  name 
and  money  be  traded  on '  or  the  destruction  of  that 
tongue  ? 

In  the  next  paper  below  (The  Fate  of  the  Children  of 
Tureannjyou  will  see  howyournamehasbeenusedto  adver- 
tise your  publications  in  two  respectable  journals  ;  and 
in  the  Shamrock  your  labours  in  the  cause  of  your 
country's  language  have  been  held  up  to  the  admi- 
ration of  its  readers.  Your  secretary,  Mr.  M 'Sweeney,  has 
been  cited  as  saying  that  when  you  have  had  some  more 
class-books  before  the  public  you  will  then  get  a  dictionary 
compiled.  Nineteen  centuries  ago  Cicero  could  not  under- 
stand how  one  humbug  could  look  another  in  the  face  with 
a  serious  countenance.  Had  he  been  now  alive  he  might 
hear  the  above  announcement  made  to  the  editor  of  the 
Shamrock  without  the  movement  of  a  risible  muscle.  The 
following  letter  of  Professor  Zimmer  ought  to  convince 
those  who  honestly  doubt  on  the  subject  that  the  modern 
Irish  is  necessary  for  understrnding  the  older  forms  of  the 
Celtic.  The  reader  will  observe  that  it  was  addressed  to 
your  secretary,  and  before  the  secession  of  the  founders  of 
your  Society  took  place.

"Dear  Sir — Ihave,in  connection  with  my  studies  of  the 
Aryan  languages,  devoted  some  years  to  the  study  of 
Celtic,  especially  to  Irish. 

"Although  it  is  the  more  ancient  period  of  this  language 
that  occupies  my  attention,  yet  having  determined  during 
this  summer  just  past  to  betake  myself,  for  the  advance- 
ment of  my  studies,  directly  to  the  place  where  the  sources 
of  the  language  of  this  period  most  abound,  and  to  spend 
my  holidays  in  discovering  some  of  the  treasures  which  lie 
buried  in  the  libraries  of  the  Royal  Irish  Academy,  Trinity 
College,  and  the  Franciscan  Convent,  I  doubted  not  for 
an  instant  that  I  should  to  a  certain  extent  succeed  in  ac- 
quiring a  knowledge  of  the  spoken  language  by  means  of 
ten  weeks'  intercourse  with  die  people.  I  was,  however, 
much  disappointed.  To  my  query,  '  An  labhran  tu 
Gaoidhilg,'  I  invariably  received  this  answer,  '  I  don't 
understand  you.'  I  spent  two  days  endeavouring  to  find 
an  Irishman  who  understood  his  mother  tongue. 

In  the  course  of  conversat;on  with  persons  here,  I  find 
there  is  a  notion  that  ancient  Irish  is  totally  different  from 
modem  Irish,  and,  therefore,  scholars  who  devote  them- 
selves to  the  old  Irish  deem  the  modern  unworthy  their 
consideration.  I  need  not  remark  how  erroneous  is  this 
notion.    The  more  I  studied  the  Irish  language  of  the

ancient  MSS. ,  the  more  indispensable  I  found  a  solid  know- 
ledge of  the  modern  Irish,  &c,  &c. 

"  Dr.  H.  Zimmer. 
"  M.  J.  J-  M'Sweeney,  &c,  &c." 

Now,  gentlemen  of  the  Society  for  the  Preservation  of 
the  Irish  Language,  I  ask  you  seriously  had  Dr.  Zimmer 
called  to-day  what  improvement  would  he  find  at  the 
meeting  of  your  Council  ?  Your  secretaries  know  as  much 
of  the  spoken  language  now  as  then.  A  rumour  has  been 
spread  that  Dr.  Zimmer  did  not  find  an  Irish  speaker  till 
he  met  your  secretary.  But  nobody  ever  held  up  the 
ignorance  of  your  secretary  as  completely  as  Dr.  Zimmer. 
Again,  would  Dr.  Zimmer  be  told  that  there  was  a  Gaelic 
Union.andthatat  its  meeting  he  would  find  Irish  speakers? 
Foreigners  call  to  the  Royal  Irish  Academy ;  are  they  told 
that  persons  could  be  found  to  speak  Irish  to  them?  They 
are  not,  nor  are  natives.  A  few  years  since,  a  Mr.  Maguire, 
who  had  some  interest  in  Father  Furlong's  Irish  Prayer 
Hook,  wanted  to  publish  a  new  edition  ol  it.  Not  know- 
ing Irish,  he  applied  to  your  Society  or  to  the  Academy. 
Persons  said  to  be  competent  were  recommended  to  him  by 
your  secretary.  The  work  was  committed  to  these  parties, 
and  three  small  parts  of  it  were  printed.  I  believe  beau- 
tiful new  type  was  cast  for  the  work.  The  numbers  were 
sent  to  the  Irish  scholars  through  the  country,  and  the  re- 
plies came  back  that  they  were  one  tissue  of  errors.  Some 
of  the  correspondents  asked  Mr.  Maguire  had  he  con- 
sulted me.  He  told  me  that  was  the  first  occasion  on  which 
he  had  heard  my  name.  I  found,  as  the  others  had, 
that  the  work  should  be  begun  again,  dt  novo;  and  so  it 
was  thrown  aside.

The  Fate  of  the  Children  of  Tuireann,  Edited  for  the 
Society  for  the  Preservation  of  the  Irish  Language,  by 
Richard  J.  O'Duffy,  Hon.  Sec. 

"'The  Fate  of  the  Children  of  Tuireann'  has  been 
edited  by  Mr.  Richard  J.  O'Duffy,  for  the  Society  for  the 
Preservation  of  the  Irish  Language.  To  say  that  it  is 
published  under  their  auspices,  is  to  say  that  it  is  excellent 
in  every  way.  Mr.  O'Duffy's  volume  contains  a  splendidly 
printed  text,  an  English  translation,  a  glossary,  and  copious 
notes,  with  a  typographical  and  biographical  appendix. 
Nothing  that  could  aid  the  student  is  omitted.  Mr. 
O'Duffy  has  every  reason  to  be  proud  of  his  work." 
Dublin  Nation,  2nd  June,  1SS8. 

"The  Society  for  the  Preservation  of  the  Irish  Language, 
Dublin,  has  recently  added  to  its  very  valuable  text-books 
another  entited  '  Oi-oe  ChUmme  €uipe<mii,  the  Fate  of 
the  Children  of  Tuireann,'  edited  by  Richard  J.  O'Duffy, 
Hon.  Secretary  to  the  Society.  Like  the  '  Pursuit  of 
Diarmuid  and  Grainne,'  the  'Children  of  Lir,'  and  the 
other  like  publications,  it  will  be  of  especial  value  and 
assistance  to  the  student  of  the  language,  because  of  its 
copious  notes,  complete  vocabulary,  and  elucidation  of 
many  idiomatic  phrases.  I  began  reading  it  the  other 
eveninr.  and  had  got  to  the  third  page  when  I  was  re- 
minded of  the  recent  discussion  between  Mr.  T.  O'N. 
Russell  and  Mr.  Fleming  anent  the  governing  power  of 
cum.  ...  I  suppose  Mr.  O'Duffy  knows  as  much 
about  the  Irish  language  as  does  any  of  Mr.  Russell's 
critics,"  &c,  &c.  Mr.  E.  P.  M'Dermot,  157  East  30th 
street,  New  York,  in  Irish-American,  14th  July,  18SS 
(six  weeks  afler  the  Dublin  article). 

When  his  visitor,  wearing  an  ■ögo.fò  JTtoiI,  tried  to  in- 


duce Sir  Dugald  Dalgetty  to  desert  to  the  Duke  of  Argyll, 
extolling  the  noble  spirit,  the  generous  heart,  and  the 
bountiful  hand  of  his  grace,  the  knight  replied  that  he  had 
never  heard  so  much  good  spoken  of  Argyll  before,  and 
seizing  his  visitor  by  the  throat,  he  added,  "  You  are  the 
Duke  of  Argyll."  I  could  almost  assert  that  no  man  living 
except  Mr.  R.J.  O'Duffy  would  write  the  jaunty  article  in  ihe 
Nation  of  2nd  June  last,  from  which  our  extract  is  taken. 
And  it  is  equally  certain  that  Mr.  O'Duffy  dictated  the  let- 
ter inserted  six  weeks  later  in  the  Irish- American.  Were 
Mr.  M'Dermott  the  writer  of  that  letter,  or  capable  of 
writing  it,  one  would  think  he  must  have  read  the  works 
which  he  praises  so  highly.  In  afew  pages  of  one  of  these 
works,  there  are,  as  has  been  shown  over  and  over  again, 
113  errors  :  puerile  errors  forwhich  a  boy  in  the  Fifth  Hook 
in  a  National  School  would  be  flogged.  These  errors  are  in 
black  and  white  before  the  world  under  the  hand  and  seal 
of  Mr.  R.  J.  O'Duffy.  Now,  how  is  it  for  a  moment  to  be 
supposed  that  Mr.  M'Dermott,  who  knows  somethingabout 
Lindley  Murray,  and  could  even  quote  a  rule  in  Dr. 
Joyce's  Irish  Grammar — how  is  it  to  be  supposed,  I  say, 
that  such  a  man  with  these  blunders  under  his  eyes,  would 
recommend  the  book  containing  them  ?  Mr.  M'Dermott . 
may  lie  a  real  personage,  but  he  did  not — he 
would  be  ashamed  to  hold  up  Mr.  O'Duffy  to  the  world 
as  a  scholar.  It  is  true  that  Mr.  Daniel  Lynch  of  Dunleer 
did,  over  his  name,  assert  that  he  had,  from  cover  to 
cover,  read  the  book,  the  Pursuit  of  Diarmuid  and 
Grainne,  Part  I.,  and  that  he  did  not  see  in  it  a  single 
syllable  he  would  wish  to  alter  ;  but  a  second  Daniel 
Lynch  could  not  be  found  ateither  side  of  the  Atlantic.  For 
instance,  a  most  zealous  member  of  the  Society  for  the 
Preservation  of  the  Irish  Language  sent  for  this  book  to 
review  it,  favourably  of  course,  as  far  as  prudence  would 
allow.  But  though  most  anxious  to  praise  the  work,  it  is 
so  very  bad  that  he  could  not  do  so,  having  a  character  to 
lose.  And  finding  that  he  had  nothing  good  to  say  of  the 
book,  he  said  nothing,  good,  bad,  or  indifferent  about  it.

cÁinedẅ,  and  in  this  way,  the  book,  with  its  113  blunders, 
is  still  in  the  hands  of  our  students.  But  the  most  con- 
vincing proof  of  all  as  to  the  nature  of  the  Pursuit  of  Diar- 
muid and  Grainne,  is  the  fact  that  the  corrections  made 
in  the  Gaelic  Journal  of  the  blunders  in  it,  have  been 
adopted  by  Mr.  O'Duffy  in  his  new  book.  In  this  new 
book  a  third  or  fourth  of  the  words  erroneously  classed  in 
the  Pursuit  are  found,  and  all  these  wordshave  been  corrected 
as  in  the  Gaelic  Journal,  except  one,  10115a,  a  nail,  whose 
gen.  is  said  in  the  new  book,  as  in  the  old,  to  be  like  the 
nom.,  whereas  it  is  10115411.  Of  this  new  work  of  Mr. 
O'Duffy's  we  cannot  speak  at  length  to-day  ;  there  are 
only  two  points  to  which  we  will  briefly  refer.  Mr. 
O'Duffy,  like  some  others,  has  had  for  years  a  crochet  on 
the  brain.  In  many  of  our  stories  the  expression  ap 
fdUMti-leip;:  &  ■ó)\otiiA  occurs,  descriptive  of  the  manner 
in  which  a  warrior  carries  his  shield  when  not  in  battle. 
Professor  O'Curry  translates  the  phrase  "  on  the  arch- 
slope  of  his  back;"  and  Mr.  O'Grady,  "on  the  broad  ex- 
pansive arch  of  his  back."  Dr.  O'Donovan  also  translates 
ptJUAJ;,  "an  arch."  These  three  writers,  if  we  except 
Mr.  \V.  M.  Hennessy,  were  the  best  all-round  Irish 
scholars  of  this  country  for  the  last  century,  and  yet,  where 
they  are  all  three  unanimous,  Mr.  R.  J.  O'Duffy  is  not 
afraid,  single-handed,  to  enter  the  lists  against  them,  as 
the  readers  will  see  in  the  extracts  below  from  the  "  Pur- 
suit of  Diarmuid  and  Grainne,"  published  four  years  since, 
and  from  the  "  Fate  of  the  Children  of  Tuireann,"  pub- 
lished the  other  day.  Our  readers  will  say  that  it  is  worse 
than  wasting  time  and  space  to  be  throwing  water  on  the

Hon.  Sec.  of  the  Society  for  the  Preservation  of  the  Irish 
Language ;  but  let  them  recollect  that  his  tomfoolery  is 
paid  for  by  the  Society,  and  published  with  the  impri- 
matur of the  Society  upon  it.  And  let  them  look  again 
at  the  laudation  of  this  stuff  in  the  two  extracts  taken  from 
two  respectable  papers  at  the  head  of  this  article.  But  this 
laudation  is  by  Mr.  O'Duffy  himself,  it  will  be  said.  Yes; 
but  not  a  reader  in  a  thousand  of  these  papers  will  ever 
know  that  the  articles  are  not  by  the  editor  of  the

Vocabulary  to  the  Pursuit  Vocabulary  to  the  Fate  of 
of  Diarmuid  and  Graimie,  the  Children  of  Tuireann, 
1884.  18SS. 


"  Souai  g-lein;:,  i.e.,  pro- 
bably an  inflected  form  of

plains, a  point,  a  pinnacle,

hence  r"ou<.vn!)-teii>5  a  x>\\o- 
m&,  may  denote  the  chief 
or  principal  armour  of  his 
(Lugh's)  back,  from  which 
his  shield  depended." 

In  the  note  to  the  Fate  of 
the  Children  of  Tuireann,  it 
is  said — "  Op  foiiAig  being 
A  -ononiA,  'over  the  pro- 
jected armour  of  his  back.' 
O'Brien's  and  O'Reilly's 
diets,  give  pcuAiẅ,  a  ridge, 
a  pinnacle.  It  is  probable 
that  rcuAiw-leipg,  means 
an  'armour-stud,'  i.e.,  a 
studor  projection  fixed  upon 
the  upper  part  of  the  back- 
piece  from  which  to  suspend 
the  shield." 


"  SouAigleipg,  armour

part  of  the  body,  and  being,

back-piece  of  his  armour  ;  as 
po  cuip  ApgiAc  AipfouAig- 
teipg  a  •opotiiA,  he  slung 
his  shield  upon  his  dorsal 
armour-plate." 


In  a  note  to  the  Pursuit 
we  read:  "S-ouAigisanarch, 
but  it  also  denotes  the  upper 
part  of  a  man  or  beast,  and 
in  connexion  with  teipg  is 
used  to  denote  the  upper 
armour  that  covered  the 
body  of  TJiApmuio.  The 
word  that  follows  pmiAig- 
leipg,  viz.,  a  •oponiA  [rate 
a  •ôponi  a]  particularizes  that 
it  was  the  dorsal  or  back- 
piece  of  his  armour  upon 
which  he  hung  his  shield." 


What  is  the  upper  part  of  a  man  or  beast  ?  The  upper 
part  of  a  man  is  the  head,  and  by  some  satirists  it  is  called 
rxuAi-o,  but  its  armour  is  cl05.ro,  or  helmet ;  but  all  this  is 
not  pertinent.  Worse  still  is  the  assertion  that  "  being  [is]  a 
phonetic  Munster  form  of  Unni  g,  dat.of  buineAè,  armour." 
"  tuipeac  "  is  not  the  word,  but  "  bui-peAc,"  and  its  dat. 
not  "  Uitnig,"  but  "tinpig."  In  the  body  of  the  tale, 
and  in  ever}'  place  where  it  is  spoken  of,  buipeAC  is  written 
with  ui  long  (lit  pron.,  nearly  00)  ;  in  the  vocabulary  in 
two  places  under  the  words  UnpeAC  and  pcuAi g-being, 
the  accent  has  been  omitted,  and  the  word  in  both  places 
is  written  UnpeAC.  The  editor,  Mr.  O'Duffy,  for  years  as 
has  been  said,  has  had  "dorsal-plate,"  "armour  stud," 
&c,  &c. ,  on  the  brain,  and  to  come  at  these  terms  it  was 
necessary  to  metamorphose  Uiinig  to  beipg.  For  this 
purpose,  first  of  all,  the  ui  had  to  be  shortened,  i.e.,  all 
authorities  falsified,  and  in  the  next  place  it  was  necessary 
to  say  that  this  was  effected  by  a  "phonetic  Munster" 
pronunciation.  Now  this  assertion  is  a  deliberate  falsifi- 
cation. No  Christian,  pagan,  or  man,  in  Munster,  or  any- 
where else,  ever  pronounced  UiipeAC  as  beipg  ;  the  two 
sounds  are  as  remote  as  "goose"  and  "get."  If  the 
reader  will  look  again  at  the  extracts  given  above,  he  will 
see  that  the  thing  is  so  managed  as  to  leave  the  impression 
that  it  was  O'Reilly  who  said  this.  And  by  the  way,  this 
is  one  of  Mr.  O'Duffy's  methods  ;  he  so  mixes  what  he 
wishes  to  be  understood  with  the  words  of  some  author  as 


to  make  people  believe  that  the  author  has  said  what  he 
himself  has  invented.  The  falsification  above  is  not  a  slip 
of  pen  or  memory,  it  was  done  on  purpose,  and  Mr. 
M'Dermott  can  scarcely  be  a  party  to  misleading  our  stu- 
dents by  superlative  lauda:ion  of  the  book,  and  the  author 
by  whom  our  texts  had  been  falsified. 

I  shall  take  the  earliest  possible  opportunity  of  pointing 
out  in  detail  theothererrorsin  the  "Fate  of  the  Children  oi 
Tuireann."  One  other  pent  only  I  will  touch  upon  at  pre- 
sent. It  is  the  artful  way  in  which  O'Curry,  O'Donovan, 
O'Grady,  and  our  other  scholars  are  found  iault  with  of 
late  fur  the  purpose  of  lessening  the  esteem  of  our  students 
for  these  men,  whose  authority  is  to  some'  extent  a  check 
upon  those  who  know  as  much  about  Iri-h  as  they  do 
about  Sanscrit.  In  the  extracts  from  the  Pursuit  of  Diar- 
muid and  Grainne,  and  from  the  Fate  of  the  Children  of 
Tuireann  given  above,  we  have  seen  how  the  editor  sets 
at  nought  our  best  men,  and  how  he  calls  in  O'Reilly  and 
O'Brien  to  his  aid,  though,  like  Mrs.  Malaprop,  he  had  to 
use  violence  towards  these  authorities  to  make  them  come 
at  his  call. 

Since  the  above  was  written  I  have  come  to  the  conclu- 
sion that  Mr.  M'Dermott  has  a  real  existence,  and  cer- 
tainly, if  so,  he  is  a  singular  character,  and  with  a  vanity 
of  his  own.  He  read  some  of  Lindley  Murray's  Grammar, 
and  this  little  he  contrives  to  let  out  as  artlessly  as  the  old 
gentleman  in  the  Vicar  of  Wakefield  talked  of  Manetho 
and  Berosus.  He  has  not  given  us  any  sample  of  his  own 
Irish  to  judge  ;  but  after  a  lapse  of  a  good  many  weeks  he 
repeats  what  the  Dublin  Nation  or  Mr.  Russell  had  said. 
He  imitates  Mr.  Russell  in  getting  a  dozen  men  in  buck- 
ram to  learn  a  certain  lesson,  "  cIiuato  p  cum  ah  pip  vo 
póyAÒ  ;  he  throws  to  the  winds  the  grammarians  of  this 
century,  on  finding  that  they  had  betrayed  Mr.  Russell, 
and  so  on.  But  his  logic  is  perfect.  "  When  doctors 
differ,"  he  says,  "  tyros  in  the  study  of  the  Irish  language 
may  elect  whom  to  follow  ;"  ergo,  O'Donovan,  O'Curry, 
O'Grady,  and  O'Duffy,  are  all  equal ;  but  if  there  be  any 
selection  at  all,  the  latter  is  worth  the  other  three. 
"  Students  in  every  science,"  he  adds,  "  have  not  unfre- 
quently  to  contend  with  errors  in  their  text  books  ;"  and 
the  conclusion  is,  logice_  Mr.  O'Duffy's  work,  with  its 
six  score  errors  in  a  few  paijes,  is  as  good  as  another. 
And  a  few  lines  lower  he  declares  that  one  example  cor- 
rectly done  was  preferable  to  a  large  number  not  so  cor- 
rect. All  this  was  in  the  July  letter.  Since  that  time  he 
has  further  followed  Mr.  Russell's  example,  and  betaken 
himself  to  counting  the  sentences  in  Irish  books  in  which 
cum  is  luund  followed  by  a  gen.  before  an  infinitive.  These 
he  has  given  the  public  in  a  second  letter  in  the  Irish- 
American  of  October  13.  In  Nielson's  Grammar,  too,  he 
has  found  that  "  cum,  for  the  purpose  of,  is  commonly 
used  before  the  infinitive  ;"  and  though  he  had  thrown 
the  grammarians  of  the  century,  including  O'Donovan,  to 
the  winds,  he  has  picked  up  this.  Having  so  much  lei- 
sure at  his  disposal  perhaps  he  will,  look  through  authori- 
ties parallel  to  some  passages  from  Mr.  Russell's  address 
on  CATJg  jjaoIac,  which  I  give  in  this  issue.  In  .Mr. 
Duffy's  last  book  which  Mr.  M'Dermott  is  sponsor  for,  it 
is  said,  note  79,  p.  150,  that  Goliath  "had  a  target  of 
brass  between  his  shoulders.  <lgup  goippéATj  ppÁir 
ei-oin  A  jjuAillili,"  and  '.his  is  said  to  illustrate  how  the 
Irish  warrior  slung  his  shield  upon  his  "dorsal  armour- 
plate  :"  will  Mr.  M'Dermott  explain  this,  always  bearing 
in  mind  that  a  target  is  a  small  shield,  and  that  a  youth 
carried  the  giant's  shield  before  him.  Mr.  M'Dermott 
would  also  show  scholarship  by  explaining  what  phonetic 
peculiarities  were  in  Munster  when  the  old  tales  were  writ- 
ten in  which  pcuAi-rj-leip5  a  •oponiA  is  found,— Ed.  CJ. 


THE    GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


To  the  Editor  of  the  Gaelic  Journal. 

Dear  Sir — I  am  very  sorry  to  see  any  occasion  for  dis- 
sension between  a  veteran  and  Irish  scholar  like  yourself 
and  a  man  so  enthusiastic  for  Irish  as  is  Mr.  O  Neill  Rus- 
sell. I  think  you  both  use  unnecessarily  strong  language, 
and  that  in  the  interests  of  our  native  tongue,  the  contro- 
versy on  the  government  of  cum  should  cease  after  this 
number.  It  has  been  well  thrashed  out  on  both  sides,  and, 
in  my  opinion,  settled,  mi  Aip  bvóeAiin  ah  cahic  am 
pubil  1)-  bum  beul  iaüca. 

On  the  other  hand  I  cannot  but  approve  of  your  expo- 
sure, by  instructive  reviews  and  corrections  of  incorrect 
and  misleading  class-books,  of  the  pretensions  of  those 
who,  as  you  say,  are  corrupting  the  language.  Leaving 
out  of  consideration  the  open  enemies  of  the  native  tongue, 
of  whom  there  are  enough  in  all  conscience,  there  are 
numbers  of  persons  who  are  secretly  and,  in  some  cases, 
unconsciously  its  enemies.  These  may  be  divided  into 
two  classes— 1st.  ignorant  persons  who,  because  they  can 
speak  some  Irish,  and  perhaps  in  a  kind  of  way  can 
read  a  sentence  in  a  Gaelic  book,  imagine  they  are  Irish 
scholars,  though  without  a  knowledge  of  the  grammar  or 
literature  of  the  language,  and  through  vanity  rush  into 
print,  and  make  themselves  and  the  language  ridiculous. 
The  second  class  is  composed  of  more  dangerous,  because 
more  malicious  enemies,  viz..  of  persons  who  never  had  a 
colloquial  knowledge  of  Irish,  but,  having  acquired  a 
smattering  of  it  from  books,  through  vanity  combined  with 
the  sordid  desire  of  pecuniary  gain,  pose  before  those  who 
are  ignorant  of  the  language  as  Irish  scholars.  We  have 
examples  of  such  among  members  of  the  so-called  Society 
for  the  Preservation  of  the  Irish  Language,  and  you  de- 
served well  of  Gaelic  students  in  reviewing  some  of  their 
handiwork  in  late  numbers  of  the  Journal.  It  would  be 
well  if  you  continued  such  criticism  as  the  review  of  the 
first  part  of  the  CopmgeAcc  in  the  next  number. 

I  am,  however,  informed  that  you  intend  in  this  number 
to  i  rint  a  remonstrance  addressed  to  "  The  Society  for  the 
Preservation  of  the  Irish  Language."  I  do  not  consider 
this  course  either  expedient  or  useful.  Although  that 
Society,  by  its  obstruction  of  the  bonajidt  work  of  the 
Gaelic  Union,  by  its  publishing  at  long  intervals  two  or 
three  incorrect  Gaelic  books,  and  in  other  ways,  has  in- 
jured the  cause  it  professes  to  maintain,  yet  the  question 
arises,  would  remonstrating  with  it  be  of  any  practical 
benefit  to  that  cause  ?  We  must  remember  that  the  great 
majority  of  its  members  are  really  honest,  well-intentioned 
men,  «  ho.  because  they  belong  to  and  support  the  Society, 
are  inclined  to  believe  that  all  its  acts  are  right  and  good, 
and  who  resent  being  told  that  they  are  supporting  a  hum- 
bug, however  true  the  statement  may  be.  Nothavingany 
knowledge  of  the  Irish  language,  they  cannot  judge  of  the 
merits  of  the  question  at  issue,  and  are  naturally  trustful 
of  those  who  direct  the  affairs  of  their  own  Society.  It  is 
no  use  trying  to  convert  such  people  as  these  ;  they  will 
only  be  rendered  more  obstinate  by  remonstrance.  It  is  a 
pity  to  occupy  the  valuable  space  of  the  Gallic  Journal  by 
addresses  to  a  Society  which,  after  all,  has  been  of  little 
importance  since  the  secession  of  its  founders  and  Irish 
scholars.  The  general  public  are  eitherhostile  to  orentirely 
indifferent  to  the  Irish  language,  and  the  best  we  can  do 
ai  present  is  to  preserve  as  much  of  it  as  we  can  till  such 
time  as  the  Irish  nation  shall  awake  to  the  importance  of 
the  native  tongue.  Let  the  Gaelic  Union  do  its  own  use- 
ful work,  as  it  has  hitherto  done,  disregarding  covert  or 
open  attacks  on  the  language  from  outside. 

Ill  health  ami  the  pressure  of  much  work  have  prevented 
my  furnishing  you  up  to  this  with  the  continuation  ol  Sgeul 
mhtc  ah  bhpAUÁm  and  other  matter,  but  I  hope  to  have 


it  ready  for  the  next  number  of  the  Gaelic  Journal.  I 
have  heard  that  the  enemies  of  the  Gaelic  Union  have  been 
industriously  spreading  the  report  of  the  extinction  of  the 
Journal.  I  trust  the  only  Gaelic  periodical  in  Ireland  will 
live  for  many  a  year  yet  under  your  able  editorship,  to  ex- 
pose shams  and  confound  the  enemies  of  the  native  tongue. 
Every  Irishman  who  cares  about  his  native  language  should 
come  forward  and  help  to  support  the  Gaelic  Union,  what- 
ever his  negligence  may  have  hitherto  been  in  this  respect, 
as  it  is  the  only  Society  able  or  willing  to  do  any  really 
good  work  for  the  language. 

When  I  was  last  in  Hup  ttleoẂAin  ŵpAii,  I  took  down 
the  native  names  of  the  inlets,  rocks,  and  other  prominent 
natural  features  round  the  coast  of  that  island,  beginning 
at  the  long  expanse  of  strand  and  proceeding  to  the  west, 
and  so  on  round,  till  we  came  to  the  strand  again.  They 
are  as  follow — CpÁg  leicpeAè,  bun  ha  cruiaj,  caIa  plieA-

These  names  may  be  useful  for  some  future  geographer  or 
antiquary  when  Gaelic  names  excite  more  interest  than 
they  do  at  present.  I  took  them  down  just  as  they  were 
pronounced  by  the  fishermen,  without  presuming  to  correct 
them.  In  conclusion  I  wish  success  to  the  Gaelic  Union 
in  its  struggle  for  existence,  and  to  its  organ,  the  Gaelic 
Journal;  but  I  would  say  with  Eliphaz,  ẃp  cóip  •oo'óuiiie

Note. — Of  all  the  friends  who  have  remonstrated  with 
me  for  the  Russell  controversy,  there  is  not  one  that  would 
enter  upon  that  controversy  with  raore  reluctance  than  I 
did.  The  strongest  proof  of  this  I  can  give  is  that  I  wrote  a 
letter  to  send  to  theîrtsÄ-Amerícanon  reading Mr.Russell's 
strictures  on  Cat);;  JaoIac  two  years  ago  ;  but  I  did  not 
send  the  letter.  Again,  in  December,  1S77,  when  I 
passed  through  Dublin,  on  my  way  to  the  Seven  Churches, 
I  called  to  Father  Nolan,  whom  I  then  saw  for  the  first 
time,  with  the  letter  mentioned  in  another  place  in  this 
issue  of  the  Journal.  The  only  persons  I  made  inquiries 
about  were  Mr.  Comyn  and  Mr.  O'Neill  Russell.  The 
former  was  out  of  town  and  the  latter  in  Kingstown  ;  and 
could  1  at  all  manage  it,  I  would  have  called  to  Kings- 
town to  see  him.  Nor  would  any  ordinary  cause  induce 
me  to  speak  of  him  in  bitterness.  But  at  the  eleventh 
hour,  alter  having  literally  given  years  of  my  life  in  en- 
deavouring to  keep  the  old  tongue  alive  until  our  people 
would  come  to  value  it  as  a  precious  inheritance,  it  was 
too  much  to  see  Mr.  Russell  putting  weapons  for  its  ex- 
tinction into  the  hands  of  the  worst  enemy  the  language 
has  had  for  a  century.  The  controversy  in  respect  of 
cum  is  at  an  end,  if  I  can  help  it.  When  the  Short 
Catechism  was  published  I  was  resolved  to  have  a  word- 
for-word  translation  of  it  in  the  hands  of  learners  in  a 


THE   GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


IOI 


few  months.  By  a  most  flagrant  piece  of  library  treachery 
the  Catechism,  in  the  first  instance,  was  rendered  a 
laughing-stock,  and  next  the  corruptions  in  it  were  de- 
fended by  their  author  writing  under  a  mask.  To  show 
what  these  corruptions  really  were,  I  had  to  spend  in  re- 
plying to  the  author  of  them  the  time  in  which  I  would 
have  made  the  Hamiltonian  translation  of  the  Catechism. 
A  moiety  of  the  space  of  the  Journal  had  for  years  to  be 
given  to  the  correction  of  the  errors  committed  by  so 
many  of  our  authors  ;  even  those  of  the  highest  standing 
amongst  us.  Nor  can  this  task  be  yet  given  over.  But 
nothing  in  future  shall  interfere  with  our  devoting  a  good 
share  of  our  space  to  the  instruction  of  our  young  students. 
I  cannot  at  all  agree  with  our  correspondent  as  regards 
the  members  of  the  S.P.I.L.  The  majority  of  them  will 
be  undeceived,  and  then  they  will  take  the  proper 
action. — E.  G.J.

VOCABULARY  NOTES,  &c. 

The  composer  of  the  elegy  given  above,  IYIái  petit 
Uhonogain,  was  famous  as  a  bean-caomce  in  her  day ; 
but  if  her  compositions  were  ever  put  on  paper,  very  few 
of  them  have  come  down  to  us.     The  MS.  from  which  this 
caouiearj  was  copied  w'as  very  imperfect,  but  I  never  had 
any  opportunity  of  correcting  it,  and  I  give  it  now  in  the 
hopes  that  some  of  our  readers  will  send  me  a  loan  of  any 
of  her  compositions  they  possess,  or  make  a  copy  of  them 
for  publication  in  the  Journal.     From  others  of  her  com- 
positions, it  can  be  inferred  that  her  brothers  and  sisters 
were  very  numerous  and  highly  respectable  ;  but  that  they 
had  fallen  very  low  during  her  lifetime.     I  cannot  exactly 
say  when  she  lived  ;  I  should  think  about  150  years  ago. 
Ueapbpácaip,  a  brother,  gen.,  -cap ;   voc.    as   nom., 
except    that     initial    is    aspirated,    a    ■oeapbpa-

tion for  pmne  or  pijtie,  past  tense  of  •oéanami,   I 
do ;    •oo   ceabg    an    cponiie    agam,    that    stung 
(wounded  my  heart)  ;  an  cpoirje,   the  heart  with 
(within)  me  is  more  emphatic   than  mo  cponie. 
SoU,armnn,gen.,  -bamna,  a  feast ;  oiptjeapc,  chief,

PECULIAR  LOCALISMS. 

By  Rev.  D.  B.  Mulcahy,  P.P.,  M.R.I.A. 

Words  in  every-day  use  in  Dalriada,  North  Antrim, 
sometimes  called  the  Route,  Rowte,  Rutach,  &c. : —  _ 

Speel. — When  you  want  to  climb  or  creep  up  anything, 
it  is,  he  is  not  able  to  speel  that  tree,  but  I  can.  They 
are  speeling  the  brae  ;  that  is,  creeping  up  the  height  or 
hill. 

Brae. — Pronounced  bray,  bpé— means  a  hill,  a  head- 
land, according  to  O'Reilly's  Diet.,  but  the  old  Irish  form 
is  bpi.  I  heard  a  teacher  (not  the  present)  of  Carachrun 
N.  S.,  telling  a  boy  who  was  working  a  sum  in  addition 
on  the  blackboard,  to  add  them— the  figures— up  the  brae 
and  down  the  brae.  No  doubt  the  latter  was  meant  to 
prove  the  work. 

Scaling.— Means  dispersing,  dividing,  spreading,  as  m. 
When  I  was  passing  the  scholars  were  sealing  ;  the  people 
were  scaling  from  the  meeting  ;  that  is,  were  going  away, 
dispersing.  What  kept  Rose  from  school  yesterday  ?  She 
was  sealing  seaweed  or  dung,  as  the  case  may  be. 

Cog°eldy,  or  Coggledy. — When  anything  is  unsteady, 
it  is  said  to  be  coggeldy  ;  that  is,  hither  and  thither,  or 
up  and  down.  It  wants  a  cog  to  be  put  to  it.  A  plank 
or  pole  across  a  fulcrum  with  boys  at  each  end  rising  up 
and  down — "weigh  the  buckety  and  sell  the  salt" — 
is  here  called  Coggle  dey  curry,  and  by  others  Coppull  de 
curry,  but  evidently  from  the  Gaelic. 

Sue'  sue.— Sough.  The  c  (c  dotted)  is  pronounced  as  in 
Gaelic.  It  means  a  rumour,  a  whizzing  noise,  as,  did  you 
hear  the  soc  that  is  gaing  (going)  now  ?  It  was  like  the 
sough  of  the  wind.  O'Reilly's  Diet,  gives  Sucad,  suction, 
evaporation,  a  wave.  SucÁn,  a  sucker,  soaker.  Knock- 
soughy,  beside  Ballintoy,  is  said  to  derive  the  latter  part 
of  the  name  from  the  peculiar  suckage  of  the  waves 
beneath  the  hill  near  the  Brockey  "  Sq.  sett"  works. 

Wait,  writ. — This  is  the  name  given  to  what  is  called 
the  dildurn  or  boÚApÁn  in  the  Co.  Waterford.  It  is  a 
circular  wooden  hoop,  covered  over  with  calf  or  sheep 
skin,  and  can  be  played  like  a  tambourine  sometimes. 
The  player,  if  nimble  with  the  fingers  and  elbow,  can  show 
off. 

Slunks. — There  are  as  many  slunks — said  a  man  to  me 
one  day  as  he  was  driving  me  on  his  side-car  m.  in  this 
road,  as  would  cope  a  cart.  He  meant  ruts.  It  is  evi- 
dently derived  from  slink. 

Cope. — Means  to  overset,  overturn,  overbalance,  upset. 
"  He  coped  the  creels,"  is  a  common  expression  for  a 
complete  upset.  Cope  the  cart,  that  is,  throw  it  back  on 
the  trams  or  heels.  When  putting  manure  out  on  drills 
or  ridges,  it  is  said  to  boy,  make  four  or  five  or  six,  &c, 
coups  of  every  load,  which  means  a  heap  of  every  cope  of 
the  cart. 

Monaclyart When  one  feels  itchy  in  any  part  of  the 

body,  it  is  said  ÊÁ  monaclyart  orm,  and  it  is  interpreted 
to  mean  that  a  friend  is  speaking  of  the  person  who  feels 
the  itching.     It  is  Irish  ;  and  I  heard  it  in  Glenbuish. 


THE   GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


107 


Dullup'd.—  You  are  completely  dulluped,  that  is,  com- 
pletely done  up,  or  beaten.  This  is  rather  a  Co.  Down 
word. 

«.\01pe15au. — Meaning  after  to-morrow.  I  found  this 
word  in  an  old  MS.,  but  am  unable  to  trace  it  in  dic- 
tionaries. 

Ek  or  ik. — It  was  hard  to  get  on  the  ek  of  drawing  that 
tea.  That  is,  hard  to  get  on  the  knack  of  it,  or  anything 
else. 

Dolly. — Why  aren't  the  wains  at  school  ?  O,  your 
reverence,  they  haven't  a  dolly  to  put  on  them  ;  meaning, 
they  have  not  a  titter,  a  rag  to  cover  them. 

Droic. — When  une  is  stunted  in  growth,  they  say,  she 
is  only  a  droic ;  he  is  just  a  droic.  I  found  this  word  in 
O'Reilly's  Irish  Dictionary,  where  it  means  a  d'Marf.  One 
of  the  meanings  of  droc  in  same  work  is  little.  The  c 
(c  dot)  is  pronounced. 

Farrell. — A  farrell  of  bread  means  the  quarter  of  a  cake 
when  it  is  cut  in  four  quarters.  A  maid  said  she  could 
cut  a  three  farrell  cake,  that  is,  into  three  equal  parts. 
Cut  the  cake  into  farrells,  for  it  is  easier  turned. 

Booh. — Where  are  the  bouls  ?  Get  me  the  bools.  This 
word  means  the  pothangers  or  the  pothooks,  and  is  well 
known  in  Co.  Down  also.  I  found  it  in  O'Reilly's  Irish 
Dictionary  as  bucal,  a  pothook,  and  butap,  a  pothook. 

Keymll — Accent  on  first  syllable.  Casting  keyvills 
means  drawing  lots.  Keyvill  the  hay,  that  is,  toss  it 
through  other.  Keyvill  the  cards,  that  is,  put  them 
through  other,  or  mix  them.  This  word  is  well  known 
in  the  Co.  Down  also. 

Ginnling. — G  hard  in  both  cases.  I  was  ginnling 
trout,  salmon,  &c,  that  is,  I  was  seizing  them  with  a  great 
effort  and  throwing  them  in  on  the  bank.  In  fact  it  is 
much  the  same  as  guzzling.  They  were  ginnling  each 
other.     Same  in  Co.  Down. 


ÜAÛg  5Ẃ0'Ó^AC. 


Of  Timothy  Sullivan,  called  JaoTJlac  (the  Irish,  or  the 
Catholic),  we  know  next  to  nothing  until  he  was  far 
advanced  in  life.  He  was  a  native  of  West  Cork,  or  of 
the  adjoining  portion  of  Kerry,  but  that  is  all  we  can  say 
about  him.  In  all  probability  he  was  a  schoolmaster, 
like  his  name-ake  eojjan  flua-ò.  A  girl  one  day,  carry- 
ing dinner  to  some  workmen,  passed  him  by  on  the  road, 
and  she  photographed  him,  as  he  appeared  in  his  middle 
age:  " Cawj  Jaolaè,  buiŵe,  niéiup^peac,  geAnna, 
gtonncac,  yellow,  sunburnt;  geanna  =  5eánp,  short; 
gionucac,  pug-nosed.  This  must  have  been  while  he  was 
a  worldling ;  his  reply  shows  this  :  "  A  pepompe  cattle, 
pan  am  aice,  50  n-Tjéanpao  nann  tunc."  "  Cá  T>mnéan 
114  b-peap  aip  mo  riium  a'p  bpeapp  bioin  bpealX  ope," 
was  her  rejoinder.  Had  he  been  known  as  a  penitent 
no  one  would  thus  attack  him.  Sean-tunne  beag  -oub, 
c|\om,  was  my  father's  description  of  him  at  a  later  period. 
He  visited  the  northern  portion  of  the  county  of  Waterford, 
before  he  had  entered  on  his  career  of  penance.  From 
time  immemorial  it  was  usual  with  the  people  of  West 
Cork  and  Kerry  to  come  to  Waterford  in  hundreds  at  the 
potato  digging  and  harvest  seasons,  as  the  natives  of  the 
west  of  Ireland  now  go  to  England.  Adjoining  the  city 
of  Waterford  there   is  a  parish   called  Ballygunner,   or 


tells  the  world  that  he  was  a  bad  man,  a  drunkard,  &c. ; 
and  drunkards   are  bad   fathers  :   hence  the  son  did  not 
receive   Carjg   into  his  house.     To  spite  the  son  Caẅg 
stood  outside  the  gate  of  the  chapel  yard  on  Sunday,  and 
kept  repeating  for  the  congregation  :  nupe  Caẅg  Jaolac 
<\caip  OliiurvrimiTj.  Whether  he  remained  in  the  county  of 
Waterford   from  that  time  henceforth  we  do  not  know  ; 
but  we  find  traces  of  him  there  immediately  after  he  had 
begun  his  life  of  penance.     A  considerable  portion  of  his 
later  years   was  passed  in  my  native  parish  (Mothel  or 
Clonea),  and   in  the  parishes  adjoining  it.     It  was  the 
general  opinion  that  he  was  illiterate,  and  that  to  this  cir- 
cumstance he  owed  the  epithet  Jaolac  ;  but  such  was  not 
the  fact.     He  and  the  author  of  the  "  Fair  Hills  of  Erin  " 
met,  on  one  occasion,   at   the  house  of  James  Casey,  of 
111óin    rmonam,  a  townland   in   this  parish   of  Mothel. 
■OoiincjTJ  was  employed  at  the  time  transcribing  an  Irish 
MS.  for  a  neighbourning  priest.     Cawgtook  the  transcript 
in  his  hand   and  remarked  that  the  clergyman  would  not 
be  able  to  read   it  on  account  of  the  contractions  in  it. 
Had  he  not  been  a  scholar,  he  could  not  know  that  there 
were  contractions  in  the  MS.     The  Rev.  Michael  Casey, 
P.P.  of  Kilrosanty  and   Fews,  in  Waterford,  can  confirm 
the  truth  of  this  anecdote,  as  the  meeting  of  the  poets  took 
place  at  his  father's  house.     On  another  occasion,  calling 
at  the  house  of  Father  Mathias  Power,  P.P.,  of  the  neigh- 
bouring parish  of  Portlaw,  to  whom  he  was  unknown,  he 
announced  his  errand  as  coming  for  any  articles  of  left-off 
clothes  that  his  reverence  could  spare.     The  priest  replied 
that  he  had  so  many  visitors  on  similar  errands,  that  he 
had  no  spare  clothes  just  then.     They  talked  on  for  a  time, 
and  the  priest  enquired  what  was  his  name,  &c.     "  üaẅg  ó 
Suiliobáin  no  tug  an  paganc  opm,  ace  Ca-ôg  gaolaô 
T  ™ó  glaowaiT)  na  rjaome  opm,"  said  Sullivan.       "  Sé 
•00  beaca  aguprjo  fUmce.a  ühan5g,"rejoined  the  priest; 
and  he  added,  "111  aria  (tlluna)  b-puib  éarjac  agamn  cá 
aipgioo  agamn  xmic."     "  1p  niaic  an  geall  le  h-éa-oac 
aingiou  aon  am,"  said  Sullivan.     The  priest  invited  him 
to  stop  at  his  house  for  some  time,  and  both  walked  out. 
Not  far  from  the  house  was  a  plot  of  barley,  on  which  a 
number  of  sparrows  were  feasting.  "  <J  dialog,  pie,  agup 
pógaip  aip  11a  gealbam  úx>,"  said  his  companion.       Sul- 
livan, who  had  not  forgotten  the   ungracious  reception 
given  him  at   first,  replied  :  "nac  éacuac  an   pgeal  no 
rheana  glileanviip,   ceacc  50   paoriac   ag  aoijaipeacc 
gealban."     That  part  of  Waterford  is   called  paonac  or 
Power's  country  ;  and  by  méana  gleanúip  he  meant  that 
he  was  president  or  mayor  of  the  Bardic  Sessions  that  had 
been  held  in  Glanworth,  in  the  county  of  Cork.     It  may 
be  worth  mentioning  that  in  the  same  parish  of  Mothel  a 
bean-cige,  whom  I  remember  well,  asked  Sullivan,  "<\ 
Chaiijg,  50  né  an  cúir  üa-òg  gaolaè  tjo  cabaipe  ope?" 
"  man  ná  paib  mé  gall-Da   'piarii,  a  bean  á  cige,"  was 
the  reply. 

Though  mostly  residing  in  Waterford,  Caróg  paid 
occasional  visits  to  the  neighbouring  counties  of  Cork, 
Tipperary,  and  Kilkenny.  He  was  a  welcome  guest  at 
the  house  of  any  priest  or  farmer  he  chose  to  visit,  and  he 
was  free  to  remain  as  long  as  he  wished.  A  room  was 
given  to  him,  in  which  he  passed  nearly  all  his  time  pray- 
ing and  composing  the  poems  called  the  "  Pious  Mis- 
cellany." Being  very  old  at  the  time  of  their  composition, 
he  never  wrote  any  of  these  poems  ;  nor  were  they  taken 
down  from  his  dictation.     They  were  learned  by  rote,  and 


Cnoc  binẅe,  and  in  this  parish  many  of  these  workmen 

from  Bear  and  Bantry  became  settlers.  Among  these  I  afterwards  committed  to  paper,  either  by  Father  Mathias 
settlers  it  would  appear  there  was  a  son  of  Caẅg  Jaobac  Morrissey,  P.P.  of  Kill  and  Newtown,  or  by  Father  Pierse 
named  Oiapmuio  ;  and  the  father  having  heard  that  his  Power,  P.P.  of  Ballybricken,  all  in  the  diocese  of  Water- 
son  was  comfortable,  came  to  visit  him.     Cawg  himself  I  ford.     Father  Power,  I  believe,  got  the  first  edition  of  the

THE   GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


"  Pious  Miscellany "  printed  in  Clonmel,  and  this  first 
edition,  I  suspect,  was  the  most  correct  one  ever  printed— 
each  succeeding  edition  containing  all  the  errors  in  the 
former  editions,  and,  of  course,  some  new  ones.  The 
"  Pious  Miscellany"  was  composed  in  the  Munster  dialect, 
and  the  author  was  as  fully  justified  in  so  composing  it,  as 
Robert  Bums  was  in  employing  the  Scotch  dialect  of  the 
Lowlands.  The  verbs  "x>o  üaUaj;,  bo  caoca;;,  T>o 
Tnealla;;,"  are  as  legitimate  as  "  Scots  wha  haewí  Wal- 
lace bled,"  or  as  the  two  provincialisms  introduced  by 
Homer  into  the  first  line  of  the  Iliad.  John  of  Tuam,  too, 
in  a  solemn  translation  wrote  :  "  SAop  me  jvonh  me  •ôul 
Ann  bealAig,"  and  Ann  is  a  provincialism  pure  and 
simple.  In  one  word,  there  is  not  an  Irish  book  or  poem 
of  the  last  century  without  provincialisms.  For  instance, 
no  Munster  composition  is  without  ciigAin,  &c,  and  this 
in  the  west  or  north  of  Ireland  is  written  and  pronounced 
cujahi,  &c.  Nor  is  it  a  fact  that  an  Irish  scholar  from 
any  part  of  Ireland  finds  much  difficulty  in  understanding 
the  Pious  Miscellany.  Of  such  words  as  those  complained 
of  by  Mr.  Russell,  Dr.  O'Donovan  says,  Ir.  Gr.  p.  49  : 
"In  the  past  tense  of  the  indicative  pass.,  A-ò  is  pro- 
nounced A5  in  the  counties  of  Kilkenny,  Tipperary, 
Waterford,  and  parts  of  Limerick."  And  indeed  the  Irish 
scholar  should  be  a  poor  one  that  could  not  find  out  what 
part  of  the  verbs  "  t>o  -oaLIaj,  t>o  caoca^,  t>o  meAllAj;" 
were.  To  my  own  knowledge  scholars  from  the  west  of 
Ireland  do  read  and  enjoy  the  poems  of  Ca-òj;  JaoIac. 

With  the  exception  of  the  Irish  Catechism  the  Pious 
Miscellany  was  my  first  text-book  in  Irish.  I  learned  to 
read  it  without  any  great  difficulty  in  my  tenth  year — 64 
years  ago — and  before  many  months  I  was  able  to  read  it 
for  my  neighbours.  To  hear  these  poems  and  their  author 
reviled  by  Mr.  Russell,  pained  me,  as  if  it  were  one  of 
the  dear  friends  I  have  lost,  to  whom  the  remarks  of  Mr. 
Russell  were  applied.  Nor  was  I  the  only  person  pained 
by  his  remarks.  Timothy  Sullivan  was  waked  in  the  "  Big 
Chapel"  of  Waterford,  either  on  the  Christmas  Eve  or  the 
last  night  of  1799,  and  interred  next  day  at  Ballylaneen, 
midway  between  Kilmacthomas  and  Bonmahon.  In  the 
adjoining  parish  of  Newtown  lie  the  mortal  remains  of 
his  friend  OonncAÍi  TtuAW  ;  no  monument  pointing  out  to 
the  wayfarer  where  either  of  these  gifted  men  await  the 
last  trumpet  call.  I  did  one  time  expect  to  leave  my 
countrymen  an  edition  of  the  "  Pious  Miscellany,"  as  cor- 
rect as  I  could  make  it.  But  the  desertion  and  lukewarm- 
ness  of  friends,  more  than  even  the  thwarting  of  the 
enemies  of  the  Irish  language,  have  rendered  it  impossible 
for  me  to  do  this,  or  any  of  the  other  things  I  would  have 
done.  But,  unless  the  language  dies  very  soon,  some  per- 
se.n,  it  is  to  be  hoped,  will  bring  out  such  an  edition,  and 
it  will  be  doing  a  good  work  for  religion  and  for  the  Irish 
language.  I  now  give  the  portion  of  Mr.  Russell's  address 
that  has  reference  to  CAẄ5  JaoIac — on  the  language  of 
the  address  our  readers  will  form  their  own  judgment. 
I  have  only  to  repeat  what  I  said  in  No.  2S,  that  Caẅj 
was  esteemed  as  a  poet  of  a  high  order,  the  idol  in  Mun- 
ster of  learned  and  unlearned  alike  ;  but  that  his  poems 
have  been  so  completely  spoiled  by  the  printers,  that  they 
are  in  many  passages  difficult  to  be  understood. 

"  The  following  address  was  delivered  on  Sunday  even- 
ing, December  5,  nearly  two  years  since,  by  T.  O'Neill 
Russell,  in  the  parlours  of  the  Gaelic  Society.  The  rooms 
were  well  filled,  and  the  audience  manifested  considerable 
interest  in  what  the  speakers  said— Mr.  Butler.  Mr.Plunket 
and  Mr.  Flaherty  translating  into  English  the  gist  of  it, 
after  Mr.  Russell  had  finished  speaking."

This  extract  is  the  portion  of  Mr.  Russell's  address  that 
refers  to  Ca-ôj  JaoIac,  and  we  invite  our  readers,  as  an 
exercise,  to  give  us  theiropinion  upon  the  several  passages 
in  it.  We  would  also  request  the  special  attention  of  Mr. 
Russell  to  the  points  marked  out  below  ;  and  also  the  at- 
tention of  Mr.  M'Dermott,  if  he  be  a  real  personage. 
This  address  should  induce  our  students  to  speak  Irish  in 
season  and  out  of  season.  Mr.  Russell  is  a  scholar  of 
over  twenty  years'  standing ;  he  spoke  the  above  to  an

audience,  having  previously  written  it  out ;  he  again  cor- 
rected it  for  the  press,  and  after  all  you  see  it  is  not  Irish. 
But  why  is  it  so  bad?  Mr.  Russell's  education  was 
neglected.  He  has  to  think  out  his  addresses,  letters,  &c, 
in  English  ;  then  to  clothe  these  thoughts  in  a  second-hand 
Irish  dress,  i.e.,  Irish  words  of  some  kind  without  Irish 
ideas  or  Irish  idioms.  All  who  do  this  of  course  go  wrong 
whenever  they  depend  on  themselves.  They  spell  badly,  as 
in  LAb<Mpe,yô,  LAb\AipeAnn,  rjeACAp,  ÚAóg,  bA^Am  ;  and 
they  violate  grammar,  as  in  tieApnitii'o  mop,  u'a  cpAÒ- 
r«vmi,  11A01  pocAib,  upeAp  iiAb-pocAb.  But  why  publish 
such,  it  may  be  asked  ?  Mr,  Russell  does  not  know  it  is 
bad.  Like  Mr.  O'Duffy,  he  believes  it  as  good  as  it  could 
be  wished.  The  rest  of  the  address  will  be  given  in  the 
next  Journal,  if  we  can  at  all,  i.e.,  as  an  exercise.  As 
usual,  Mr.  Russell  invites  corrections  in  it.  The  reader 
will  take  notice  that  there  is  not  a  single  misprint  in  the 
extract.

METRICAL    VERSION    OF    U011K\S 
HUGO'S  LETTER. 

[From  the  Gaodhal  of  Brooklyn.] 

When  UomÁf  Uuaù  had  written  his  letter 
to  the  Paouac,  G.J.,  No.  30,  p.  87,  he  made 
the  following  metrical  version  of  it.  This 
version  our  tyros  had  better  get  by  heart, 
for  the  sake  of  the  words  and  idioms  in  it, 
as  well  as  for  its  correct  description  of  the 
state  of  the  country.

THE    GAELIC   JOURNAL.

EXTRACTS  FROM  THE  CORRECTED  LETTER. 
To  the  Editors  of  the  Irish-American. 

I  did  not  intend  to  say  any  more  about  th«  Gaelic  word 
chum  ;  but  the  article  that  appeared  in  the  last  issue  of 
the  Gaelic  Journal  has,  in  justice  to  the  Irish  language 
and  to  myself,  compelled  me  to  trouble  you  with  the 
following  letter. 

T.  O.  Russell. 

New  York,  April,  iSSS. 
To  the  Editor  of  the  Gaelic  Journal. 

I  am  sorry  you  did  not  reproduce  my  letter  in  the  Gaelic 
Journal  in  order  that  the  public  might  see  not  only  where 
you  and  I  differ  in  Irish  grammar,  but  where  we  differ  in 
other  things.  It  matters  very  little  what  my  knowledge 
of  Gaelic  is,  and  I  beg  to  assure  you  that  what  you  pub- 
lish about  my  ignorance  of  it,  gives  me  no  concern  at  all. 
The  testimony  of  a  man  who  would  say  that  do  caochag 
is  good  Gaelic  cannot  be  worth  much.  I  do,  however, 
say  that  you  do  me  a  great  injustice  when  you  imply  that  I 
insulted  Mr.  Comyn  in  any  published  correspondence  of 
mine.  I  hope  that  I  am  not  fishwife  enough  to  insult  a 
man  when  I  am  three  thousand  miles  away  from  him.  I 
do  not  often  insult  people;  but  when  I  do,  it  is  to  their 
face  («"). 

Chum  either  governs  the  genitive  or  it  does  not ;  if  it 
governs  it  in  one  instance,  I  can  hardly  see  how  it  can  fail 
to  govern  it  in  every  instance,  that  is  if  we  wish  to  convey 
our  meaning  exactly.  For  instance,  if  chum  fear  do 
phósadh  means,  as  you  say  it  does,  "  to  marry  a  man," 
it  cannot  also  mean  "to  marry  men,"  which  I  maintain 
is  the  meaning  of  it.  I  asked  more  than  a  dozen  men 
from  Clare,  Cork,  and  Kerry  what  was  the  meaning  of 
the  phrase  chum  anjhir  do phósadh,  and  they  all  answered, 
unhesitatingly,  "  to  marry  a  man;"  now  if  chum  an  fhir 
do  phósadh  means  "to  many  a  man,"  chum  f^ar  do 
phósadh  must  mean  "  to  marry  men." 

This  matter  should  for  the  sake  of  the  Irish  Language 
be  settled  by  some  person  or  persons  who  are  fully  com- 
petent to  speak  positively  about  it.  I  know  only  three 
gentlemen  on  your  side  of  the  Atlantic  who  are,  or  at 
least  ought  to  be,  fully  competent  to  speak  authoritatively 
on  the  subject ;  these  are  Mr.  Whitley  Stokes,  Mr.  W. 
M.  Hennessey  and  Mr.  Atkinson  (I  do  not  know  his 
initials).  I  respectfully  ask  these  gentlemen  to  give  their 
opinion  publicly  about  chum  ;  and  if  the  opinions  of  all 
three  are  the  same,  let  you  and  I,  and  every  one  who  will 
write  Gaelic  in  future,  follow  their  advice. 

Permit  me  to  say,  in  conclusion,  that  it  is  for  the  sake  of 
the  Irish  language,  and  for  its  sake  alone,  that  I  have 
written  you  this  communication.  If  your  article  had  been 
on  any  other  subject,  and  had  contained  the  same  offensive 
personalities  towards  me  that  your  article  in  the  Gaelic 
Journal  contains,  I  should  have  considered  it  unworthy  of 
the  slightest  notice  on  my  part. 

T.  O'N.  R. 

Remarks: — "Does  cum  always  govern  genitive  case 
before  the  infinitive  ?" 

Within  the  last  couple  of  weeks  a  lover  of  the  old  tongue 
asked  me  why  I  was  bestowing  so  much  labour,  and  time, 
and  space,  on  Mr.  O'Neill  Russell.  I  replied  that  I  was, 
of  course,  aware  his  lucubrations  were  not  worth  this  trouble, 
but  that  the  enemies  of  the  Irish  language  on  this  side  of 
the  water  were  utilizing  these  lucubrations,  that  the  journal 
was  the  only  check  on  those  who  had  an  interest  in  destroy- 
ing the  language,  and  that  for  the  preservation  of  the 
journal,  it  was  necessary  to  counteract  these  lucubrations, 


and  to  show  the  people  that  what  Mr.  Russell  was  assert- 
ing with  such  flippancy  was  without  any  foundation  in 
fact,  but  calculated  from  its  very  audacity  to  mislead  the 
people,  who  unfortunately  know  but  very  little  about  the 
Irish  language. 

Examining  the  articles  dealing  with  Mr.  Russell  in  the 
Gaelic  Journal,  I  find  that  these  articles  contain  nearly  all 
the  tangible  assertions  in  Mr.  Russell's  letters,  without  any 
garbling,  and  that  therefore  it  is  not  necessary  to  give  his 
corrected  letter  at  length, 

(I.)  Doctor  O'Donovan  wrote,  Ir.  Gr.,  p.  3S6,  "That 
both  modes  of  construction  are  allowable,  like  the  gerunds 
and  gerundives  in  Latin."  I  said  the  same  thing  in 
November,  1S83,  and  I  repeated  it  in  the  Gaelic  Journals 
Nos.  28  and  30.  The  readers  of  the  Irish- American,  as  a 
rule,  cannot  know  these  facts,  and  Mr.  O'Neill  Rus- 
sell writing  to  them  quite  forgets  these  facts  also,  and 
these  readers  are  left  under  the  impression  that  we  totally 
disallow  the  gen.  after  cum  before  the  infinitive. 

(2.)  I  plead  guilty  to  speaking  Irish  in  the  cradle,  and 
to  reading  the  Irish  catechism  a  few  years  later,  and  to 
reading  and  writing  Irish  in  my  tenth  year — exactly  sixty- 
four  years  ago.  As  to  the  other  portion  of  Mr.  Russell's 
charge,  a  little  more  than  eleven  years  since  the  First 
Irish  Book  of  the  old  Society  for  the  Preservation  of  the 
Irish  Language  was  published  ;  it  was  immediately  at- 
tacked in  the  Irish  Times  and  in  Saunders's  Newsletter  by 
a  bizar  and  Bedel  Scholar  of  Trinity  College.  Some  three 
members  of  the  society  attempted  to  lift  the  little  book  out 
of  the  mud  in  which  iis  assailant  was  trampling  upon  it, 
but  their  attempts  were  feeble.  I  was  at  the  time  in  the 
country.  Not  a  member  of  the  society  knew  me ;  but  the 
case  was  desperate,  and  I  was  written  to  by  the  Society  to 
come  to  the  rescue.  I  wrote  two  letters  to  the  Irish  Times. 
The  second,  printed  in  that  journal  22nd  December,  1877, 
finished  the  matter.  Mr.  Russell  when  penning  the  para- 
graph above  knew  this  as  well  as  I  did. 

In  the  June  following  the  Society  wished  to  present  an 
address  to  a  Scotch  M.P.,  Mr.  Frazer  Macintosh,  and  they 
had  to  ask  me  to  write  it,  though  Mr.  Russell  was  then  a 
member  of  the  society,  and  on  the  spot.  But  the  readers 
of  the  Irish-American  did  not  know  these  things — very 
few  of  them  ever  will.  Mr.  Russell  knew  he  was  quite 
safe  in  raising  a  laugh  at  the  expense  of  thuscwho  spoke 
Irish  in  the  cradle. 

This  perhaps  may  be  a  fitting  place  to  notice  another 
instance  of  the  use  of  both  forms  after  cum.  In  Dr. 
O'Reilly's  Irish  Catechism — the  catechism  most  extensively 
used  in  Ireland  in  the  last  century,  and  in  the  first  quarter 
of  this — at  p.  17,  we  find  "  chun  a  heirvise  do  dheanav," 
and  at  p.  34,  "chun  ar  greidiov  do  advail  go  hosgailte." 

In  the  corrected  letter  (April,  1S88),  Mr.  Russell  writes: 
"I  do,  however,  say  that  you  do  me  a  great  injustice 
when  you  imply  that  I  insulted  Mr.  Comyn  in  any  pub- 
lished correspondence  of  mine.  I  hope  I  am  not  fishwife 
enough  to  insult  a  man  when  I  am  three  thousand  miles 
from  him.  I  do  not  often  insult  people ;  but  when  I  do, 
it  is  to  their  face." 

Here  again,  Mr.  Russell  felt  quite  safe.  But  why  did 
he  make  use  of  the  terms,  "  imply  "  and  "  published  ?" 

I  never  implied  that  his  correspondence  with  Mr.  Comyn 
was  published.  I  gave  Mr.  Comyn's  own  words,  and  I 
now  give  a  few  mure  of  them.  At  the  point  where  I 
stopped  quoting,  G.  /.,  vol.  i.,  p.  292,  Mr.  Comyn  added  : 
"  In  his  (Mr.  Russell's)  last  article  (p.  255),  hehasnuaidhe 
instead  of  nuadha,  for  the  plur.  of  nuadh,  the  former  being 
the  comparative.  There  are  several  other  solecisms  we 
could  point  out  and  suggestions  we  could  make  as  to  the 
construction  of  phrases  in  his  writings,  had  we  time,  space, 
or  inclination  for  such  work."     At  p.  265,  Mr.  Comyn 


THE   GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


wrote  :  "  We  cannot  meddle  in  controversies  not  concern- 
ing ourselves.  Do  give  up  using  strong  language,  as 
when  people  are  doing  their  best  it  is  of  no  use.  Please 
do  not  write  in  future  on  flimsy  paper  and  in  pencil,  at 
least  any  of  your  Gaelic  contributions.  This  practice  en- 
tails a  great  deal  of  trouble  on  our  printers  and  ourselves." 
Mr.  Russell  in  the  corrected  letter,  says : — 
"  (m-)  I  thank  you  for  pointingout  the  errors  in  my  letter 
in  the  Gaelic  Journal  in  1SS3  ;  and  since  you  have,  by 
dealing  in  personalities  yourself,  forced  me  to  be  personal 
and  speak  of  a  few  matters  about  which  I  never  intended 
to  make  any  public  utterance,  permit  me  to  say  that  the 
Gaelic  letter  or  article  out  of  which  you  cull  those  sup- 
positious errors  of  mine,  waa  not  printed  as  I  wrote  it ;  and 
it  was  because  my  letters  or  articles  in  the  Gaelic  Journal 
used  not  to  be  printed  as  I  wrote  them,  that  made  me  cease 
corresponding  with  it. 

"T.  O.  Russell." 

As  to  paragraph  («-),  I  have  to  give  the  most  unre- 
served contradiction  to  Mr.  Russell.  I  never  bestowed 
more  care  on  anything  than  on  the  printing  of  his  letter  of 
November,  1883.  I  was  at  the  time  undertaking  to  edit 
the  Gaelic  Journal  with  a  heavy  heart.  The  load  of  debt 
left  upon  the  periodical  was  crushing  us,  and  we  expected 
great  help  from  Mr.  Russell  towards  wiping  out  this  debt ; 
it  was  the  broken  reed  we  were  leaning  upon,  but  we 
thought  otherwise.  Every  error  in  the  letter  was  Mr. 
Russell's.  There  is  not  a  printers'  error  among  them  ; 
printers'  errors  are  easily  known.  Had  the  errors  in  the 
letter  been  committed  by  any  one  else  except  the  writer 
of  it,  there  would  have  been  some  complaints  about  them, 
and  with  justice.  Had  any  complaints  been  made  at  the 
time,  I  had  the  letter  in  my  hands,  as  Mr.  Comyn  had  on 
a  former  occasion.  But  at  the  end  of  four  years  Mr. 
Russell  knew  the  letter  was  gone,  and  hence  he  believed 
himself  out  of  danger. 

In  Mr.  Russell's  open  letter  we  have  seen  that  he  cited 
Dr.  O'Donovan  as  saying  the  very  reverse  of  what  the 
doctor  had  said,  and  this  with  O'Don.  Ir.  Gr.  in  his  hand. 
We  have  next  seen  him  asserting  that  I  quoted  but  one 
authority  while  looking  into  the  journal,  No.  28,  where  I 
had  quoted  five  other  authorities  in  addition  to  this  one. 
But  there  was  no  danger  that  the  readers  of  the  Irish- 
American  would  ever  detect  these  deviations  from  the 
veracities.  Strange  it  is  that  those  who  had  known  Mr. 
Russell  here  can  hardly  believe  their  eyes  when  they  see 
his  name  at  the  foot  of  the  letters  containing  these  asser- 
tions. 

Ourreaders  will  recollect  that  the  reason  especially  urged 
by  Mr.  Russell  for  his  anxiety  about  the  Irish  language 
in  the  case  of  cum  followed  by  an  accusative,  was  lest  an 
ambiguous  mode  of  expression  should  be  foisted  into  the 
language.  We  have  seen,  too,  how  causeless  was  this 
anxiety.  More  than  a  dozen  of  our  best  Irish  scholars 
having  written  and  spoken  to  the  people  and  for  the 
people  in  this  dreaded  formula  without  a  single  instance  of 
any  misunderstanding  having  arisen  out  of  its  use.  Let 
us  see,  on  the  other  hand,  is  there  not  only  danger  of  am- 
biguity, but  a  certainty  of  it,  in  the  method  recommended 
by  Mr.  Russell.  I  gave  an  instance  of  this  in  No.  28, 
and  I  here  repeat  it  :  ouató  pé  cum  bó  x>o  cedtiiiAc  ; 
here  no  one  can  say  whether  it  is  a  cow  or  cows.  Simi- 
larly, cum  caopẃc  tjo  beuprwvó,  means  to  shear  a  sheep 
or  more  sheep  than  one.  In  the  fifth  declension  of  nouns 
there  are  nearly  fifty  nouns  like  these  whose  gen.  sing,  and 
plur.  are  alike,  and  how  has  ambiguity  in  the  use  of  them 
been  avoided  ?  by  changing  the  form  of  expression,  or  by 
using  the  accusative  after  turn  :  thus,  cum  bd  vo  ceami&t ; 
cttm   CAOijMJ  x>Q  beẃ]\ri<rò.      Nouns  of    the  fourth  de- 


clension ending  in  a  vowel  are  subject  to  a  like  am- 
biguity in  speaking.  Nobody  in  speaking  can  distinguish 
<sipne,  a  sloe,  from  dipneww,  of  sloes:  Giteijvna,  a 
lord,  from  ci  jeAi\ri<vò,  of  lords.  To  avoid  this  ambi- 
guit)',  one  should  say  cum  AirvtnT>e  •oo  buAtn  ;  cum 
cijeamion'óe  ■o'peicpn. 

Is  it  not  strange  that  Mr.  Russell  or  Mr.  M'Dermottdid 
not  point  out  this  real  danger  to  their  readers,  instead  of 
straining  at  an  imaginary  gnat — verily  they  have  swal- 
lowed the  camel,  hoofs  and  all. 

I  hope  I  shall  never  again  have  to  write  the  names  of 
these  gentlemen.  In  future  whenever  I  find  anyone 
hacking  the  old  tongue,  I  will  merely  point  this  out  with- 
out reasoning  with  those  who  are  incapable  of  under- 
standing reasons.  To  preserve  the  Irish  language,  and  to 
help  on  our  learners,  shall  henceforth  be  the  business  of 
the  Gaelic  Journal. — E.   G.  J. 

Now  that  we  have  done  with  Mr.  Russell,  it  is  sad  to 
say  that — for  the  baseless  assertions  above  :  for  saying 
that  I  had  given  but  one  instance  where  I  had  given  six, 
which  he  saw  before  his  eyes  ;  for  putting  into  the  mouths 
of  twelve  men  in  buckram  words  that  no  Irish  speaker  ever 
uttered,  there  has  been  no  explanation,  no  apology,  or 
palliation  offered.      Poor  humanity  ! 

We  need  all  the  indulgence  our  readers  can  afford  us 
for  this  issue.  Clarm  Chonchobŵip  has  partly  said  this. 
And  for  my  part,  I  have  been  for  weeks  on  weeks  unable 
to  do  little  from  indisposition.  Nor  were  our  disappoint- 
ments even  thus  limited. 

Our  good  correspondents,  Messrs.  M'Cabe,  Carmody, 
and  the  Sial<yooip  have  sent  interesting  matter  for  our 
Notes  and  Queries,  which  we  are  unwillingly  compelled 
to  hold  over.

volume  of  the  Gaelic  Journal,  a  feat  accom- 
plished by  very  few  Irish  periodicals.  Our 
Penny  Journals  and  Penny  Magazines  were 
all  works  of  merit,  but  they  were  all  short- 
lived. The  first  volume  of  the  Dublin 
Penny  Journal  was  a  work  of  exceptional 
merit,  but  it  was  extinguished  in  one  year : 
more  copies  of  that  periodical  having  been 
sold  in  London  than  in  all  Ireland.  Such 
was  the  encouragement  given  by  Irishmen 
to  their  own  literature  half  a  century  ago, 
and  in  every  decade  of  years  since,  they 
have  allowed  some  periodical  to  die  of  in- 
anition. The  death  of  the  Gaelic  Journal 
in  its  third  or  fourth  number  was  confidently 
presaged  ;  and  since,  each  succeeding  num- 
ber was  to  be  its  last.  But  here  it  is  at  the 
conclusion  of  its  third  volume,  apparently 
with  as  few  symptoms  of  death  upon  it  as 
at  any  time  since  the  issue  of  its  first 
number. 

It  is  true  that  the  illness  of  some  members 
of  the  small  staff  of  the  Journal  often  puts  its 
publication  in  abeyance.  Forinstance,No.3i 
was  all  but  finished  off  by  the  printers  for  six 
weeks,  and  in  that  time  neither  the  Secretary 
nor  the  Editor  could  do  the  little  required 
to  put  it  into  the  hands  of  our  subscribers  : 
and  when  at  last  it  reached  them,  there 
were  more  press  errors  than  the  average  in 
it.  When  it  was  printed  off,  there  were 
materials  enough  in  my  hands  to  begin  the 
printing  of  the  present  issue  in  a  week — 
but  illness  again  laid  an  embargo  upon  us. 


In  my  case,  there  is  an  almost  insuperable 
impediment;  I  cannot  see  small  things 
distinctly  by  artificial  light :  dots  wanting 
or  misplaced,  etc.,  thus  escape  my  notice, 
and  annoy  our  young  readers  especially. 
With  the  long  and  fine  days  I  expect  to  do 
things  better. 

We  have  lost  two  members  of  our  Council 
since  the  issue  of  our  last  number.  William 
M.  Hennessy  was  perhaps  the  best  all- 
round  Irish  scholar  of  the  last  quarter  of  a 
century.  It  was  thought  that  he  would  be 
the  last  of  our  Irish  scholars  :  the  question 
would  he  be,  was  asked  about  a  dozen  of 
years  since  in  a  high-class  English  perio- 
dical. It  can  be  now  answered  in  the 
negative,  without  any  hesitation.  His 
knowledge  of  modern  Irish  gave  him  an 
incalculable  advantage  over  those  who  had 
not  this  knowledge.  Yet,  strange  to  say, 
he  had  a  dislike,  an  aversion  I  may  call  it, 
to  the  modern  language.  Unfortunately, 
during  this  century  the  modern  Irish  has 
been  in  the  hands  of  shams  and  humbugs — 
to  these  he  had  an  inveterate  dislike  ;  and 
to  this,  I  believe,  his  slighting  the  modern 
language  was  due.  Father  O'Carroll,  the 
other  member  lost  to  us,  was  a  man  of  ex- 
traordinary linguistic  powers — nor  were  his 
talents  as  a  poet  less,  in  my  opinion.  His 
knowledge  of  Irish  was  also  extraordinary, 
for  a  person  who  had  no  colloquial  acquaint- 
ance with  the  language,  and  who  studied  it 
only  for  a  short  time.  His  poetry  in  the 
earlier  numbers  of  the  Gaelic  Journal  shows 
talents  of  an  order  so  high,  that  they  might 
be  called  genius.  But  it  proves  more  clearly 
still  that  talents,  or  even  genius,  will  not

give  a  mastery  of  the  Irish  language  with- 
out a  knowledge  of  its  idioms — and  to  this 
knowledge  there  is  no  royal  road  :  it  must 
be  acquired  shortly  after  leaving  the  cradle, 
or  by  persons  of  talent  and  education,  after 
long  years  of  application.  Of  persons  who 
have  acquired  a  knowledge  of  Irish  idioms 
in  this  way,  I  have  known  two,  and  no  more; 
and  one  of  these  is  now  a  contributor  to 
the  Gaelic  Journal.  That  the  Irish  language 
can  be  used  as  a  medium  in  which  to  ex- 
press all  kinds  of  poetical  composition, 
admits  of  no  doubt.  Many,  very  many,  of 
Father  O'Carroll's  lines  in  the  Gaelic  Journal 
have  a  depth  of  feeling  that  scholars  here- 
after will  admire  :  and  the  short  piece  to 
his  memory  under-written  will  show  the  fit- 
ness of  the  Irish  tongue  for  another  species 
of  metre,  hitherto  unknown  in  it.  One  of 
the  saddest  episodes  connected  with  the 
Irish  language  movement  was  the  attacks 
that  drove  Father  O'Carroll  from  the  Gaelic 
Union.  But  this  is  not  a  time  to  say  more 
upon  this  painful  subject. 

And  what  are  the  future  prospects  of  the 
Irish  language  ?  At  present  there  is  no 
prospect  of  the  revival  of  the  language  as  a 
spoken  language  :  nor  is  there  any  prospect 
of  its  being  made  the  medium  of  instruction 
in  English — the  selfishness,  if  not  the  trea- 
chery of  the  officials  in  the  S.P.I. L.  in  1878 
dashed  into  fragments  the  last  organization 
that  had  a  chance  of  inducing  the  legisla- 
ture to  grant  this  boon  to  the  poor  children 
of  the  sea-board.  That  organization  had 
sufficient  momentum  to  obtain  for  Sir 
Patrick  Keenan  the  necessary  powers  to 
put  his  plans  into  operation.  But  that 
chance  being  l°st,  it  only  remains  for  the 
lovers  of  the  old  tongue  so  far  to  encour- 
age its  cultivation  as  to  fit  Irish-speaking 
children — such  of  them  as  may  hereafter 
become  Irish  scholars  and  philologists — to 
edit  our  MS.  Materials  :  and  this  in  all 
human  probability  will  be  done  by  some  of 
the  pupils  now  learning  to  read  Irish  in  the 
national  schools.  Last  year  400  children 
in  these  schools  competed  in  Irish  for  the 
prizes  offered  by  a  member  of  the  Gaelic 
Union,  the  Rev.  Euseby  D.  Cleaver,  the 
prizes  in  nearly  all  cases  being  awarded  by 
the  managers  of  the  schools,  chiefly  priests. 


While  others,  in  their  zeal  for  the  Irish 
language,  have  been  putting  money  in  their 
own  pockets,  some  members  of  the  Gaelic 
Union  have  been  constantly  giving  their 
labour  or  their  money  for  the  cultivation  of 
the  language.  The  pupils  in  the  inter- 
mediate schools  will  never  do  a  great  deal 
for  the  language.  Ninety  per  cent,  of  them 
will  lose  what  they  will  have  learned  of  it, 
as  soon  as  their  school-days  are  over,  just 
as  they  lose  their  Greek,  simply  because 
they  do  not  speak  or  understand  the  Irish 
any  more  than  the  Greek.  Even  in  the 
intermediate  establishments,  where  the 
teacher  is  capable  and  zealous,  a  few  of  the 
pupils  will  become  Irish  scholars;  but 
where  the  teacher  "  does  not  care  a  d — n  " 
for  the  Irish  tongue,  and  knows  a  little  of  it, 
just  as  a  parrot  would,  it  goes  without  telling 
that  the  pupils  will  return  to  their  homes 
with  just  as  much  Irish  as  to  say  a'  -o-cuij- 
eŵnn  ci'i. 

It  is  well  that  the  lovers  of  the  old  tongue 
should  be  fully  convinced  of  the  fact  that 
there  is  an  Irish  school — if  it  can  be  so 
called — which  almost  entirely  consists  of 
those  who  do  not  speak  the  language,  and 
whose  attempts  at  writing  it  are  a  jargon  ; 
not  Irish,  nor  any  other  dialect  under 
heaven.  Mr.  Whitley  Stokes  speaks  of  the 
"jargon  called  modern  Irish,"  of  which  he 
does  not  know  a  word,  and  a  knowledge  of 
which  would  have  saved  him  from  blunders 
innumerable.  Mr.  J.J.  MacSweeney  whis- 
pers that  "  fishwomen  "  only  speak  Irish 
now.  Messrs.  R.  J.  O'Duffy  and  T.  O'Neill 
Russell  make  our  scholars  say  quite  the 
contrary  of  what  they  had  said.  Mr.  Russell 
does  this  as  directly  and  with  as  little 
hesetancy  as  the  writer  of  the  fac-simile  letter 
could  do:  while  Mr.  O'Duffy  says  what  he 
would  have  people  believe,  in  words  that 
suggest  his  meaning,  an  untruthful  one,  but 
which,  when  examined  closely,  convey  no 
meaning  at  all.  The  members  of  this  school 
must  destroy  the  Irish  language,  or  be  wiped 
out  themselves.  Hence  theyhave  noscruples 
as  to  the  means  they  employ  to  gain  their 
ends  :  and,  looking  upon  the  Gaelic  Union 
as  almost  the  only  obstacle  in  their  way,  no 
effort  is  spared  to  destroy  this  organization. 
For   instance,  immediately   before  Father

Nolan  and  Mr.  David  Comyn  took  the  fatal 
step  of  leaving  the  Society  they  had  founded 
they  had  a  disagreement  with  Mr.  Mac- 
Sweeney  in  respect  of  the  election  of  the 
Council  of  the  Society  then  taking  place. 
As  on  all  other  occasions,  Mr.  MacSweeney 
carried  his  point, and  the  other  party  shortly 
after  seceded.  This  was  ten  years  ago. 
There  was  no  Gaelic  Union  then,  nor  for 
years  after.  The  Union  was  founded  by 
Father  Nolan  and  David  Comyn,  as  the 
older  Society  had  been  ;  but  when  they  had 
fairly  begun  to  gain  the  public  confidence 
and  sympathy,  Father  Nolan  was  REMOVED; 
others  say  he  was  hunted.  This  was  the 
most  fatal  blow  given  to  the  Irish  language 
since  the  secession.  Father  Nolan  and  Mr. 
Comyn  left  the  Gaelic  Union.  Those  who 
remained  were  making  a  life-and-death 
struggle  to  keep  the  Gaelic  Journal  above 
water,  when  another  blow  was  aimed  at  the 
Union.  A  gentleman  was  instructed  to  go 
to  a  certain  quarter  and  to  represent  the 
election  disagreement  spoken  of  above  as 
something  superlatively  bad  on  the  part  of 
the  Gaelic  Union,  i.e.,  of  the  Union  as  then 
in  existence.  This  representation  was  made 
to  those  with  whom  the  Union  would  espe- 
cially wish  to  stand  well  ;  it  is  only  a  couple 
of  years  since  this  representation  was  made, 
at  which  time  there  was  not  a  single  indi- 
vidual in  the  Union  who  knew  that  the  elec- 
tion quarrel  ever  took  place.  In  fact, the  Irish 
Volunteers  might  with  as  much  truth  and 
justice  be  blamed  with  taking  a  part  in  this 
difference,  whatever  it  was,  as  the  Gaelic 
Union  :  and  yet  a  gentleman,  who  could  of 
his  own  knowledge  know  absolutely  nothing 
of  the  case,  was  induced  to  make  charges 
of  the  truth  or  falsehood  of  which  he  was 
as  ignorant  as  the  "  Man  in  the  Moon." 
What  he  stated,  or  was  instructed  to  state, 
I  do  not  of  course  know.  But  I  know 
quite  well  that  he  was  correct  when  he  re- 
ported that  he  had  put  a  "  nail  in  the  quick 
of  the  Gaelic  Union  :"  and  he  exulted  in 
this  as  a  praiseworthy  deed. 

Such  are  the  blows  aimed  at  the  Gaelic 
Union  at  short  intervals  since  it  was 
founded  :  and  unfortunately  there  are  strong 
parties  backing  those  who  are  firing  from 
behind  the  fence.     There  is  no  time  to  say 


more  for  the  present.  Will  not  those  who 
love  the  old  tongue  tvitk  an  unselfish  love 
give  us  their  support  and  their  sympathy  ? 
It  is  essentially  necessary  that  the  Gaelic 
Journal  should  live  a  few  years  more — 
surely  those  who  would  destroy  the  country's 
language  for  greed  or  vanity  will  not  be 
allowed  to  have  their  way  !

THE   GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


livered  by  himself  to  a  New  York  audience,  published 
under  his  own  supervision  in  the  Irish  American,  and  re- 
printed  in  the  Gaelic  Journal,  No.  31,  Mr.  Russell  said  : 
"  I  am  much  obliged  to  him  (Ed.  G.  J.)  for  the  errors  he 
has  pointed  out ;  but  am  not  sure  that  they  can  be  fairly 
charged  to  me,  for  he  copied  my  article  most  incorrectly. 
He  has  'asus'  for  'agus,'  '  beagnath  '  for  'beagnach,' 
'  amrus  '  for  '  amhrus,'  '  etc'  "  The  etc.  is  an  imaginary 
quantity  ;  and  the  only  misprints  in  the  article  as  printed 
in  the  Gaelic  Journal  ate  putting  a/  for  a  c  in  "  beagnach," 
and  the  omission  of  a  dot  over  the  m  in  amhrus — and  these 
misprints  did  not  add  the  weight  of  a  feather  to  Mr. 
Russell's  mistakes  ;  these  mistakes  or  solecisms  are  all  his 
own  ;  and  well  he  knows  that  they  are.  In  fact,  the  article 
was  not  copied  at  all  ;  the  Irish-American  in  which  it 
appeared  was  handed  to  the  printer,  who  reproduced  it  in 
the  Gaelic  Journal  with  these  two  misprints  : — "  asus  "  for 
"  agus  "  was  in  the  Irish-American.  Shifting  his  own 
errors  to  other  shoulders  is  an  old  trick  with  Mr.  O. 
Russell.  Mr.  David  Comyn,  former  Editor  of  the  Gaelic 
Journal,  wrote  at  page  292,  No.  9,  of  the  journal,  "  We 
have  been  very  careful  to  print  this  and  other  recent  letters 
of  \\\%verbatim  et literatim,  as  they  appear  in  Mr.  Russell's 
MS.  We  are  consequently  surprised  that  he  should  still 
find  fault  with  our  action.  When  we,  with  his  own 
permission,  made  certain  changes  in  previous  con- 
tributions, he  objected;  now  when  we  refrain  from 
doing  anything  of  the  kind,  he  is  not  pleased.  We 
have  carefully  examined  the  manuscript  of  his  letter 
(which  he  says  we  printed  so  incorrectly),  and  we  find 
that  every  one  of  the  errors  he  points  out  appears  in  his"" 
own  handwriting  except  the  omission,  by  oversight,  of  one 
letter  in  the  word  dtarmad."  Mr.  Comyn  omitted  one 
letter,  and  he  was  charged  with  all  Mr.  Russell's  "mis- 
takes." I,  or  rather  the  printer,  omitted  a  dot  and 
substituted  one  letter  for  another,  and  Mr.  Russell  washes 
his  hands  out  of  all  the  errors  in  twenty  excerpts  taken 
out  of  his  address.  But,  as  in  Mr.  Comyn's  case,  it  will 
not  do.  The  Gaelic  Journal  is  to  hand.  Mr.  Ü.  Russell's 
letter  is  to  be  had.  They  can  be  compared.  Nor  does 
Mr.  Russell's  washing  of  hands  stop  here.  As  is  well 
known,  I  corrected  some  dozen  errors  for  him  in  the 
Gaelic  Journal,  p.  141,  No.  17;  he  said  nothing  at  the 
time,  and  while  I  had  his  MS.  in  my  hands  ;  but  after 
four  years,  in  April,  1SS8,  he  writes  to  me  in  the  Irish- 
American  :  "Permit  me  to  say  that  the  Gaelic  letter  or 
article  out  of  which  you  cull  these  suppositious  errors  of 
mine  was  not  printed  as  I  wrote  it."  As  I  said  before,  I 
never  took  more  care  with  anything  than  with  the  printing 
of  that  article  ;  and  had  there  been  any  errors  in  it 
except  Mr.  O.  Russell's  he  would  have  made  some  noise 
in  the  world.  But  while  I  held  his  MSS.  he  held  his 
peace.  With  respect  to  the  address  in  No.  31  of  Journal. 
Let  two  of  you,  say  Patraic  and  Mr.  D.  Magner,  both  of 
New  York,  or  one  of  you  and  Captain  Norris,  compare 
the  Join  nil  with  the  Irish-American  and  state  the  results. 
Will  Mr.  Russell  send  you  the  Irish-American  for  the 
purpose  of  this  com  'ari-on  :  we  shall  see. 

You  will  take  notice  how  brave  a  man  grows  by  de- 
grees  When  Mr.  Russell  learned  that  Mr.  Comyn  had 
hi,  MSS.  he  held  his  tongue.  When  I  made  the  cor- 
rections, before  the  world,  in  his  letter  or  article — not  a 
word  from  him.  But  with  full  knowledge  that  his  ad- 
dress can  be  compared  with  the  reprint  of  it  in  the 
Journal,  he  runs  the  chance  of  escape,  and  says  that  this 
reprint  lias  been  "  most  incorrectly  "  copied.  And  how 
low  vanity  can  draw  down  a  full-grown  man  !  A  school- 
boy in  his  teens  would  feel  himself  humiliated  if  detected 
in  blaming  another  for  the  fault  himself  had  committed  ; 


and  here  is  a  man  of  exalted  stature  trying  to  transfer  his 
own  "mistakes"  to  others — Poor  humanity  ! 

You  already  know  that  Mr.  Russell,  after  the  cor- 
rections made  in  this  letter  in  1S83,  betook  himself  to  the 
study  of  the  Bible  for  the  four  following  years.  Besides 
the  Bible,  he  went  through  the  "  Lucerna  Fidelium," 
Donlevy's  Catechism,  etc.,  etc.,  seeking  for  weapons  with 
which  to  attack  the  Gaelic  Journal.  He  discovered  that 
the  compound  preposition  chum  is  sometimes  followed 
by  a  genitive  ca^e  before  a  verb  in  the  infinitive  mood, 
and  sometimes  by  an  accusative.  The  former  con- 
struction was  that  mostly  followed  by  the  older  writers,  as 
most  euphonious  ;  the  latter  by  the  moderns,  as  being 
that  chiefly  used  and  best  understood  by  the  people. 
This  is  the  case  especially  with  preachers  and  writers  of 
works  on  spiritual  instruction.  Some  sermoris  in  Irish  as 
now  spoken  were  published  in  the  Journal,  and  upon  these 
and  upon  the  editor  of  the  Journal  Mr.  Russell  poured 
out  the  vials  of  his  wrath.  He  in  an  open  letter  to  the 
editor  told  him  that  there  was  a  rule  of  grammar  which 
condemned  this  construction.  That  "no  one  but  some 
one  of  little  learning  and  great  '  brass '  [namely  the 
preacher  and  the  Editor  of  the  G.  Journal]  dared  to  dis- 
pute "  this  rule.  That  "  most  writers  on  grammar  have 
laid  it  down  as  a  rule  that  chum  governs  the  genitive. 
O'Donovan,  Joyce  and  Windisch  (and  they  are  considered 
the  best)  certainly  say  so  ;  they  say  nothing  about  ex- 
ceptions to  this  rule,  and,  it  is  to  be  presumed,  because  there 
are  no  exceptions." 

Was  not  this  brave  ?  O'Donovan  did  make  exception 
to  this  rule  in  his  grammar,  at  p.  364  and  at  p.  3S5  ;  and 
Mr.  O.  Russell  knew  this  as  well  as  you  or  I — he  had,  in 
fact,  the  grammar  before  his  eyes  while  penning  the 
above.  Brave  Mr.  Russell  !  More  brave  still  is  the  fol- 
lowing, written  in  the  Irish-American  in  April,  1S88  : — 

"You  (Ed.  G.  J.)  have  not  produced  (in  G.J.,  No.  28) 
a  single  instance  of  the  use  of  the  accusative  after  chum, 
but  one."  Now  instead  of  one,  I  produced  one  sanctioned 
by  Dr.  O'Donovan  and  Dr.  Stewart,  another  from  Wm. 
Williams,  a  third  from  the  grammar  of  the  General 
Assembly  in  Ireland,  a  fourth  from  the  translator  of 
Trompa  na  bh-Flaitheas,  and  a  fifth  from  the  Cloyne 
Catechism,  which  I  since  withdrew  as  not  sufficiently 
clear ;  not  to  mention  the  sermons.  How  Mr.  Russell 
rolled  all  these  into  one,  perhaps  you  could  say.  It  is 
more  than  twelve  months  since  Mr.  Russell  perpetrated 
this  latter  brave  act,  and  no  reader  from  Mr.  Russell's 
letters  could  since  learn  that  he  had  spoken  aught  but  truth, 
or  that  any  person  ever  wrote  the  accusative  after  chum, 
except  the  two  and  the  obscure  friar  mentioned  by 
Mr.  Russell,  or  that  these  two  would  allow  both 
constructions  just  as  John  O'Donovan  would.  And 
now,  how  stands  the  question  with  regard  to 
chum  ?  We  cited  six  high  authorities  who  had  u-ed  it 
contrary  to  Mr.  Russell's  orders,  and  we  have  since  made 
many  additions  to  this  list.  These  are:  Patrick  Den's 
translation  of  Think  Well  On't  ;  Eugene  O'Cavanagh's 
translation  of  same  book;  St.  Patrick's  Prayer  Book; 
Father  Conway's  Short  Catechism  ;  Morty  Kelleher's 
translation  of  Butler's  Catechism  ;  the  bean  chaointe  in  the 
County  of  Cork  ;  Thomas  Gleeson,  a  poet  of  Limerick  or 
Clare;  the  "Lucerna  Fidelium;"  Dr.  O'Reilly's  Irish 
Catechism  ;  Dr.  Gallagher's  Irish  Sermons  ;  a  Sermon  on 
the  Passion,  by  Father  Fitzgerald,  of  Ballingarry,  County 
Tipperary,  printed  by  Fowler  in  1S61.  The  following 
very  interesting  letter  from  a  member  of  the  Council  of 
the  Gaelic  Union,  Mr.  P.  O'Brien,  gives  three  authorities 
more  :  the  Book  of  Common  Prayer,  Father  Furlong  and 
another  translator  of  Butler's  Catechism,  fourteen  authori-

ties  in  addition  to  the  former  six — twenty  in  all.  All 
these  works  were  for  the  people,  and  understood  by  the 
people.  Mr.  O'Brien's  letter  proves — if  proof  were  re- 
quired—that the  people  would  not  understand  Mr.  Russell's 
formula.     This  is  Mr.  O'Brien's  letter  :— 

'•  Dear  Mr.  Fleming, — I  followed  with  interest  the 
discussion  which  you  and  Mr.  O'N.  Russell  carried  on  with 
regard  to  the  preposition  chum,  and  its  government  of 
nouns  in  the  genitive  case,  and  I  quite  agree  with  the 
statement  made  by  you  in  No.  28  of  the  Gaelic  Journal 
that  excellent  authorities  could  be  cited  pro  and  con  in 
both  instances.  But  amongst  the  people  who  speak 
nothing  but  Irish  in  the  south-west  of  Minister  at  the 
present  time,  the  leaning  is  in  favour  of  not  having  the 
noun  governed  by  chum  in  the  genitive  case  when 
followed  by  the  infinitive  mood.  For  instance,  if  you 
said,  '  Taim  ag  dul  air  an  aonach  chum  capuill  do 
cheanach, '  the  person  you  were  speaking  to  would  be 
.  under  the  impression  that  you  were  going  to  the  fair  to 
buy  horses,  and  not  a  horse.  In  support  of  this  construc- 
tion, too,  I  may  quote  the  Irish  version  of  Dr.  Butler's 
Catechism.  At  the  foot  of  page  21  it  says — '  Chum 
breitheamhnus  do  thabhairt  ;'  and  the  Rev.  J.  Furlong's 
Catholic  Prayer-book,  'The  Christian  Companion' 
(punted  in  1842),  at  nearly  the  top  of  page  140  : — '  Chum 
an  Briathar  Ioncolnuighthe  do  ghabhail.'  There  is  one 
writer  whose  competency  as  an  authority  will  scarcely  be 
questioned  on  the  point  at  issue,  viz.,  the  translator  of  the 
Irish  version  of  the  Book  of  Common  Prayer.  I  have  con- 
sulted three  different  editions  of  this  book,  printed  respec- 
tively in  1712,  1S56,  and  1861,  and  in  about  twenty  lines 
from  the  commencement  of  the  article  headed  '  Matri- 
mony '  I  find  in  each  the  following  :  '  Chum  an  fearso 
agus  an  bheanso  do  cheangal.'  It  would  be  wearisome 
to  dwell  longer  on  this  subject. 
"  Yours  truly, 

"Patrick  O'Brien. 
"Dublin,  May  ioth,  1889." 

It  is  now  eighteen  months  since  Mr.  O.  Russell 
addressed  his  open  letter  to  the  editor  of  the  Gaelic  Journal, 
and  he  has  followed  this  letter  up  with  a  series  of  other 
letters,  and  with  some  from  his  followers,  and  in  every 
one  of  these,  statements  have  been  made  as  unfounded  as 
those  we  have  pointed  out,  and  not  a  statement  of  these 
has  been  withdrawn,  though  in  nearly  every  instance  their 
divergence  from  truth  has  been  pointed  out  in  the  Gaelic 
Journal.  It  will  be  for  you  to  say  what  motives  impelled 
Mr.  Russell  to  this  singular  course.  Could  disappointed 
vanity  alone  have  urged  him  ?  Or  were  there  any  more 
sterling  inducements.  Mr.  Russell  left  the  original  S.P.I. 
Language  with  Father  Nolan  and  Mr.  David  Comyn. 
The  open  letter  was  a  mo-t  opportune  diversion  in  favour 
of  the  Society  at  a  time  when  its  secretary  was  announc- 
ing that  "none  but  fishwomen  now  speak  Irish."  You, 
my  friends,  will  have  the  courage  of  your  convictions,  and 
say  to  the  people  of  the  Lesser  and  Greater  Ireland  what 
motives  urged  on  Mr  O'Neill  Russell  in  his  attack  onthe 
Gaelic  Journal. 

I  am,  my  friends, 

Yours  sincerely,

TADHG    GAODHALACH— MR.    RUSSELL'S 
REMARKS    ON. 

These  remarks  were  printed  in  the  last  journal  in  the 
characters  ordinarily  used  in  printing  Irish  compositions  ; 
we  now  print  them  in  Roman  characters  for  newspapers 


that  have  no  other  characters  but  these,  and  in  order  that 
by  the  use  of  Italics  we  may  lay  before  our  readers  at  a 
glance  the  solecisms  and  blunders  of  a  man  "who  has  for  a 
wit,  then  for  a  poet  passed ;  turned  critic  next,  and  proved 
a  blank  at  last."  We  waste  our  space  and  time  on  a 
few  such  individuals  at  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic,  not 
willingly,  but  grudgingly,  and  for  the  purpose  of  rousing 
our  people,  especially  our  Irish  scholars,  to  a  sense  of 
shame,  by  laying  before  them  the  Vandalic  jargon  to  which 
these  would-be  scholars  would  reduce  one  of  the  most 
noble  languages  ever  spoken  by  human  beings.  Mr.  O. 
Russell  is  ashamed  of  this  address,  ninack  iongnadh  ;  and 
he  would  hint  in  an  ambiguous  way  that  it  was  printed  in- 
correctly in  the  Gaelic  Journal ;  but  the  Irish  scholars — 
Patraic,  Mr.  D.  Magner,  and  Mr.  P.  J.  Daly — will  tell 
the  world  that  the  two  misprints  in  the  journal  has  had  no 
more  to  do  with  these  errors  than  have  the  lost  books  of 
the  Bible.  Mr.  Russell  confesses  to  three  errors — no, 
"mistakes,"  in  the  address  :  two  bad  spellings,  dearmuid 
and  deacar,  and  one  solecism,  naoi  focail,  for  naoi  bh- 
focaih  He  attempts  to  defend  five  of  the  expressions 
impugned  ;  to  the  other  dozen  or  so,  he  gives  the  charity 
of  silence — a  very  wise  proceeding  on  his  part. 

My  Friends. — Mr. Whitley  Stokes  has  called  the  modern 
Irish  a  "jargon;"  he  does  not  understand  it.  He  is  one 
of  the  very  best  Celtic  scholars  alive  ;  but  I  refer  you  to 
the  Gaelic  Journal,  No.  27,  and  expect  you  to  say  that  he 
is  shown  in  the  article,  "  Find  and  the  Phantoms,"  in  that 
issue  of  the  journal,  to  have  committed  a  series  of  puerile 
blunders,  which  a  fair  knowledge  of  the  modern  Iri-,h 
would  have  saved  him  from.  In  the  same  article  Pro- 
fessor Zimmer,  the  other  Celtic  scholar  of  highest  repute, 
is  shown  to  have  fallen  into  similar  errors,  and  from  the 
same  cause.  In  No.  22  of  the  Journal  the  celebrated 
scholar,  Kuno  Meyer,  is  proved  to  have  misunderstood 
and  mistranslated  all  the  Irish  idioms  in  the  "  Battle  of 
Ventry  Harbour."  In  the  Journal,  Nos.  23  and  31,  the 
blunders  in  the  works  of  the  S.  P.  I.  L.  have  been  pointed 
out.  You  will  tell  the  people  of  Europe  and  America 
that  the  criticisms  of  the  Journal  in  all  these  articles  are 
honest  criticisms,  and  that  they  cannot  be  impugned. 
You  will  lay  emphasis  on  the  statement  that — "without 
an  early  acquaintance  with  Irish,  it  is  next  to  impossible  to 
learn,  in  after  life,  to  speak  or  write  the  language  cor- 
rectly." As  "one  modern  instance  more"  of  this  you 
will  point  to  the  "  mistakes  "  in  these  "  Remarks  "  of  Mr. 
Russell.  If  I  have  found  fault  with  any  correct  expression 
or  idiom  in  this  or  any  other  article  of  the  journal,  you 
will  say  so  without  any  hesitation.  The  following  is  the 
address  of  Mr.  Russell  : — 

"  Is  fad  anois  0  labhaireadh  aon  Ghaedhilig  in  san  sgoil 
seo,  agus  'si  mo  bharamhuil  go  n-deunann  sibh  dearmuid

THE   GAELIC   JOURNAL. 


livered  by  himself  to  a  New  York  audience,  published 
under  his  own  supervision  in  the  Irish  American,  and  re- 
printed in  the  Gallic  Journal,  No.  31,  Mr.  Russell  said  : 
"  I  am  much  obliged  to  him  (Ed.  G.  J.)  for  the  errors  he 
has  pointed  out ;  but  am  not  sure  that  they  can  be  fairly 
charged  to  me,  for  he  copied  my  article  most  incorrectly. 
He  has  'asus'  for  'agus,'  '  beagnath  '  for  'beagnach,' 
*  amrus  '  for  '  amhrus,'  '  etc'  "  The  etc.  is  an  imaginary 
quantity  ;  and  the  only  misprints  in  the  article  as  printed 
in  the  Gaelic  Journal  are  putting  a  /  for  a  c  in  "  beagnach, " 
and  the  omission  of  a  dot  over  the  in  in  amhrus — and  these 
misprints  did  not  add  the  weight  of  a  feather  to  Mr. 
Russell's  mistakes  ;  these  mistakes  or  solecisms  are  all  his 
own  ;  and  well  he  knows  that  they  are.  In  fact,  the  article 
was  not  copied  at  all  ;  the  Irish-American  in  which  it 
appeared  was  handed  to  the  printer,  who  reproduced  it  in 
the  Gaelic  Journal  with  these  two  misprints  : — "  asus  "  for 
"  agus  "  was  in  the  Irish-American.  Shifting  his  own 
errors  to  other  shoulders  is  an  old  trick  witli  Mr.  O. 
Russell.  Mr.  David  Comyn,  former  Editor  of  the  Gaelic 
Journal,  wrote  at  page  292,  No.  9,  of  the  journal,  "  We 
have  been  very  careful  to  print  this  and  other  recent  letters 
of  hisveróatim  et literatim,  as  they  appear  in  Mr.  Russell's 
MS.  We  are  consequently  surprised  that  he  should  still 
find  fault  with  our  action.  When  we,  with  his  own 
permission,  made  certain  changes  in  previous  con- 
tributions, he  objected;  now  when  we  refrain  from 
doing  anything  of  the  kind,  he  is  not  pleased.  We 
have  carefully  examined  the  manuscript  of  his  letter 
(which  he  says  we  printed  so  incorrectly),  and  we  find 
that  every  one  of  the  errors  he  points  out  appears  in  his 
own  handwriting  except  the  omission,  by  oversight,  of  one 
letter  in  the  word  dtarmad."  Mr.  Comyn  omitted  one 
letter,  and  he  was  charged  with  all  Mr.  Russell's  "  mis- 
takes." I,  or  rather  the  printer,  omitted  a  dot  and 
substituted  one  letter  for  another,  and  Mr.  Russell  washes 
his  hands  out  of  all  the  errors  in  twenty  excerpts  taken 
out  of  his  address.  But,  as  in  Mr.  Comyn's  case,  it  will 
not  do.  The  Gaelic  Journal  is  to  hand.  Mr.  Ü.  Russell's 
letter  is  to  be  had.  They  can  be  compared.  Nor  does 
Mr.  Russell's  washing  of  hands  stop  here.  As  is  well 
known,  I  corrected  some  dozen  errors  for  him  in  the 
Gaelic  Journal,  p.  141,  No.  17;  he  said  nothing  at  the 
time,  and  while  I  had  his  MS.  in  my  hands  ;  but  after 
four  years,  in  April,  1SS8,  he  writes  to  me  in  the  Irish- 
American  :  "Permit  me  to  say  that  the  Gaelic  letter  or 
article  out  of  which  you  cull  these  suppositious  errors  of 
mine  was  not  printed  as  I  wrote  it."  As  I  said  before,  I 
never  took  more  care  with  anything  than  with  the  printing 
of  that  article  ;  and  had  there  been  any  errors  in  it 
except  Mr.  Ü.  Russell's  he  would  have  made  some  noise 
in  the  world.  But  while  I  held  his  MSS.  he  held  his 
peace.  With  respect  to  the  address  in  No.  31  of  Journal. 
Let  two  of  you,  say  Patraic  and  Mr.  D.  Magner,  both  of 
New  York,  or  one  of  you  and  Captain  Norris,  compare 
the  Join  nal  with  the  Irish- American  and  stale  the  results. 
Will  Mr.  Russell  send  you  the  Irish- American  for  the 
purpose  of  this  comparison  :  we  shall  see. 

You  will  lake  notice  how  brave  a  man  grows  by  de- 
grees When  Mr.  Russell  learned  that  Mr.  Comyn  had 
his  MSS.  he  held  his  tongue.  When  I  made  the  cor- 
rections, before  the  world,  in  his  letter  or  article — not  a 
word  from  him.  But  with  full  knowledge  that  his  ad- 
dress can  be  compared  with  the  reprint  of  it  in  the 
Journal,  he  runs  the  chance  of  escape,  and  says  that  this 
reprint  has  been  "  most  incorrectly  "  copied.  And  how 
low  vanity  can  draw  down  a  full-grown  man  !  A  school- 
boy in  his  teens  would  feel  himself  humiliated  if  detected 
in  blaming  another  for  the  fault  himself  had  committed  ; 


and  here  is  a  man  of  exalted  stature  trying  to  transfer  his 
own  "mistakes"  to  others — Poor  humanity  ! 

You  already  know  that  Mr.  Russell,  after  the  cor- 
rections made  in  this  letter  in  1SS3,  betook  himself  to  the 
study  of  the  Bible  for  the  four  following  years.  Besides 
the  Bible,  he  went  through  the  "Lucerna  Fidelium," 
Donlevy's  Catechism,  etc.,  etc.,  seeking  for  weipons  with 
which  to  attack  the  Gaelic  Journal.  He  discovered  that 
the  compound  preposition  chum  is  sometimes  followed 
by  a  genitive  ca^e  before  a  verb  in  the  infinitive  mood, 
and  sometimes  by  an  accusative.  The  former  con- 
struction was  that  mostly  followed  by  the  older  writers,  as 
most  euphonious  ;  the  latter  by  the  moderns,  as  being 
that  chiefly  used  and  best  understood  by  the  people. 
This  is  the  case  especially  with  preachers  and  writers  of 
works  on  spiritual  instruction.  Some  sermorts  in  Irish  as 
now  spoken  were  published  in  the  Journal,  and  upon  these 
and  upon  the  editor  of  the  Journal  Mr.  Russell  poured 
out  the  vials  of  his  wrath.  He  in  an  open  letter  to  the 
editor  told  him  that  there  was  a  rule  of  grammar  which 
condemned  this  construction.  That  "no  one  but  some 
one  of  little  learning  and  great  '  brass '  [namely  the 
preacher  and  the  Editor  of  the  G.  Journal]  dared  to  dis- 
pute "  this  rule.  That  "  most  writers  on  grammar  have 
laid  it  down  as  a  rule  that  chum  governs  the  genitive. 
O'Donovan,  Joyce  and  YVindisch  (and  they  are  considered 
the  best)  certainly  say  so  ;  they  say  nothing  about  ex- 
ceptions to  this  rule,  and,  it  is  to  be  presumed,  because  there 
are  no  exceptions." 

■  Was  not  this  brave  ?  O'Donovan  did  make  exception 
to  this  rule  in  his  grammar,  at  p.  364  and  at  p.  3S5  ;  and 
Mr.  O.  Russell  knew  this  as  well  as  you  or  I — he  had,  in 
fact,  the  grammar  before  his  eyes  while  penning  the 
above.  Brave  Mr.  Russell  !  More  brave  still  is  the  fol- 
lowing, written  in  the  Irish-American  in  April,  iSSS  : — 

"You  (Ed.  G.  J.)  have  not  produced  (in  G.J.,  No.  28) 
a  single  instance  of  the  use  of  the  accusative  after  chum, 
but  one."  Now  instead  of  one,  I  produced  one  sanctioned 
by  Dr.  O'Donovan  and  Dr.  Stewart,  another  from  Win, 
Williams,  a  third  from  the  grammar  of  the  General 
Assembly  in  Ireland,  a  fourth  from  the  translator  of 
Trompa  na  bh-Flaitheas,  and  a  fifth  from  the  Cloyne 
Catechism,  which  I  since  withdrew  as  not  sufficiently 
clear ;  not  to  mention  the  sermons.  How  Mr.  Russell 
rolled  all  these  into  one,  perhaps  you  could  say.  It  is 
more  than  twelve  months  since  Mr.  Russell  perpetrated 
this  latter  brave  act,  and  no  reader  from  Mr.  Russell's 
letters  could  since  learn  that  he  had  spoken  aught  but  truth, 
or  that  any  person  ever  wrote  the  accusative  after  chum, 
except  the  two  and  the  obscure  friar  mentioned  by 
Mr.  Russell,  or  that  these  two  would  allow  both 
constructions  just  as  John  O'Donovan  would.  And 
now,  how  stands  the  question  with  regard  to 
chum  ?  We  cited  six  high  authorities  who  had  used  it 
contrary  to  Mr.  Russell's  orders,  and  we  have  since  made 
many  additions  to  this  list.  These  are  :  Pamck  Den's 
translation  of  Think  Well  On't  ;  Eugene  O'Cavanagh's 
translation  of  >ame  book;  St.  Patrick's  Prayer  Book; 
Father  Conway-  Short  Catechism;  Morty  Kelleher's 
translation  of  Butler's  Catechism  ;  the  bean  chaoinie  in  the 
County  of  Cork  ;  Thomas  Gleeson,  a  poet  of  Limerick  or 
Clare;  the  "Lucerna  Fidelium;"  Dr.  O'Reilly's  Irish 
Catechism  ;  Dr.  Gallagher's  Iiish  Sermons  ;  a  Sermon  on 
the  Passion,  by  Father  Fitzgerald,  of  Ballingarry,  County 
Tipperary,  printed  by  Fowler  in  1S61.  The  following 
very  interesting  letter  from  a  member  of  the  Council  of 
the  Gaelic  Union,  Mr.  P.  O'Brien,  gives  three  authorities 
more  :  the  Book  of  Common  Prayer,  Father  Furlong  and 
another  translator  of  Butler's  Catechism,  fourteen  authori-

ties  in  addition  to  the  former  six — twenty  in  all.  All 
these  works  w;ere  for  the  people,  and  understood  by  the 
people.  Mr.  O'Brien's  letter  proves — if  proof  were  re- 
quired— that  the  people  would  not  understand  Mr.  Russell's 
formula.     This  is  Mr.  O'Biien's  letter  : — 

'•  Dear  Mr.  Fleming, — I  followed  with  interest  the 
discussion  which  you  and  Mr.  O'N.  Russell  carried  on  with 
regard  to  the  preposition  chum,  and  its  government  of 
nouns  in  the  genitive  case,  and  I  quite  agree  with  the 
statement  made  by  you  in  No.  28  of  the  Gaelic  Journal 
that  excellent  authorities  could  be  cited  pro  and  con  in 
both  instances.  But  amongst  the  people  who  speak 
nothing  but  Irish  in  the  southwest  of  Minister  at  the 
present  time,  the  leaning  is  in  favour  of  not  having  the 
noun  governed  by  chum  in  the  genitive  case  when 
followed  by  the  infinitive  mood.  For  instance,  if  you 
said,  '  Taim  ag  dul  air  an  aonach  chum  capudl  do 
cheanach, '  the  person  you  were  speaking  to  would  be 
under  the  impression  that  you  were  going  to  the  fair  to 
buy  horses,  and  not  a  horse.  In  support  of  this  construc- 
tion, too,  I  may  quote  the  Irish  version  of  Dr.  Butler's 
Catechism.  At  the  fuot  of  page  21  it  says — '  Chum

writer  whose  competency  as  an  authority  will  scarcely  be 
questioned  on  the  point  at  issue,  viz.,  the  translator  of  the

sulted three  different  editions  of  this  book,  printed  respec- 
tively in  1712,  1856,  and  1861,  and  in  about  twenty  lines 
from  the  commencement  of  the  article  headed  '  Matri- 
mony '  I  find  in  each  the  following  :  '  Chum  an  fearso

"Patrick  O'Brien. 
"Dublin,  May  10th,  1889." 

It  is  now  eighteen  months  since  Mr.  O.  Russell 
addressed  his  open  letter  to  the  editor  of  the  Gaelic  Journal, 
and  he  has  followed  this  letter  up  with  a  series  of  other 
letters,  and  with  some  from  his  followers,  and  in  every 
one  of  these,  statements  have  been  made  as  unfounded  as 
those  we  have  pointed  out,  and  not  a  statement  of  these 
has  been  withdrawn,  though  in  nearly  every  instance  their 
divergence  from  truth  has  been  pointed  out  in  the  Gaelic 
Journal.  It  will  be  for  you  to  say  what  motives  impelled 
Mr.  Russell  to  this  singular  course.  Could  disappointed 
vanity  alone  have  urged  him  ?  Or  were  there  any  more 
sterling  inducements.  Mr.  Russell  left  the  original  S.P.I. 
Language  with  Father  Nolan  and  Mr.  David  Comyn. 
The  open  letter  was  a  mo-t  opportune  diversion  in  favour 
of  the  Society  at  a  time  when  its  secretary  was  announc- 
ing that  "none  but  fishwomen  now  speak  Irish."  You, 
my  friends,  will  have  the  courage  of  your  convictions,  and 
say  to  the  people  of  the  Lesser  and  Greater  Ireland  what 
motives  urged  on  Mr  O'Neill  Russell  in  his  attack  onthe 
Gaelic  Journal. 

I  am,  my  friends, 

Yours  sincerely, 
John  Fleming,  E.  G.J. 


TADHG    GAODHALACH— MR.    RUSSELL'S 
REMARKS    ON. 

These  remarks  were  printed  in  the  last  journal  in  the 
characters  ordinarily  used  in  printing  Irish  compositions  ; 
we  now  print  them  in  Roman  characters  for  newspapers 


that  have  no  other  characters  but  these,  and  in  order  that 
by  the  use  of  Italics  we  may  lay  before  our  readers  at  a 
glance  the  solecisms  and  blunders  of  a  man  "who  has  for  a 
wit,  then  for  a  poet  passed;  turned  critic  next,  and  proved 
a  blank  at  last."  We  waste  our  space  and  time  on  a 
few  such  individuals  at  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic,  not 
willingly,  but  grudgingly,  and  for  the  purpose  of  rousing 
our  people,  especially  our  Irish  scholars,  to  a  sense  of 
shame,  by  laying  before  them  the  Vandalic  jargon  to  which 
these  would-be  scholars  would  reduce  one  of  the  most 
noble  languages  ever  spoken  by  human  beings.  Mr.  O. 
Russell  is  ashamed  of  this  address,  ninaeh  iongnadh  ;  and 
he  would  hint  in  an  ambiguous  way  that  it  was  printed  in- 
correctly in  the  Gaelic  Journal ;  but  the  Irish  scholars— 
Patraic,  Mr.  D.  Magner,  and  Mr.  P.  J.  Daly — will  tell 
the  world  that  the  two  misprints  in  the  journal  has  had  no 
more  to  do  with  these  errors  than  have  the  lost  books  of 
the  Bible.  Mr.  Russell  confesses  to  three  errors — no, 
"mistakes,"  in  the  address  :  two  bad  spellings,  dearmuid 
and  deacar,  and  one  solecism,  naoi  focail,  for  naoi  bh- 
focail.  He  attempts  to  defend  five  of  the  expressions 
impugned  ;  to  the  other  dozen  or  so,  he  gives  the  charity 
of  silence — a  very  wise  proceeding  on  his  part. 

My  Friends, — Mr. Whitley  Stokes  has  called  the  modern 
Irish  a  "  jargon  ;"  he  does  not  understand  it.  He  is  one 
of  the  very  best  Celtic  scholars  alive  ;  but  I  refer  you  to 
the  Gaelic  Journal,  No.  27,  and  expect  you  to  say  that  he 
is  shown  in  the  article,  "  Find  and  the  Phanloms,"  in  that 
issue  of  the  journal,  to  have  committed  a  series  of  puerile 
blunders,  which  a  fair  knowledge  of  the  modern  Irish 
would  have  saved  him  from.  In  the  same  article  Pro- 
fessor Zimmer,  the  other  Celtic  scholar  of  highest  repute, 
is  shown  to  have  fallen  into  similar  errors,  and  from  the 
same  cause.  In  No.  22  of  the  Journal  the  celebrated 
scholar,  Kuno  Meyer,  is  proved  to  have  misunderstood 
and  mistranslated  all  the  Irish  idioms  in  the  "  Battle  of 
Ventry  Harbour."  In  the  Journal,  Nos.  23  and  31,  the 
blunders  in  the  works  of  the  S.  P.  I.  L.  have  been  pointed 
out.  You  will  tell  the  people  of  Europe  and  America 
that  the  criticisms  of  the  Journal  in  all  these  articles  are 
honest  criticisms,  and  that  they  cannot  be  impugned. 
You  will  lay  emphasis  on  the  statement  that — "without 
an  early  acquaintance  with  Irish,  it  is  next  to  impossible  to 
learn,  in  alter  life,  to  speak  or  write  the  language  cor- 
rectly." As  "one  modern  instance  more"  of  this  you 
will  point  to  the  "  mistakes  "  in  these  "  Remarks  "  of  Mr. 
Russell.  If  I  have  found  fault  with  any  correct  expression 
or  idiom  in  this  or  any  other  article  of  the  journal,  you 
will  say  so  without  any  hesitation.  The  following  is  the 
address  of  Mr.  Russell  : — 

"  Is  fad  anois  0  labhaireaJh  aon  Ghaedhilig  in  san  sgoil

daoinibh  eile  na  h-Eireann." 

Let  us  now  examine  those  alleged  errors  that  he  has 
undertaken  to  stand  by. 

(a)  In  excerpt  2  the  spellings  "  Iabhaireadh "  and 
labhaireann  are  said  in  the  journal  to  be  faulty,  and  Mr. 
Russell  replies  :  "When  he  [E.G./.]  says  that '  Iabhair- 
eadh' and  'labhaireann'  should  be  ' labharadh'  and 
'labkarann,'  he  shows  himself  to  be  no  Irish  grammarian 
at  all.  All  regular  verbs  must,  if  written  correctly,  con- 
tain the  root  intact  in  all  moods,  tenses,  and  voices, 
except  in  future  tense  and  conditional  mood  of  the  second 
conjugation.  See  O'Donovan's  Grammar,  page  210,  or 
Joyce's  Grammar,  where  he  gives  a  paradigms  (sic)  of 
regular  verbs."  You  will  proclaim  that  this  rule  is  an  in- 
vention of  Mr.  Russell's,  and  that  neither  Dr.  O'Donovan 
nor  Dr.  Joyce  has  ever  penned  any  such  rule,  or  anything 
like  it,  or  anything  from  which  it  could  be  inferred.  Nay, 
that  Dr.  Joyce  has  said  the  very  opposite  of  this  rule  as 
clearly  as  Dr.  O'Donovan  contradicted  the  rule  given  as 
his  by  Mr.  Russell  in  the  open  letter. 

At  p.  60,  sect.  4,  of  Joyce's  grammar,  we  find  :  "  If  the 
final  consonant  of  the  root  be  preceded  by  i,  as  part  of  a 
diphthong  or  triphthong,  the  final  vowel  is  made  broad  in 
the  infinitive — as  buail,  bualadh."  Here  "buail"  is  the 
root,  and  "  bualadh  "  the  infinitive  mood,  which  does  not 
contain  the  root  intact.  Again  at  p.  62,  par.  7,  Dr.  Joyce 
writes :  "In  the  other  tenses  of  the  indicative,  verbs  in  il, 
in,  ir,  and/j,  are  almost  always  syncopated  by  the  elision 
of  the  vowel  or  diphthong  preceding  the  final  root  con- 
sonant." Now,  labhair  is  the  root  of  a  regular  verb,  and 
labharthar  is  its  present  tense  passive  in  which  the  root 
is  not  found  intact,  though  this  verb  is  in  the  Bible  :  "Is 
riotsa  labharthar,"  Dan.  iv.,  31.  Scores,  hundreds  of  such 
verbs,  in  all  moods  and  tenses,  could  be  found  in  the 
Bible,  every  one  of  them  at  variance  with  Mr.  Russell  — 
how  he  contrived  not  to  see  them  it  is  hard  to  understand. 
A  certain  person,  much  given  to  quoting  the  Bible,  it  is 
said,  was  once  confronted  with  a  passage  point  blank  con- 


tradicting his  position ;  what  was  he  to  do  ?  He  boldly  as- 
serted that  the  text  was  not  in  the  Bible — so  the  spirit  in- 
formed him.  Whether  the  spirit  moved  Mr.  Russell  to 
ignore  all  these  passages  I  cannot  say  ;  but  the  spirit,  I 
hope,  did  not  reprove  him,  though  he  wrote  in  his  address 
labkraim,  which  does  not  contain  the  root  intact.  Mr. 
Russell  is  often  wrong  when  he  cites  the  Bible,  but  he  is 
always  wrong  when  he  does  not — because  he  then  finds 
the  Bible  point  blank  against  him  ;  and  when  he  refers  to 
a  grammar,  he  always  invents  a  facsimile  rule,  as  in  the 
instances  mentioned  above.  Another  thing  to  which  I  call 
your  attention.  In  the  excerpt  2,  in  the  Gaelic  Journal  I 
wrote  labkradh  and  labhrann,  and  these  Mr.  Russell 
copied  "  labharadh  "  and  "labharann" 

(b)  Excerpt  11.  "  Granuighthe  is  quite  right,"  said 
Mr.  Russell,  in  the  Citizen.  He  wrote  this  term  correctly 
in  the  address  :  "  grainighthe,"  but  wrong,  "  granuighthe," 
in  the  Citizen,  because  he  did  not  know  how  the  two 
words  differ  in  pronunciation  ;  nor  did  he  understand 
the  meaning  of  the  word  as  he  used  it  in  the  address. 
"Adeirim"  (said  he)  "nach  rabhas  nios  mo  grainighthe 
ariamh."  I  say  I  was  never  more  loathed  (more  detested) 
[than  in  reading  the  Pious  Miscellany].  He  meant  to 
say,  he  was  never  more  disgusted,  but  not  knowing  the 
signification  of  a  passive  verb,  he  said  the  other  :  "is  leor 
o'n  eolus  e."  And  this  is  not  reviling  the  memory  of  the 
author  of  the  book  that  so  disgusted  him  ;  and  which 
book,  "for  the  sake  of  the  Irish  language,"  he  would 
fling  into  the  fire — every  copy  of  it  extant. 

(c)  As  to  the  spelling  Laighin  (of  Leinster)  Mr.  Russell 
says:  " Lagin  is  spelled  rightly.  See  100  places  in  the 
Book  of  Leinster  :  '  Is  mor  an  techt  do  ringni  ri  Lagen.' 
Book  of  Leinster,  page  294.  In  the  address  he  spelled  it 
wrong,  'Laghain,' and  next  in  the  Citizen  he  spelled  it 
wrong,  'Lagin  ' :  perhaps  two  wrong  and  one  antique 
[spelling]  would  make  a  right." 

(d)  "Treas  na  bh-focal  is  quite  right  (said  Mr.  Russell). 
Cuid  is  of  course  understood  after  treas,  'Leis  an  treas 
cuid,' Numb.  15-6."  "  Treas  na  bh-focal '  is  not  Irish; 
nor  is  '  treas  cuid  na  bh-focal.  Mr.  Russell  saw  this,  and 
the  spirit  moved  him  as  usual  to  suppress  the  part  of 
Numb.  15-6  that  would  show  he  was  wrong.  The  whole 
passage  is:  'leis  an  treas  cuid  do  hin  ola,'  (hin,  a  measure), 
with  the  third  part  of  a  hin  of  oil.  Cuid,  the  whole, 
governs  the  gen.  as,  mo  chuid  airgid,  my  money,  (the 
whole  of  it)  :  cuid,  a. partitive,  takes  do,  or  de,  with  a  da- 
tive, as,  mo  chuid  de'n  airgiod,  my  share  of  the  money. 
Mr.  Russell  uses  cuid  twice  more  in  the  address,  and  even 
worse  than  here,  but  he  does  nut  try  to  defend  it.  These 
are,  "a  g-ceannaibh  do-chuid  eigean  na  n-daoineadh," 
and  "ina  coda  Thuidhg  Gaodhalaigh."  Even  in  the  word 
Gaodhalaigh  the  initial  g  should  be  aspirated.  There  are  at 
least  sixty  solecisms  of  one  kind  or  other  in  this  moiety  of 
the  address — or  to  speak  more  correctly,  it  is  not  Irish  at 
all.  Fad  o,  long  ago,  is  used  three  times  in  the  address. 
Do  sgriobh  innte  fad  o  is  correct  :  in  the  other  two 
passages  it  is  a  solecism — they  are  in  Italics.  To  annoy 
you  with  Mr.  Russeli's  tissues  of  blunders  would  be  an 
impertinence  ;  but  for  the  sake  of  our  beloved  language  it 
is  necessary  for  you  to  speak  out,  and  to  tell  the  world 
that  persons  like  Mr.  Russell,  who  have  learned  Irish 
late  in  life,  can  never  read  or  write  or  understand  it. 
This  address  is  as  good  a  case  in  point  as  can  be  given. 
It  lias  all  the  marks  of  preparation.  It  was  written  out ; 
got  by  rote  ;  spoken  to  an  audience ;  prepared  for  the 
press  ;  corrected  in  proof.  In  a  word  it  is  as  good  as 
Mr.  Russell  could  make  it,  and  yet  Mr.  Russell  could 
only  attempt  the  defence  of  five  out  of  the  scores  of  errors 
in  it :  no  wonder  that  he  would  disown  it. 

(1).  The  errors  in  the  address  are  of  two  kinds  :  those 


THE   GAELIC  JOURNAL. 


which  he  did  not  know  how  to  avoid,  and  these  nearly 
make  up  all  the  address,  and  (2)  those  which  were  so  easy 
that  he  did  not  look  into  any  authority  for  them.  Of  this 
kind  are  the  two  bad  spellings  that  Mr.  Russell  confessed 
to,  " dearmuiii"  and  "  deacar, "  and  the  solecism  "  naoi 
focail."  Another  bad  spelling  or  solecism  of  this  kind  is  the 
gen.  "  Tkadhg,"  in  the  beginning  of  the  address,  and  the 
unaspirated  g  of  Caodhalach  near  the  end.  You  have  also 
noticed  the  phrase  where  Mr.  Russell  makes  mure  than  a 
dozen  men  say  that  chum  am  fhir  do  phosadh  is  to  marry 
a  man  ;  also  that  he  cites  me  as  writing  labharadh  and 
labharann,  where  1  had  written  labhradh  and  labhrann.  In 
the  address  he  wrote  "  grainighthe"  correctly,  and  in  the 
letter  to  the  Citizen  "  granuighthc"  a  word  so  different  in 
sound  from  the  correct  word  that  none  of  you  would  spell 
it  so,  if  you  had  never  seeir  the  word  written,  but  only 
heard  it  once  pronounced. 

My  friends — You  have  left  this  country  without  Irish 
scholars  very  nearly,  and  almost  without  Irish  books.  The 
few  scholars  whom  you  left  behind  are  nearly  gone  ;  and 
in  a  short  time  you  must  close  up  your  ranks  to  fill  my 
place.  Proclaim  to  the  world  at  once  that  the  New  Irish 
is  not  Irish  ;  and  take  some  steps  to  have  your  children 
brought  up  as  Irish  speakers — some  effectual  steps.  You 
have  done  a  great  deal  to  create  a  taste  for  the  language, 
but  you  can  do  more.  The  language  has  as  many,  as 
po  ■  ci  ful,  and  as  artful  enemies  as  the  country  ever  had. 
How  can  we  defeat  them  ? 

Ever  yours, 

John  Fleming.

THE     HISTORY     OF     EDMOND 
O'CLEARY. 


At  p.  35,  No.  27,  of  the  Journal,  we  have 
said  nearly  all  we  have  had  to  sayof  Edmond 
O'Cleary  and  of  John  O'Neachtain.  But 
as  we  intend  giving  all  the  history  in  the 
Journal,  we  give  the  beginning  of  it  here, 
with  a  request  to  our  readers  to  look  again 
at  what  has  already  been  said  of  the  tale  and 
of  its  author  in  the  Journal.  Neither  in  wit  or 
humour  was  O'Neachtain  inferior  to  Swift ; 
and  as  was  said  before,  the  language  is  the 
best  that  has  been  written  since  Keating's 
time.  The  words  in  a  few  sentences  in  the 
beginning  are  rather  long,  and  the  copy  of 
the  tale  in  our  hands  is  not  a  good  one ; 
but  "we  must  do  the  best  we  can.  The  de- 
scription of  Eorna's  children  and  of  the 
birth  of  Cuirm  Searbh  are  very  good  ;  but 
this  lesson,  on  the  whole,  is  the  least  interest- 
ing portion  of  the  History  of  Edmond 
O'Cleary.

KATE    OF    GARNAVILLA. 

[5a]kmi  or  gAjijiAn  is  a  grove  or  shrub- 
bery, and  bile  a  large  tree;  jjŵjiÁn  a'  bile, 
the  grove  of  the  large  tree,  is  situated  two 
miles  south  of  Cahir,  in  the  County  of 
Tipperary.] 

It  is  with  pleasure  we  present  our  readers 
with  the  charming  little  melody — "  Kate  of 
Garnavilla  " — in  Irish  and  in  English,  to- 
gether with  the  music  ;  the  music  and  the 
English  metrical  version  we  owe  to  the 
kindness  of  a  friend.  These  versions  have 
the  rare  merit  that  it  is  hard  to  decide 
which  is  the  original ;  at  all  events,  the  two 
versions  must  be  the  composition  of  one  and 
the  same  author,  f'  Pleasant  Ned  Lysaght," 
a  native  of  the  County  of  Clare,  who  died 
in  Dublin  about  1810,  as  the  friend  alluded 
to  above  states. 

A  few  months  since  there  was  in  the 
Clonmel  Chronicle  a  notice  of  the  Rev. 
William  Archer  Butler,  Professor  of  Moral 
Philosophy,  T.C.Ü.,  containing  the  follow- 
ing passage  : — "  William  Archer  Butler  was 
born  about  1814,  at  Annerville,  not  far  from 
Clonmel.  While  he  was  still  a  very  young 
child,  his  parents  removed  to  Garnavilla, 
near  Cahir,  a  lovely  spot  on  the  banks  of 
the  Suir,  to  which  Ned  Lysaght's  song  of 
"  Lovely  Kate  of  Garnavilla,"  has  given 
more  than  local  celebrity.  "  Lovely  Kate" 
was  probably  Butler's  aunt,  and  was  cer- 
tainly one  of  the  belles  of  Tipperary.  Just 
adjoining  Garnavilla  lay  the  demesne  ol  the 
Butlers,  Lords  of  Cahir,  one  of  the  most 
extensive  and   most   picturesque  parks    in 

Ireland Through  this  park  the 

Suir  flows  for  two  or  three  miles  before 
reaching  Garnavilla,  winding  its  way  lazily,

mostly  through  verdant  glades,  now  and 
again  under  the  shadow  of  overhanging 
groves.  The  hills  and  rising  grounds  are 
everywhere  crowned  with  ancient  timber, 
and  almost  at  every  side  in  the  distance 
noble  ranges  of  mountains  meet  the  eye." 

The  homestead  of  Garnavilla  is  still  occu- 
pied by  Miss  Helen  C.  Archer  Butler,  sister 
of  the  Rev.  William  A.  Butler,  and  I  believe 
the  only  surviving  member  of  that  popular 
family.  Upon  this  branch  of  the  Butlers 
the  mantle  of  "  Kate  of  Garnavilla  "  appears 
to  have  descended.  "  The  late  James  A. 
Butler  was  long  looked  upon  as  the  finest 
man  in  Tipperary,  and  the  other  members 
of  the  family  were  all  remarkably  hand- 
some." The  family  name  of  "  Lovely  Kate  " 
was  Nagle,  and  her  daughter  is  the  wife  of 
Captain  W.  Palliser,  R.N.,  of  Coole  Abbey, 
Knocklofty,  near  Clonmel. 

There  is  "  one  sad  recollection"  awakened 
by  this  melody  :  the  thought  that  the  writer 
of  these  two  versions  should  not  have  left 
us  something  more  in  his  native  tongue. 
The  writer  of  "  Kate  of  Garnavilla  "  had 
certainly  poetical  powers  of  no  ordinary 
kind  ;  but  like  so  many  other  Irishmen,  he 
allowed  them  to  lie  fallow. 


KATE  OF  GARNAVILLA. 
By  Edward  Lysaght. 


Have  you  been  at  Garnavilla? 
Have  you  seen  at  Garnavilla, 
Beauty's  train  trip  o'er  the  plain 

With  lovely  Kate  of  Garnavilla  ? 
Oh  !  she's  pure  as  virgin  snows, 
Ere  they  light  on  woodland  hill-0  ; 
Sweet  as  dew-drop  on  wild  rose 

Is  lovely  Kate  of  Garnavilla. 

Chorus — Have  you  been,  &c.

To  thy  sweet  lay  nigh  weeping  willow  ; 
But  oh  !  the  strains  more  sweet,  more  soft, 
That  flows  from  Kate  of  Garnavilla. 
Chorus. 


And  as  a  noble  ship  I've  seen 
A-sailing  o'er  the  swelling  billow, 
So  I've  marked  the  graceful  mien 
Of  lovely  Kate  of  Garnavilla. 

Chorus. 


If  poet's  prayers  can  banish  cares, 
No  cares  shall  come  to  Garnavilla  ; 
Joy's  bright  rays  shall  gild  her  days, 

And  dove-like  peace  perch  on  her  pillow. 
Charming  maid  of  Garnavilla, 
Lovely  maid  of  Garnavilla  ; 
Beauty,  grace  and  virtue  wait 

On  lovely  Kate  of  Garnavilla.

KATE   OF    GARNAVILLA. 


Were  you  ever  in  Garnavilla  ; 
Or  have  you  seen  in  Garnavilla 

The  pleasant  young  woman 
Of  the  locks  of  gold  ? 
It  is  Kate,  my  darling,  in  Garnavilla. 

Chorus — Were  you  ever  in  Gar- 
navilla, &c. 


More  fair  is  she  than  a  swan  on  a  lake, 
And  than  snow  on  the  top  of  the  round 
bush ; 

And  sweeter  is  her  kiss 

Than  the  dew  on  a  rose, 
It  is  Kate,  my  darling,  in  Garnavilla. 

Were  you  ever  in  Garnavilla,  &c. 


Sweeter  is  her  voice  than  the  blackbird  or 

the  thrush, 
And  than  the  nightingale  on  the  branch  of 
the  sallow ; 

Like  a  ship  under  sail, 
On  a  sea  without  fog, 
It  is  thus  I  see  my  darling  in  Garnavilla. 
And  were  you  ever  in  Garnavilla,  &c. 


To  Thee,  O  Christ,  I  send  my  prayer, 
If  there  be  any  efficacy  in  a  prayer  from 
the  poet ; 

Without  tribute,  without  rent, 
Without  affliction,  without  want, 
May    Kate    and    her   companions   be   in 
Garnavilla. 

And  were  you  ever  in  Garnavilla,  &c.

NOTES. 

poile<ini)iAC  =  oii\eAmnac,  fitting  ;  also  yeiLce^c. 
From  jroilim  =  oiriim,  jrogiiAini,  I  suit,  fit. 

Uiol  cpuAtge,  an  object  of  pity.  t)iol  =  equivalent, 
hence,  (a)  proper  proportion,  share  ;  (l>)  proper  treat- 
ment ;  (c)  meed,  object  of. 

t)ubflán,  also  fb<iri  =  defiance. 

1  rroáil  te  =  i  115^  ẅó,  1  ngoi^eacc  x>ó,  lie,  near. 
The  phrase  most  often  heard  in  \Vest  Connaught. 

Cdtimic,  a  patch  of  rich  pasture,  a  thing  very  rarely 
found  in  Arann. 

Con^báil,  keeping.  In  the  spoken  language,  this  verb 
is  used  as  if  it  were  coinnijjim,  infill.  comneÁil.  In 
places  the  imperative  used  is  commrii. 

1  beŵbŵ  =  instead  of.     Cp.  English  "  in  the  room  of." 

pufUipoA,  easy.  Usual  form  of  (rupu)';  in  Minister  yuipip. 

C<Mfbein,  show.    Usually  pronounced  fpAW  in  Arann  ; 

pÁm  is  sometimes  heard  in  Munster. 

DuL  1  léij;  =  T>ul  1  mu-ÒA,  going  to  ruin. 

Aic  =  Aii~oeAC,  also  =  m<Mc.  In  Munster  this  second 
meaning  is  not  attached  to  the  word,  so  that  b'<sic  bom 
=  ba  ma\i  tioni  in  Connaught,  would  mean  in  Munster, 
"  I  thought  it  strange."

,,  101,  col.  2. — Chotinaicfor  comiii|\c.  I  never  heard 
this  latter  form  anywhere,  although 
it  is  that  used,  almost  exclusively,  in 
books  and  MSS.
