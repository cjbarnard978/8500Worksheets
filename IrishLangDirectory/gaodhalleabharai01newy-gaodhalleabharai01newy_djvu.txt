At  the  meeting  of  the  National  League,  in 
Tuam,  the  other  day  the  language  was  referred  to 
thus— 

The  meeting  was  about  to  disperee  when 
Mr.  Lyons  said  the  National  League  should  do 
something  towards  the  preservation  and  cultivat- 
ion of  the  Irish  language.  He  would  suggest  that 
this  branch  of  the  League  take  the  matter  up  and 
collect  subscriptions  for  the  purpose.  Distributing 
prizes  in  the  schools  of  the  parish,  to  pupils  learn 
ing  Irish,  would  be  a  good  way  to  encourage  the 
etudy  of  the  language. 

The  Kev.  President  paid  there  was  a  column  of 
Irish  given  weekly  in  the  Tuam  Ne^cs,  and  very 
few  read  it. 

Mr.  Lyons — I  am  not  certain  whether  that  is 
so  or  not,  but  I  would  set  little  value  on  the  pat- 
riotism of  the  Irishman  who  would  not  help  to  pre 
serve  his  native  language.  Our  language  was  the 
chief  means  under  Providence,  of  preserving  the 
Catholic  faith  in  this  country  in  the  penal  times. 

The  Rev.  President,  Father  Canton,  said  that 
every  person  sitting  around  the  room  here  had 
plenty  of  Irish, 

Mr.  Flatley— But  what  about  the  rising  genera- 
tion? 

Rev.  President— It  is  the  Literary  Society  that 
onght  to  take  up  the  matter,  there  is  plenty  of  ma- 
terial for  the  purpose.  You  can  hardly  expect  old 
people  to  do  it  and  I  would  suggest  that  Mr.  Lyon 
think  over  the  matter  till  next  meeting  when 
something  practical  might  be  proposed. 
The  meeting  then  adjourned  to  1st  Sept. 

— 2  uam  IHews. 
With  few  exceptions  the  laity  seem  to  take  great 
er  interest  in  the  preservation  of  the  language  than 
the  clergy,  when  it  is  the  special  duty  of  the  lat 
ter.  The  Irish- American  element  in  this  country 
cannot  be  less  than  twenty  millions,  yet  the  Gath 
olic  population,  including  all  nationalities,  is  giv 
en  at  seven  or  eight  millions  only.  Nine  tenths  of 
the  Irish  who  came  to  this  country  were  Catholics, 
and,  therefore,  under  ordinary  circumstances,  nine 
tenths  of  th«  Irish  American  element  should  be 
Catholics,  but  they  are  not,  owing  to  the  neglect 
to  cultivate  and  preserve  the  language  and  litera 
ture  of  their  country.  An  Irish  name  is  no  longer 
»n  indication  of  a  man's  religion  in  this  country, 
The  children  of  Irish  parents  who  have  amassed 
money  in  this  country  are  no  longer  Irish  in  either 
sentiment  or  religion.  Why?  Because  Irishism 
is  to  them  the  synonym  of  ignorance  and  scorn  to 
to  be  identified  with  it.  Show  such  people  that 
the  Irish  did  have  a  language  and  a  literature  and 
there  will  be  little  detection.  Hence,  the  Irish 
Catholic  bishop  or  priest  who  makes  no  efifort  to 
cultivate  and  preserve  the  language  is  playing  into 
the  hands  of  protestantism  and  infidelity.  If 
Father  Canton,  or  any  other  priest  takes  exception 
to  the  above,  let  him  account  for  the  Irish-Amer 
ican  defection  to  Catholicity,  and  the  fact  that  very 
few  of  the  Irish  American  poor  are  protest  ants. 
Mr.  Lyons  struck  the  nail  square  on  the  head  : 
it  would  take  Lord  Ross's  telescope  to  discover 
the  patriotism  of  him  who  neglects  his  language. ) 
The  workers  in  the  Gaelic  cause  need  not  be  sur 
prised  to  see  The  Gael  weekly,  as  the  representa 
tive  of  the  Gaelic  Race,  in  the  near  future.  It  is 
easier  to  run»  weekly  than  a  monthly  paper. 

We  have  for  lO'ne  time  interesting  Gaelic  ma* 
ter  from  Mr.  Htnebry,  a  student  of  Maynooth, 
fFbioh  W6  fiball  vcB^aence  in  pur  nest  jesue. 


Balfour's  latest  scheme  to  denationalize  Ireland 

the  endowing  of  a  Catholic  university. 

The  only  way  tf>  conserve  Irish  Nationality  is  to 
cultivate  and  preserve  the  language,  and  the  best 
way  to  do  that  is  to  circulate  GaeUc  literature. 

We,  then,  beseech  the  readers  of  The  Gael  to 
do  the  latter.  This  can  be  effectually  done  in  this 
way.— 

Let  each  reader  make  a  list  of  all  the  Irishmen 
and  women  in  his  or  her  neighborhood  and  col- 
lect from  them  the  sum  of  one  penny  a  week  or 
5  cents  amonth,  as  sxtbscription  to  The  Gael,  the 
Irish  Echo,  or  the  Gaelic  journd,  whichever  the 
subscriber  elects  (We  mention  the  three  journals 
lest  objections  should  be  made  to  The  Gaei  ,  and' 
because  we  have  no  private  ends  in  view  apart 
from  the  circulation  of  Gaelic  literature.  )  Send 
the  names  to  the  oíí'ce  of  the  paper  selected,  that 
papers  may  be  sent,  and  the  subscriptions  whea 
they  amount  to  a  dollar  or  two,  deducting  all  the 
expenses  of  stationery,  postage  etc. 

If  this  be  tried  we  shall  pledge  our  life  for  a 
happy  result.  The  sum  of  a  penny  or  5  cents  is 
so  small  that  no  one  would  refuse  to  give  it,  if 
only  to  get  shut  of  the  collector'^  importunity. 

Of  course,  this  would  entail  considerable  labor 
but  labor  in  behalf  of  the  preservation  of  the  life 
of  his  nation  should  be  a  labor  of  love  to  every 
Irishman,  and  there  is  no  doubt  of  the  effective- 
ness of  the  mode  suggested 

To  protect  collectors,  all  subscribers  will  be  no- 
ted under 

Sentiments  of  our  Sob^cribers, 


The  readers  of  The  Gael    will    be  pleased  to 
learn  that  our  former  student  contributors, — 
M.  P.  Mahoo,  Mt  St  Mary's  College,  Md. 
P.  C.  York,  St  Mary's  Seminary,  Bal  Md. 
P.  H.    0*l.»onnell,   Villanova    College,  Pa.    and 
D.  J.  Murphy,  St  Charles's  Seminary,    Pa.    are 
now  in  Holy  Orders.      We  pray  that  their  mis- 
sions may  be  prosperous  and  happy. 

Their  more  extended  intercourse  with  the  pub 
lie  now  will  increase  their  opportunities  to  prop 
agate  the  language.  And  we  hope  tliey  will  get 
some  of  their  respective  neighbors  to  start  the  5 
cent  subscriptions,  as.  above  recommended.

price  is  fifty  cents  a  year.

SECOND    BOOK  (Continued.) 

Exercise  III  d. 

D  broad  sounds  somewhat  like  gh 
soft,  or  y  broad  and  guttural,  as,  -j-AOti- 
•cujTje,  a  freeman. 

D  slender  sounds  exactly  like  y  in 
year,  río]i-tíl]r,  sincere. 

t>  filial  is  silent. 

D  in  the  body  of  a  word,  not  a  com. 
pound,  is  silent. 

D  in  such  words  as  buj-óe  and  c|io)te 
merely  lengthens  the  sound  of  the  pie. 
ceding  letters,  and  preserves  the  cor- 
rect orthogri*phy,  somewhat  like  gh  in 
mi[gh]ty,  thou[gh],  etc.  in  English 

D  in  the  first  syllable  of  a  word,  if 
preceded  by  a  or  o,  sounds  like  i  in 
vie,  ey  m  eye.  The  exceptions  to  this 
rule  are  marked  with  accent,  thus,  á-ó, 
luck,  pronounced,  aw.  But  when  the  a 
or  the  o  is  a  member  of  a  dipthong  it 
does  not  come  under  the  rule. 

Note— The  foregoing  rules  are  so  im- 
portant that  the  student  should  commit 
them  to  memory.

THE  KID  .\ND  THE  WOLF. 

A  KID  that  had  strayed  from  the  herd  was  purfued 
by  a  Wolf.  When  she  saw  all  other  hope  of  escape 
cut  off,  she  turned  round  to  the  Wolf,  and  said,  ''I 
must  allow  indeed  that  I  am  your  victim,  but  as 
my  life  now  is  but  short,  let  it  be  a  merry  one.  Do 
you  pipe  for  a  while,  and  I  will  dance."  While  the 
Wolf  was  piping  and  the  Kid  was  dancing,  the 
Dogs  hearing  the  music  ran  up  to  see  what  was 
going  on,  and  the  WoK  was  glad  to  take  himsel. 
off  as  fast  as  his  legs  would  carry  him. 

He  who  steps  out  of  his  way  to  play  the  fool,  must

THE  BOTS  AND  THE  FEOGS. 

A  troop  of  Boys  were  playing  at  the  edge  of  a  pond 
when,  perceiving  a  number  of  Frogs  in  the  water, 
they  began  to  pelt  at  them  with  stones.  They  had 
already  killed  many  of  the  poor  creatures,  when 
one  more  hardy  thanthe  rest  putting  his  head  above 
the  water,  said  to  them  ;  "Stop  your  cruel  sport, 
my  lads,  consider,  what  is  Play  to  you  is  Death  to 


"THE  PIOUS  WORK  OF  RIMINI." 

,  Amongst  other  spiritual  advantages  to  be  oh 
taine(?  from  the  ''Pious  WorV,''  in  which  Pope 
Leo  XIII.  takes  special  interest.  There  are  five 
Masses  celebrated  daily  for  the  intentions  of  the 
members,  with  Rosaries  and  Benediction  of  the 
Blessed  Sacrament  in  perpetuity.  By  request  of 
one  of  the  Brooklyn  members,  Mr.  David  O'- 
Keeflfe  has  translated  the  prayer,  to  be  said  daily, 
by  members  of  the  "Pious  Work,"  into  Gaelio, 
which  we  now  publish,  with  a  translation.  Tl  e 
Devotion  has  been  fully  explained  by  Miss  Casey, 
in  the  Dublin  papers.

Pope  Leo  has  placed  in  this  m:st  potent  weaoon. 
I  pray  you  to  grant  to  the  Sovereign  Pontiff  all 
the  graces  which  his  heait,  full  of  charity  for  all, 
expects,  of  you  ;  also  to  rekindle  in  the  heart  of 
all  Christians,  that  holy  zeal  with  which,  of  oLV

Scottish  Gaels. 

By  the  last  Cenau  s  the  united  population  of  the 
coanties  of  Ivernesa,  Boas  and  Cromarty,  Argyle 
ani  Suthertand,  Scotland,  was  2-38,993,  of  whom 
134,105  were  Gaelic  8peaker8,and  40,352  are  class- 
ed as  Oaelio  speakers  in  the  oonQties  of  Bate,  CJaith 
aes3,  Edinburgh,  Lanark,  Perth  aad  Renfrew.  As 
may  be  seen  above,  more  than  onehalf  of  the  popa- 
latioN  of  thefoar  árst  mentionedcounties  areUaelic 
speakers. 

His  Grace,  the  Duke  of  Athol,  Blair  Castle,  gives 
premiums  to  the  best  Gaelic  speakers  among  his 
tenantry,— we  never  hear  oi  Irish  nobelmen  toen- 
c  '>urage  the  preservation  of  the  ancient  langaage 
of  tbftir  country. 

It  was  at  Glencoe  in  this  coanty  that  the  trib» 
nt  MacDonald  was  massacred  in  1691,  by  the  ruf- 
fian soldiery  of  William  III.  who  were  instructed, 
-Not  to  trouble  themselve  with  prisoners." 

Father  Growney,  of  the  Gaelic  Union,  sent  u» 
his  translation  of  "God  Save  Ireland,"  but,  some 
«ray.  it  was  mislaid,  but  we  expect  it  will  twa  up 
soon.

We  take  great  pleasure  in  transferring  to  the 
colnmns  of  the  Gael,  from  our  respected  and  val 
uable  co-laborer,  the  Boston  Irish  Echo,  the  fol 
lowing  able  poem  by  our  friend  and  neighbor, 
Capt,  Norris,  Incidentally  we  avail  ourselves  of 
the  occasion  to  thank  the  Irish  Echo  for  its  flatter- 
ing reference  to  the  Gael  in  a  late  issue.  This  is 
as  it  should  be,  for  it  is  the  duty  of  all  who  sin- 
cerely desire  the  spread  of  the  language  to  bring 
the  channels  through  which  it  is  being  propagat- 
ed prominently  before  the  public — it  is  the  duty  of 
all  Irishoien.  We  are  glad  to  see  by  the  general 
"make-up"  of  the  Irish  Echo  that  it  is  financially 
prosperous.  We  sincerely  wish  it  the  greatest  pos 
sible  success.  Let  aU  our  friends  send  for  a 
copy  — Try  it  friends,  it  is  learnedly  conducted.

Pi.  F.,  Memphis,  Tenn, — We  have  nevtr  belong- 
ed to  the  dynamite  party.  We  know  Rosea,  and, 
though  not  agreeing  with  him  in  certain  points,  we 
believe  him  to  be  an  honest,  guileless  man.  We 
do  not  know  John  Devoy,  2d — We  believe  the 
Irish  Worid  has  done  more  to  elevate  the  Irish 
race,  at  home  and  abroad,  than  all  the  other  agen- 
cies combinfd.  The  venomous  darts  aimed 
at  it  and  its  editor  by  the  English  interest  at  home 
and  here,  is  a  sufSjient  proof  of  its  eifectivenesa. 
The  Hon.  Judge  Rooney,  a  patriot  of  patriots,  said 
to  US  the  other  day,  "It  is  a  pity  every  Irishman  in 
America  does  not  read  the  Irish  World."  It  was 
through  the  Irish  World  the  Irish  language  move- 
ment was  organized. 

The  readers  of  the  Irish  World  cannot  but  be 
enlightened,  for,  apart  from  politics,  it  is  in  itself 
an  encyclopedia  of  general  knowledge.

ENGLAND'S  FINE  WORK. 

It  is  plain  to  the  dullest 
hension  that  some  of  the 
tions  of  the  Clan-na-Gaels  are  in  the 
British  service.  England's  object  is  to 
break  up  and  disorganize  that  power- 
ful patriotic  society. 

Those  who  have  watched  the  prog- 
ress ot  events  in  the  public  press  can- 
not fail  to  form  a  tolerably  correct  i- 
dea  of  who  the  British  agents  are — 
The  two  men  who  made  the   ball,  and 


set   it   in   motion,  and  then  slunk  be- 
hind the  ditch  themselves. 

The  executive  officers  of  a  secret  so- 
ciety who  are  the  custodians  of  a  con- 
siderable amount  of  money  are  placed 
in  a  painful  position  from  the  fact  that 


such  secrecy  bars  them  from  defending 
themselves  against  the  tongue  of  envy, 
malice  or  self-interest. 

The  revelations  of  the  i^ronin  trag- 
edy show  that  two  men  made  charges 
of  mal  .feasance  against  a  former  exec- 
utive body ;  that  the  man  who  made 
the  major  charges  declined  to  go  for- 
ward to  prove  them  ;  that  the  man  who 
made  the  minor  charges  did  go  for- 
ward, and  failed  to  prove  his  charges, 
and  therefore,  that  there  were  no  char- 
ges prr>ven. 

Now,  the  man  who  made  the  major 
charges,  serious  charges,  and  who  refus- 
ed to  appear  before  the  investigating, 
tribunal  to  prove  them  ;  and  who  there 
after  repeated  the  charges  in  substance 
in  the  public  press,  stands  in  a  very  pe- . 
culiar  light  before  an  enlightened  pub- 
lic— He  stands  a  self-confessed  moral 
assassin,  whose  company  should  be 
shunned  by  honest  men. 

A  Philadelphia  "patriot"  issued  a 
lot  of  circulars  in  relation  to  the  Cro- 
nin  murder,  even  before  the  body  was 
found  !  How  did  he  know  that  Cronin 
was  murdered  before  the  body  was 
found  ?  and  who  paid  him  tor  the  cost 
of  the  circulars,  which  must  have  been 
considerable  '1  Again,  who  pays  for  the 
tons  of  printed  matter  in  relation  to 
the  Cronin  tragedy,  and  inimical  to 
the  Sullivan,  so-called,  faction,  which 
is  being  mailed  to  Irishmen  from 
Maine  to  California? 

We  have  resided  in  this  city  nine- 
teen years,  yet  we  do  not  know  one 
member  (barring  O'M.  Condon  )  of  the 
warring  Clans.  Therefore  what  we  say 
in  relation  to  them  proceeds  from  a 
sincere  desire  to  baffle  the  intrigues  of 
the  English  spy.  It  would  be  humili- 
ating to  the  intelligence  of  the  Irish 
race  were  the  English  able  to  disorg- 
anize their  patriotic  societies  by  supe- 
rior, though  diabolical,  political  tactics.. 
Let  the  rank  and  file  of  the  Clans  ex- 
pel the  warriors,  and  reorganize,  tak' 
in^  care,  for  the  future,  that  the  treas- 
urer of  their  funds  shall  be  known  to 
all  the  members. 

The  treasurer  being  known  to    alt

the  members,  will  cause  the  selection 
of  a  proper  man^  to  whom  the  insidious 
whisper  of  the  traitor  can  do  no  injury, 
nor,  through  him,  to  the  organization. 

(Contiaued  from  page  890) 

And  again  on  page  39,    "2t)ATi  b'ATjAni 

AT)  IÁ  CUAjt  CATIC,  TIAC  flACAti  'SO)^^}T  í)0 

ceAc  ATI  c-rA5AiTic,"  ctc.  We  candidly 
admit  that  we  can  see  no  difference  in 
tlie  "case"  of  ceAc  in  the  above  three 
instances,  and  that  we  have  never  seen 
an  instance  in  which  the  choice  of  a 
preposition  could  change  the  "case''  of 
a  noun.  Professor  O'Duffy  in  defining 
cutT]  says,  "It  governs  the  genitive 
case."  But  suppose  cutti  to  be  employ- 
ed out  of  place,  is  it  reasonable  to  sup- 
pose that  the  case  of  the  noun  should 
be  thereby  affected  ? 

The  proper  definition  of  cuTtj  is  this, 
CuTti  is  a  compound  preposition,  and  is 
generally  placed  before  nouns  in  the 
genitive  case —  not  that  it  governs  that 
case,  for  it  is  not  in  the  power  of  any 
preposition  to  change  the  case  of  the 
noun.  And  we  would  respectfully  di- 
rect the  attention  of  CjiaojI)]' r)  and  Pro- 
fessor O'Duffy  to  that  fact.  Also,  in 
the  part  of  the  country  where  we  were 
raised  ii^ib  is  not  used  in  the  above 
S3nse—  we  say  ^lAb,  was;  neither  do  we 
•say  cAOit)—  we  say  cAob,  as,  o  cAOb  50 
XAol).  It  is  so  used  by  O'Reilly,  though 
he  marks  its  gender  as  feminine.  But 
the  LeAbATi  SseuUj^eAccA  is  the  best 
Gaelic  production  we  have  yet  seen. 
And  the  compiler  rightly  dedicates  it 
"to  the  Rev.  Euseby  D.  Cleaver  in  the

The  book  should  be  in  the  hands  of 
every  Irish  reader  and  Gaelic  student. 
It  contains  copious  notes  which  are  in- 
valuable to  the  student.      The  price  of 


21N  5210D21t. 


the  book  is  5s. 

We  have  several  of  the  stories  in 
manuscript  already  from  Mr.  Blake, 
and  we  shall  publish  them  from  time 
to  time  as  soon  as  opportunity  offers,  i. 
e ,  as  soon  as  we  can  add  to  our  stock 
of  Gaelic  type. 

As  may  be  seen  by  the  foregoing 
dedication,  the  Rev.  Mr.  Cleaver  has 
paid  the  expense  of  publishing  this 
Gaelic  story  book.  We  have  a  large 
number  of  rich  Irishmen  in  America, 
How  many  of  them  are  coming  for- 
ward to  help  to  preserve  the  language 
of  their  forefathers?  Apart  Irom  sup- 
porting those  journals  which  publish 
the  language,  there  are  many  other 
ways  in  which  patriotic  Irishmen  could 
illumine  the  pages  of  history  in  conn- 
ection with  the  language.  A  cheap 
Irish- English  and  English-Irish  dict- 
ionary is  a  necessity.  Is  there  an  Irish- 
man or  woman  in  America  who  will 
undertake  its  production  7  O'Donovan 
and  O'Curry  were  comparatively  poor 
men  in  their  time,  but  their  memories 
will  continue  to  shine  in  the  pages  of 
history  when  their  millionaire  country- 
men will  be  forgotten.  We  appeal 
then,  to  our  well-to-do  countrymen  to 
build  a  monument  for  themselves  in 
Gaelic  literature  which  shall  live  for- 
ever. 

A  Note  by  the  Author. 

It  seems  ridicnlons  that  we  cannot  publish  a 
book  in  our  own  language  without  introducing 
more  or  less  of  English  into  it.  I  had  determined 
to  publish  these  stories  just  as  they  are,  without 
any  commentary,  such  seeming  to  me  unneces- 
sary :  but  certain  friends  pointed  out  to  me  the 
advisability  of  adding  some  explanatory  observa- 
tions on  the  text,  which  should  prove  useful  to 
any  who  may  use  this  book  to  learn  Irish. 

I  accordingly  write— reluctantly  enough— this 
and  the  following  notes  in  English,  seeing  that 
dome  learners  may  find  them  useful ;  and  as  people 
are  always  asking,  "What  ia  the  good  of  keeping 
up  the  language  at  all?"  I  determined  that  this 
iirst  note  should  be  a  short  answer  to  the  ques- 
tion. 

Perhaps  I  cannot  do  better  than  reproduce  here 
part  of  an  answer  already,  published  elsewhere, 
when  those  who  wished  to  preserve  our  language 
were  accused  by  an  Irish  magazine  of  aimlessness 
iind  foolishness.    I  then  said  — 


"If  we  allow  our  living  language  to  die  out,  it 
is  almost  certain  that  we  condemn  our  literary  re- 
cords to  remain  in  obscurity.  All  our  great  schol- 
ars, nearly  all  those  who  have  done  anythinti  for 
the  elucidation  of  our  MSS.— O'Connor  of  Ballin- 
agar,  O'Donovan,  O'Curry,  Petrie,  Hennessy-all 
these  spoke  the  language  naturally  from  their  cra- 
dle, and  had  it  not  been  so  they  would  never  have 
been  able  to  accomplish  the  work  they  did,  a 
wcrk  which  first  made  it  possible  for  a  JubianvUle 
or  a  Windiech  to  prosecute  their  Celtic  studies  with 
any  success. 

"There  is  no  use  in  arguing  the  advantage  of 
making  Irish  the  language  of  our  newspapers  and 
clubs,  because  that  is  and  ever  will  be  an  impossi- 
bility ;  but  for  several  reasons  we  wish  to  arrest 
the  language  in  its  downward  path,  and  if  we  can- 
not spread  it  (as  I  do  not  believe  we  very  much 
can),  we  will  at  least  prevent  it  from  dying  out, 
and  make  sure  that  those  who  speak  it  now  shall 
also  transmit  it  unmodified  to  their  dosscend- 
ants 

"To  be  told  that  the  language  which  1  spoke 
from  my  cradle,  the  language  of  my  father  and 
grandfather,  and  all  my  ancesters  in  an  unbroken 
line  leading  up  into  the  remote  twilight  of  antiqu- 
ity, have  spoken ;  the  language  which  has  en- 
twined itself  with  every  fibre  of  my  being,  helped 
to  mould  my  habits  of  conduct  and  forms  of 
thought ;  to  be  calmly  told  by  an  Irish  journal 
that  the  sooner  I  'leave  it  to  the  universities'  the 
better;  that  we  will  improve  our  Eajlish  speak- 
ing by  giving  up  our  Irish  ;  to  be  told  this  by  a  re- 
presentative Irish  journal  is  naturally  and  justly 
painful. 

"I  do  not  think  the  Saxon  language  has  greater 
claims  upon  the  western  peasantry,  or  on  myself, 
than  the  Irish  language  has,  or  that  wa  should  be 
told  to  give  up  the  tongue  of  oar  fathers  that  we 
may  better  speak  the  language  of  strangers.  .    . 

"I  cannot  conceive  a  more  acute  pain  in  the 
power  of  sentiment  to  inflict  than  that  which  I 
should  feel  if.  after  a  life  passed  in  England,  or 
America,  or  the  Colonies,  I  were  to  come  back  to 
my  native  mountains  and  fi  ad  that  the  indifference 
or  the  actual  discouragement  of  our  leaders  had 
succeeded  in  destroying  the  language  of  my  child- 
hood, and  with  it  the  tales,  the  traditions,  the  le- 
gends, the  imaginations  with  which  my  cradle  had 
been  surrounded. 

"I  do  not  think  it  would  be  for  the  advantage 
of  our  race  to  let  the  language  die.  I  affirm  with- 
out hesitation  that  those  who  continue  to  speak 
their  own  language  are  in  every  way  the  intellect- 
ual and  generally  the  moral,  superiors  of  those 
who  have  allowed  it  to  die  out.  When  a  locality 
has  allowed  Irish  to  die  out  the  people  Use  nearly 
all  those  distinctive  characteristics  which  make 
them  so  lovable  and  so  courteous.  I  have  verifi- 
ed this  over  and  over  again,  and  feel  sure  I  am

asserting  the  truth.  The  reason  of  it  is  transpar- 
ently obvious.  When  they  lose  the  language  they 
lose  also  the  traditional  unwritten  literature 
which,  inculcating  and  eulogising  what  is  court- 
teous,  high-minded,  and  noble,  supplied  coutinu. 
ously  an  incentive  to  the  practice  of  those  qual- 
ities  

"Wherever  Irish  is  the  vernacular  of  the  people 
there  live  enshrined  in  it  memories  and  imagin- 
ations, deeds  of  daring,  and  tragic  catastrophes,  an 
heroic  cycle  of  legend  and  poem,  a  vast  and  varied 
etore  of  apothegms,  sententious  proverbs  and 
weighty  sentences,  which  contain  the  very  best 
and  truest  thoughts,  not  of  the  rude  forefathers  of 
the  hamlet,  but  of  the  kings,  sages,  bards,  and 
ehanachies  of  bygone  ages.  Such  a  stream  of 
collected  thought  as  is  everywhere  found  where 
the  Irish  language  remains  spoken  must  exercise 
an  influence  on  those  who  come  into  contact  with 
it,  and  such  an  influence  must  be  an  advantageous 

one 

"If  by  ceasing  to  speak  Irish  our  peasantry 
could  learn  to  appreciate  Shakespeare  and  Milton 
to  study  Wordsworth  and  Tennyson,  then,  indeed, 
we  might  let  it  go  without  any  very  acute  pang- 
But  this  is  not  the  case.  We  lay  aside  a  language 
which  for  all  ordinary  purposes  of  eyeryday  life 
is  more  pointed  and  forcible  than  any  wjth  which 
I  am  acquainted,  and  we  replace  it  by  another 
which  we  learn  badly,  aad  speak  with  an  attro- 
cious  accent,  interlarding  it  with  b£.rbarsims  and 
vulgarity. 

"The  janguage  cf  the  western  Gael  is  the  lan- 
guage best  suited  to  his  surroundings,  it  corres- 
ponds best  to  his  topography,  his  nomenclature, 
his  organs  of  speech,  and  the  use  of  it  guarantees 
the  rem.  mbrance  of  his  own  wierd  and  beautiful 
traditions.  Around  the  blazing  bog-fire,  of  a 
winter's  night,  Dermod  O'Duibhne  of  the  Love 
Spot,  Finn  with  the  coat  of  hairy  skin,  Oonan  the 
Ihersites  of  the  Fenians,  the  old  blind  giant  Ess- 
heen  (Ossiau),  the  speckled  bull  with  the  movable 
horn,  the  enchanted  cat  of  Eathcrogan,  and  all  the 
other  wild  and  poetic  offspring  of  the  bardic  imag- 
ination pass  in  review  before  us.  Every  hill, 
every  /io.v,  tv-iy  crag  and  gnarled  tree,  and  lone- 
ly valley  has  its  own  strange  and  graceful  legend 
attached  to  it,  the  product  of  the  Hibernian  Celt 
in  its  tiueet  and  purest  type,  not  to  be  improved  on 
by  change,  and  of  infinitive  worth  in  moulding  thg 
race  type,  of  immesurable  value  in  forming  its 
character.  But  with  the  loss  of  the  Irish  language 
all  this  is  lost. 

"The  native  Irish  deal  iu  sententious  proverbs 
perhaps  more  than  any  other  nation  in  Europe  ; 
their  nperioire  of  apothegms,  is  enormous.  It  is 
a  characteiistic  which  is  lost  with  their  change  of 
language,  and,  cjnsequently,  has  not  been  obser- 
«d  cr  nctjced.    Let  their  language  die,  and  not 


one  of  their  proverbs  will  remain.  Of  the  hund- 
reds of  stereotyped  sayings  and  acute  aphorisms 
which  I  have  heard  aptly  introduced  upon  occas- 
ons  where  Irish  was  spoken,  I  cannot  say  that  I 
have  heerl  five  survive  in  an  English  dress  where 
the  language  has  been  lost.  And  if  this  is  the  case 
with  aphorisms  and  sayings,  much  more  does  it 
hold  good  of  the  songs,  the  legends,  and  the  he- 
roic cycle  of  stories.  I  believe,  for  example,  that 
the  character  of  the  people  is  no  longer  the  same 
in  the  east  of  the  county  Leitrim  and  in  the  coun- 
ty Longford,  where  Irish  died  out  a  generation  or 
two  ago.  There  Dermod  of  the  Love  Spot  is  un- 
known, Finn  Mac  Cool  is  barely  remembered  as  a 
'giant,'  Ossian  is  never  heard  of,  the  ancient  mem- 
ories have  ceased  to  cling  to  the  various  objects  of 
nature;  the  halo  of  romance,  the  exquisite  and. 
dreamy  film  which  hangs  over  the  Mayo  mount- 
ains has  been  blown  away  by  the  blast  of  the  most 
realistic  materialism  ;  and  the  people,  when  they 
gather  into  one  another's  houses  in  the  evening  for 
a  cai'ee  {ceilidhe—si  night  visit),  can  talk  of  noth- 
ing but  the  latest  scandal,  or  the  price  Tim  Eoon- 
ey  got  for  his  calf,  or  the  calving  of  Paddy  Swee- 
ny's cow 

"I  do  not  believe  iu  resuscitatinar  a  great  na- 
tional language  by  twopenny-halfpenny  boitnties. 
If  the  Irish  people  are  resolved  to  let  the  national 
language  die,  by  all  mea  is  let  tbem.  I  believe  the 
instinct  of  a  nation  is  of  ea  just  *r  than  that  of  any 
individital.  But  this,  at  least,  no  one  can  deny, 
that  hitherto  the  Irish  nation  ha^  had  no  choice  in 
the  matter.  What  between  tl  e  Anglo-Irish  gen- 
try, who  came  upon  ua  in  a  lljcd  after  the  confis- 
cations of  1648,  and  again  after  1691,  whose  great 
object  it  was  to  stamp  out  both  the  language  and 
institutions  of  the  nation,  with  th.-ir  bards' and 
shanachies,  ollamhs  and  proiessors;  and  with  the 
brutalized,  sensual,  unsympathetic  gentry  of  tht 
last  century,  the  racing,  blustering,  drunken  squir- 
eens, who  usurped  the  places  of  the  O'Connors, 
the  O'Briens,  the  O'DonneJls,  the  O'Cahans,  'he 
MacCarthys,  our  old  and  truly  cultured  nobility, 
who  cherished  hereditary  poets  and  historians : 
what  with  the  purblind,  cringing  pedagogues  of 
the  present  cenlnry,  whosj  habit  it  was  to  beat 
and  threaten  their  papih  fjr  talking  Irish:  what 
with  the  high-handed  action  of  the  authorities,, 
who,  with  cool  contempt  of  existing  circumstances, 
continued  to  appoint  English  speaking  magistra- 
tes, petty -sessions  clerks,  and  local  oííicials  among 
a  people  to  whom  they  could  not  make  themselves 
intelligible,  what  with  the  hostility  of  the  Board 
of  Education,  who  do  not  r(c"gmse  the  language 
of  those  baronies  where  no  English  is  spoken,  even 
to  the  extent  of  publishing  school  books  in  it,  what 
with  this,  and  our  long  slavery  as  a  nation,  we  as- 
sert that  the  Irish  language  has  had  no  chance  of 
showing  its  capabilities,  or  those  who  speak  it  of

''So  BtroEg  is  the  feeling  in  Arcerica  in  favour 
of  an  attempt  to  preserve,  what  many  people  there 
feel  to  be  the  purest  and  most  setluative  thing  that 
Irish  nationality  can  present  them  with,  that  even 
the  New  York  Herald,  the  leading  newspaper  of 
America,  opened  its  columns  the  other  day  to  a 
portion  of  a  speech  spoken  in  Irish  by  some  prom- 
inent patriot  in  New  York,  which  it  not  only  prin- 
ed  in  Irish  as  delivered,  but  also  in  the  native 
type.  Have  we  lived  to  see  it?  Are  they  less 
materialÍMtio  over  there  beyond  the  seas  than  we 
are  at  horn»:'  ?  Does  the  New  York  Hn-ald  act- 
ually do  for  us  what  V^iiied  Ireland  obstinately 
refuses  to  do? 

"There  is  just  one  other  objection  to  be  notic- 
ed. We  are  told  that  in  learning  English  we  are 
learning  a  superior  language  to  that  we  are  invit- 
«d  to  leave  off.  It  is  so,  but  unless  we  learn  it  in 
a  superior  way,  we  get  no  good  by  the  change. 
For  all  the  ordinary  purposes  of  everyday  peasant 
life,  I  believe  Irish  to  be  enormously  superior  to 
English— certainly  to  the  English  that  is  spoken 
in  Ireland 

"In  conchisioD,  we  may  say  this,  that  while 
our  social  and  commercial  relations  make  it  a 
necessi^^y  for  every  man,  woman  and  child,  in  this 
kingdom,  to  learn  English,  sooner  or  later,  rever- 
ence for  our  past  history,  regard  for  the  memory 
of  our  ancestors,  our  national  honour,  as  well  as 
the  fear  of  becoming  materialised  and  losing  our 
best  and  highest  characteristics,  call  upon  us  im 
peratively  to  assist  the  Irish  speaking  p'  pulation 
at  the  present  crisis,  and  to  establish  for  all  time 
bi-lingual  populatiou  in  those  parts  of  Ireland 
where  Irish  is  now  spoken,  from  which  all  those 
who,  in  the  distant  future,  may  wish  to  investigate 
the  history  or  the  antiquities  of  our  nation,  may 
draw,  as  from  a  fountain,  the  vernacular  linowl- 
edge  which  for  such  purpose,  is  indispensably 
ncccessary.'' 

I  do  not  think  there  is  ranch  to  add  to  what  I 
have  said  here,  except  to  observe  that  it  is  a  nat- 
ional duty — I  had  almost  said  a  moral  one — for  all 
those  who  speak  Irish  to  speak  it  to  their  children 
also,  and  to  take  care  that  the  grovring  generation 
shall  know  it  as  weJ  as  themselves,  and  on  all 
possible  occasions,  except  where  it  will  not  run. 
For,  if  we  allow  one  of  the  finest  and  richest  lan- 
guages in  Europe,  which,  fifty  years  ago  was  spok- 
en by  nearly  four  millions  of  Irishmen,  to  die  out 
without  a  struggle,  it  will  be  an  everlasting  dis- 
grace and  a  biting  stigma  upon  our  nationality. 

(Gaels.  Read  the  foregoing  Note  carefully  and 
endeavor  to  become  possessed  of  its  spirit.  Read 
it  also  for  your  Irish  friends,  and  then  ask  them 
to  contribute  one  penny  a  week  towards  the  cir- 
culation of  The  Gael,  which  has  done  so  much 
to  bring  about  what  the  patriotic  and  accomplish- 
ed Craoibhin  yearns  for.  Or  why  not  organize  soc 
ieties  for  tha  purpose  of  raising  funds  for  the  diá- 
tribution  of  prizes  among  the  children  learning 
Irish  in  the  schools  at  home,  as  suggested  by 
Mr.  Lyons,  of  the  Tuam  National  League  ?  Here

There  is  another  chronological  piece  of  curious 
interest  and  of  very  considerable  value,  which  was 
probably  composed  by  Flann,  or  at  least  that  por- 
tion of  it  which  precedes  A.  D.  1056,  the  year  of 
Flanu's  death.  It  comprises  a  list  of  the  reigns  of 
the  monarchs  of  Ireland,  with  those  of  the  con- 
temporary provincial  kings,  and  also  of  the  kings 
of  Scotland.  This  synchrouological  list  commen- 
ces with  Laeghaire,  who  succeeded  to  the  sover- 
eignty in  the  year  of  our  L  )rd  429,  and  it  is  car- 
ried down  to  the  death  of  Muircheartaoh  O'Brien, 
in  1119,  sixty- five  years  after  Flann's  death.  Who 
the  continuator  of  Flann  may  have  been  we  do 
not  now  know. 

It  may  be  interesting  to  give  the  following  ab- 
stract as  a  specimen  of  Flann's  synchronisms  of 
the  kings  of  Scotland,  as  it  shows  their  connection 
with  the  royal  lines  of  Erinn. 

It  was,  he  says,  in  the  year  49 S  that  Fergus 
Mor  and  his  brothers  went  into  Scotland:  They 
were  the  sons  of  Ere,  the  son  of  Eochaidh  Muin- 
reamhar,  whose  father  was  the  renowned  CoUa 
Uais,  who,  with  his  brothers,  overthrew  the  Ulster 
dynasty  and  destroyed  the  palace  of  Emania,  Muir- 
chertach  Mac  Eire,  one  ot  the  brothers,  was  the  an 
cestor  of  tbe  MacDonnells,  Lords  of  the  Isles,  and 
of  other  great  families  in  Scotland.  Our  tract  says 
that  from  the  battle  of  Ocha,  A.  D.  ;478,  to  the 
death  of  the  monarch,  Diarmuid,  son  of  Fergus 
Oerrbeoil,  there  was  a  space  of  eighty  years.  There 
were  four  monarchs  of  Erinn  within  that  time, 
namely,  Lughaidh,  son  of  Laeghaire,  Muiroher- 
tach,  son  of  Ere,  Tuathal  Mael  Qarbh,  and  Diar- 
muid. There  were  five  kings  of  Scotlnd  to  corr- 
espond with  these  four  of  Erinn,  namely  the  above 
Fergus  Mor,  his  brother  Aengus  Mor,  Domangort, 
the  son  of  Fergus,  Oomgrll,  the  sou  of  Domangort, 
and  Gabran,  the  son  of  Domangort. 

The  parallel  provincial  kings  of  Erinn  follow, 
but  it  is  not  necessary  to    enumerate  them  here. 

The  first  part  of  the  synchronisms  ascribed  ta 
Flann  is  lost  from  the  Book  of  Lecan,  but  it  is 
preserved  in  the  Book  of  Ballymote  (fol.  6  a.)  and 
as  for  as  can  be  judgod  from  their  tenor  iit  tbe  lat<

ter  book,  they  must  have  been  those  used  by  Tigh 
ernach,  or  they  maj  possibly  l.ave  been  taken  from 
an  earlier  work  which  was  common  both  to  Tigh- 
ernach  and  to  the  compiler  of  this  tract.  It  is,  in 
fact,  the  synchronism  of  Flann,  now  imperfect, 
which  we  find  at  the  commencement  of  Tigher- 
nach,  but  inserted  there  after  having  been  first 
subjected  to  the  critical  examination  and  careful 
balancing  of  authorities  which  generally  distin 
guish  that  learned  annalist. 

There  is  yet  another  important  chronological 
composition  in  existence;  to  which  I  must  here  al- 
lude, I  mean  the  Poem  of  Gilla  Caemhain,  who 
died  A.  D.  1072. 

The  writer  begins  by  stating  that  he  will  give 
the  annals  of  all  time,  from  the  beginning  of  the 
world  to  his  own  period.  He  computes  the  sever 
al  periods  from  the  Creation  to  the  Deluge,  from 
the  Deluge  to  Abraham,  from  Abraham  to  David, 
and  from  David  to  the  Babylonian  Captivity,  etc- 
From  the  Creation  to  the  incarnation  he  counts 
3952  years.  (This  is  obviously  the  common  He- 
brew Computation.)  He  then  goes  on  to  synch 
ronize  the  Eastesn  sovereigns  with  each  other,  and 
afterwards  with  the  Firbolgs  and  Tuatha  De  Da- 
nann  of  Erinn,  and  subsequently  with  the  Mile- 
sians. 

He  carries  down  the  computation  through  sevei- 
al  Eastern  and  Irish  dynasties,  giving  the  deaths  of 
all  the  monarchs,  and  of  several  of  the  provincial 
kings  of  Erinn,  as  wellap  of  many  remarkable  per 
sons,  such  as  the  death  of  Finn  Mac  Cumhaill,  of 
St.  Patrick,  and  of  St.  Brigid.  He  also  notices  the 
great  mortality  of  the  seventh  century,  the  drown- 
ing of  the  Danish  tyrant  Turgesius,  by  King  Mael- 
sechlainn  (or  Malachy),  etc.,  continuing  still  he 
gives  the  intervening  years,  down  to  the  death  of 
Rrian  Boroimhe,  in  1014,  and  io  on  to  the  "Sax- 
on" battle  in  which  the  king  of  the  Danes  was  kil- 
led, five  years  before  the  date  uf  the  composition 
of  his  poem. 

The  names  of  many  oth  erearly  writers  on  Irish 
history,  and  even,  in  some  instances,  fragments  oi 
their  works,  have  come  down  to  us,  but  the  two 
of  whose  compositions  I  have  given  the  foregoing 
brief  sketch,  are  in  many  respects  the  most  re- 
markable,

A  LITERARY  CURIOSITY. 


THE   CURSE    OF  O'KELLY. 


The  "curse  of  O'Kelly"  is  often  alluded  to,  yet 
yery  many,  we  think,  have  not  read  it.  Cormak 
O'Kelly,  the  celebrated  Irish  harper,  went  to  Don- 
eraile,  in  the  county  of  Cork,  where  his  watch  was 
piliered  from  his  fob.  This  so  aroused  hi»  ire  that 
he  celebrated  the  people  in  the  following  "string 
of  curses." 


Alas  !  how  dismal  is  my  tale  ; 
I  lost  my  watch  in  Doneraile— 
My  Dublin  watch,  my  chain  and  seal 
Pilfered  at  once  in  Doneraile. 
May  fire  and  brimstone  never  fail 
^        To  fall  in  shower  on  Doneraile, 

As  lightnings  flash  across  the  vale 
So  down  to  heU  with  Doneraile. 
Ihe  fat©  of  Pompeii »( Pbarsale 


Be  that  the  curse  of  Doneraile— 

May  beef  or  mutton,  lamb  or  veal 

Be  never  found  in  Doneraile. 

But  garlic  soup  and  skurvy  kale, 

Be  still  the  food  of  Doneraile— 

And  forward  as  the  creeping  snail 

Industry  be  at  Doneraile 

May  heaven  a  chosen  curse  entail 

On  ragged,  rotten  Doneraile 

May  sun  and  moon  forever  fail 

To  beam  their  light  on  Doneraile— 

May  every  pestilential  gale 

Blast  that  cursed  spot  called  Doneraile, 

May  no  sweet  cuckoo,  thrush  or  quail 

Be  ever  heard  in  Doneraile— 

May  patriots,  kings  and  commonweal 

Despise  and  harass  Djueraile, 

May  every  Post,  Gazette  and  Mail 

Sad  tidings  bring  to  Douerail— 

May  veangeance  fall  on  head  and  tail, 

From  north  to  south,  of  Doneraile. 

May  profit  small  and  tardy  sale 

Still  damp  the  sale  of  Doneraile, 

May  fame  resound  a  dismal  tale 

Whene'er  she  lights  on  Doneraile — 

May  Fgypts  plagues  at  once  prevail 

To  thin  the  knaves  at  Doneraile, 

May  frost  and  snow  and  sleet  and  hail 

Benumb  each  joint  in  Doneraile, 

May  wolves  and  blood-hounds  race  and  trail 

The  cursed  crew  of  Doneraile. 

May  Oscar  with  his  fiery  HaíI 

To  atoms  thrash  all  Doneraile— 

May  every  mischief  fresh  and  stale 

May  all  from  Belfast  to  Kinsale, 

Scoff,  curse  and  dam  you,  Doneraile, 

May  neither  fl  ur  nor  oatmeal 

Be  found  or  known  in  Donraile, 

May  want  and  woe  each  joy  curtail 

That  e'er  was  known  in  Doneraile. 

May  no  one  co£Sn  want  a  nail 

That  wraps  a  rogue  in  Doneraile— 

May  all  the  thieves  who  rob  and  steal. 

The  gallows  meet  in  Doneraile. 
May  all  the  sons  of  Granuweal 
Blush  at  the  thieves  at  Doneraile, 
May  mischief  big  as  a  Norway  whale 

O'erwhelm  the  knaves  of  Doneraile— 

May  curses  whole  and  by  retail 
Pour  with  full  force  on  Doneraile, 

May  every  transport  wont  to  sail 

A  convict  bring  from  Doneraile. 

May  every  churn  and  milking  pail 

Fall  dry  to  staves  in  Donerail. 

May  cold  and  hunger  still  congeal 

The  stagnant  blood  of  Doneraile— 
May  every  hour  new  woe  reveal 

That  hell  reserves  for  Doneraile, 

May  every  chosen  ill  prevail 

O'er  all  the  imps  at  Doneraile. 

May  th'  Inquisition  straight  impale 

The  rapparees  of  Doneraile. 

May  curses  of  Sodom  now  prevail 

And  sink  to  ashes  Doneraile — 

May  Charon's  boat  triumph  sail 

Completely  manned  from  Doneraile, 

Oh  !  may  my  couplet  never  fail 

To  find  new  curse  for  Doneraile ; 

And  may  Pluto's  inner  jail 

Forever  groan  with  Doneraile !

SERGEANT  JAMES  HICKEY. 
Death  of  a  Brave  American   Soldier  and  Devoted 
Irish  Patriot, 
(From  the    Irish  World  ví  Aug.  S) 


The  announcement  of  the  death  of  Sergeant  Jae. 
Hickey,  which  the  Irish  World  makes  this  week, 
will  cause  a  pang  of  regret  to  many  a  friend  who 
knew  and  admired  him  as  a  noble  specimen  of  true 
manhood.  Sergeant  Hickey  was  born  in  Barua, 
Co.  Qalway,  about  47  years  ago,  received  a  good 
education,  and  coming  to  America  settled  in  Boston. 
When  the  war  for  the  Union  broke  out,  he,  the  pic 
tnre  of  health  and  vigor,  joined  among  the  first  in 
volunteering  for  duty.  The  "Irish  Ninth"  was  form 
ed  and  he  entered  Company  A.  Capt.  James  F, 
McGunnigle  in  command.  No  man  in  that  famoas 
regiment  was  better  liked  or  did  braver  service.  He 
was  twice  wounded.  When  the  war  was  over  and 
men  were  called  upon  t  o  follow  Gen.  John 
O'Neill  in  the  Fenian  invasion  of  Canada,  Sergeant 
Hickey  (alias  Burke)  took  his  place  under  the  Green 
Flag.  He  was  in  the  battle  c  f  Ridgway,  but  later, 
when  the  failure  to  sustain  its  victors  left  them  at 
the  mercy  of  the  enemy,  he  was  one  of  those  cap- 
tured and  sentenced  to  death.  The  late  Archbishop 
Lynch  prepared  him  for  the  scaffold,  which,  how- 
ever, he  escaped  by  a  conamutation  of  his  .'■entence 
to  twenty  years'  imprisonment.  He  spent  5  y<»arB 
and  S  months  of  this  in  jail  near  Toronto,  and  was 
reprieved  about  16  years  ago.  Sergeant  Hickey 
then  returned  to  Ireland  and  took  charge  of  his 
farming  property.  The  Land  League  came  and 
found  in  the  brave  American  soldier  as  enthusiast- 
ic an  advocate  as  there  was  in  Ireland.  He  organ- 
ized the  tenants,  fought  the  landlord  candidates 
and  succeeded  in  bettering  the  condition  of  his 
neighbors  by  calling  attention  to  their  condition. 
For  all  this,  however,  he  had  to  pay  dearly.  A 
"marked"  man,  he  was  singled  out  for  vengeance 
and  made  to  feel  the  bitteiest  wrongs  of  the  system 
against  which  he  battled  with  Michael  Davitt. 
Ruin  stared  him  in  the  face  and  he  again  sailed  for 
Anaerica,  a  year  ago  last  November,  leaving  his 
wife  and  four  children  behind  him,  to  begin  the 
battle  of  life  over.  Those  who  met  him  could  trace 
but  little  of  the  handsome  regular  features  of  the 
dashing  soldier,  whose  courage  was  the  boast  of 
his  comrades.  Prematurely  gray  and  almost 
broken  down,  he  was  hardly  fitted  for  the  strug- 
gle before  him.  After  a  short  time  in  Boston,  he 
came  on  to  New  York,  and  through  the  influence 
of  a  friend  and  comrade,  he  was  given  a  position 
by  Postmaster  Van  Cott,  on  the  10th  of  Ju  y,  and 
he  seemed  to  feel  that  fortune  beamed  upon  him 
for  good.  He  had  made  himself  popular  with  every 
one  in  our  great  Federal  building  in  the  last  three 
weeks,  from  the  Postmaster  down.  On  Sunday  last, 
while  preparing  for  Mass  at  the  home  of  his  cous- 
in Mr.  Patrick  Carrick,  foreman  of  the  Irish 
World  composing  room,  in  Washington  Av.,  Brook 
lyn.  Mr.  Hickey  was  suddenly  stricken  down,  and 
within  fifteen  minutes  his  earthly  troubles  were 
over.  On  Tuesday  the  sod  was  turned  upon  his 
remains  in  Holy  Cross  Cemetery,  Flatbush,  L.  I., 
and  the  sorrow  of  those  who  knew  and  admired 
him  for  his  devotion  to  liberty,  both  here  and  in 
Ireland  was  given  vent  to  by  most  affectionate  tri- 
butes. May  God  rest  his  soul  and  inspire  others 
with  equal  zeal  for  the  betterment  of  our  kind  and 
our  race  is  the  wish  of  the  editor  of  The  Ir  ish 
World.
